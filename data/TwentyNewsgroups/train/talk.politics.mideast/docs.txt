I don't like this comment about "Typical" thinking. You could state\nyour interpretation of Exodus without it. As I read Exodus I can see \na lot of killing there, which is painted by the author of the bible\nin ideological/religious colors. The history in the desert can be seen\nas an ethos of any nomadic people occupying a land. That's why I think\nit is a great book with which descendants Arabs, Turks and Mongols can \nunify as well.
maybe the missile didn't hit directly such that his body\ngets "desintegrated."  of course, destroying 10 houses to\nkill someone is not a surgical operation, or is it?
First of all I never said the Holocaust. I said before the\nHolocaust. I'm not ignorant of the Holocaust and know more\nabout Nazi Germany than most people (maybe including you). \n	What I resent is ignorant statements that call people\nnames when they disagree with your position. Opposing the\natrocities commited by the Israeli governement hardly qualifies\nas anti-semitism. If you think name calling is a valid form of\nargument in intellectual circles, you need to get out more\noften.\n	I don't think the suffering of some Jews during WWII\njustifies the crimes commited by the Israeli government. Any\nattempt to call Civil liberterians like myself anti-semetic is\nnot appreciated.
Nobody ever exposed your crimes like that before? What was your personal \nrole in the murder of Orhan Gunduz and Kemal Arikan, again? How many more\nMuslims will be slaughtered by 'SDPA.ORG' as publicly declared and filed\nwith legal authorities? Please spell it out for us.\n\n\n "...that more people have to die..." \n\n                    SDPA <91@urartu.UUCP>\n\n  "Yes, I stated this and stand by it."\n\n                    SDPA <255@urartu.UUCP>\n\n\n    	January 28, 1982 - Los Angeles\n	Kemal Arikan is slaughtered by two Armenians while driving to work. \n\n    	March 22, 1982 - Cambridge, Massachusetts\n	Prelude to grisly murder. A gift and import shop belonging to\n	Orhan Gunduz is blown up. Gunduz receives an ultimatum: Either \n        he gives up his honorary position or he will be "executed". He \n        refuses. "Responsibility" is claimed by JCAG and SDPA.\n\n    	May 4, 1982 - Cambridge, Massachusetts\n	Orhan Gunduz, the Turkish honorary consul in Boston, would not bow \n	to the Armenian terrorist ultimatum that he give up his title of \n	"honorary consul". Now he is attacked and murdered in cold blood.\n	President Reagan orders an all-out manhunt-to no avail. An eye-\n	witness who gave a description of the murderer is shot down.  He \n	survives... but falls silent. One of the most revolting "triumphs" in \n	the senseless, mindless history of Armenian terrorism. Such a murder \n	brings absolutely nothing - except an ego boost for the murderer \n	within the Armenian terrorist underworld, which is already wallowing \n	in self-satisfaction.\n \nWere you involved in the murder of Sarik Ariyak? \n\n   	December 17, 1980 - Sydney\n	Two Nazi Armenians massacre Sarik Ariyak and his bodyguard, Engin \n        Sever. JCAG and SDPA claim responsibility.\n\nIt is public knowledge that the founder of the Marxist-Leninist terrorist \norganization, the ASALA (an integral part of ASALA/SDPA/ARF), Hagop\nHagopian, began his notorious career as a member of the terrorist \ngroup which perpetrated the massacre of the Israeli athletes at the\nMunich Olympics in 1972. And the 'Armenian Foundation' stole from the \nchildren of Turkiye to fund the criminal activities of the ASALA/SDPA/ARF\nterrorists in their cold-blooded murder of defenceless Turkish and\nKurdish people. \n\nTHE ARMENIAN FOUNDATION PROVIDED 30 BILLION TL TO ASALA\n\n    01/09/92, MILLIYET-- The Armenian Foundation based in\nIstanbul is found to have provided 30 billion Turkish Lira ($6\nmillion) to the Armenian terrorist organization ASALA which have\nmurdered several Turkish diplomats abroad... \n\nExperts on international terrorism assert that the Armenian terrorists\nuse proceeds from drug trafficking (and from the Armenian Foundation)\nto fund their deadly enterprises. The deadliest of terrorist assassins,\nCarlos, proclaimed on Spanish television that his organization had\nentered into a working relationship with Armenian terrorists and they\nare using drug trafficking to raise money 'to continue' to slaughter\ninnocent people. Now, what is your personal and organizational role \nin this scheme?\n\nRecent reports which have been confirmed by the U.S. Administration, \nindicate that Armenian terrorist organizations are collaborating with \nthose who are responsible for the bombing of the United States Marine \nbarracks in Beirut. You won't be able to get away with your crimes \nforever; the justice is long overdue.\n\nAs for the Armenian genocide of 2.5 million Muslim people between \n1914 and 1920:\n\nSource: Documents: Volume I (1919).\n        "Document No: 42," Archive No: 1-2, Cabin No: 110, Drawer \n        No: 1(4), File No: 373, Section No: 1484(1032), Contents No: 9, 9-1.\n        (To the Office of Acting Supreme Commander - Acting Assistant\n        Section Director Major Ali Sukru)\n\n"It is sufficient to mention just some of the terrible and shameful crimes\n committed only in Erzurum to get an idea about the Armenian atrocities\n in the villages...\n\n I would also like to mention with disgust and abominable sight, a stain\n on humanity, that I encountered at the west of Hasankale while my regiment\n was proceeding into this town. There was a young Turkish women, apparently\n once a very beautiful one, lying dead on one side of the road. A huge\n stick had been inserted into her vagina.

It is more appropriate to address netters with their names as they appear in\ntheir signatures (I failed to do so since you did not bother to sign your\nposting). Not only because it is the polite thing to do, but also to avoid\naddressing ladies with "Mr.", as you have done.\n\nSecondly, the island of which the name is more correctly spelled as Cyprus has\nnever been Greek, but rather, it has been home to a bi-communal society formed\nof Greeks and Turks. It seems that you know as little about the history and\nthe demography of the island, as you know about the essence of Turkey's \nmilitary intervention to it under international agreements.\n\nBe that as it may, an analogy between an act of occupation in history and what\nis going on today on Azerbaijani land, can only be drawn with the expansionist\npolicy that Armenia is now pursuing.\n\nBut, I could agree that it is not for us to issue diagnoses to the political\nconduct of countries, and promulgate them in such terminology as\n"itchy-bitchy"... \n\nOnur Yalcin

One of these days you'll learn that the way to stop Israel\nfrom fighting back is to stop attacking.  If there were no attacks in\nthe security zone for a year because the Lebanese army could maintain\nthe peace, then Lebanon would be in much better shape.\n\n	Tell me something, though.  Why do Syrian troops not get\nattacked?  Aren't they occupying Lebanon?\n\n	Israel has repeatedly stated that it will leave on two\nconditions.  One is a demonstration that the Lebanese army can keep\nthe peace.  The second is that the Syrians pull out as well.\n\nAdam\nAdam Shostack 				       adam@das.harvard.edu
I took your advice and ordered a copy of the Washinton Report.  I\nheartily recommend it to all pro-Israel types for the following \nreasons:\n\n1.  It is an excellent absorber of excrement.  I use it to line\n    the bottom of my parakeet's  cage.  A negative side effect is\n    that my bird now has a somewhat warped view of the mideast.\n\n2.  It makes a great April Fool's joke, i.e., give it to someone\n    who knows nothing about the middle east and then say "April\n    Fools".\n\nAnyway, I plan to call them up every month just to keep getting\nthose free sample magazines (you know how cheap we Jews are).\n\nBTW, when you call them, tell 'em barf sent you.\n\nJust Kidding,
Dear friends,\n\nI am a graduate student in Education at the University of Tennessee.

The lengthy article you quote doesn't imply this.  It only states that\nit is somehow POSSIBLE, not that it is in any way likely.  This is akin\nto an article saying that it is POSSIBLE that the USAF has several\ncaptured UFOs, without supporting the liklihood of such an assertion.\n\n\nIn other words, they were telling a pesky reporter to keep guessing.\n\nIsrael maintains this same attitude about nuclear weapons it may or\nmay not have.  The US maintains the same attitude about the presence\nof nuclear weapons on specific naval craft.  By refusing to\nacknowledge the existence of such weapons on specific ships, US\nwarships have, I believe, become unwelcome in New Zealand, which has\ndeclared itself a nuclear-free-zone.  \n\n\nThe USAF has never officially admitted to having any UFOs, either.\n\n\nThis is stated as a fact without supporting evidence.  It would've\nbeen more convincing if your reporter had come up with just one name\nof someone who is sitting in jail, lost to the world, as he suggests.\nMaybe Elvis, or JFK, somebody.  \n\nLet's put it this way: If Israel has put people away without\npublicizing their arrests or the legal proceedings against them, how\nhas their disappearance been explained?  People have relatives,\nfriends and colleagues, you know.  Israel is not known as a place\nwhere people are made to vanish.  Would you care to give us a list of\npeople whose whereabouts are unknown?  People who are presumed to be\nimprisoned?  This whole conspiracy story isn't something that we've\ncome to associate with Yigal Arens before.  Perhaps from now on, we\nshould.
From: Center for Policy Research <cpr>\nSubject: From Israeli press. Madness.\n\n/* Written  4:34 pm  Apr 16, 1993 by cpr@igc.apc.org in igc:mideast.forum */\n/* ---------- "From Israeli press. Madness." ---------- */\nFROM THE ISRAELI PRESS.\n\nPaper: Zman Tel Aviv (Tel Aviv's time). Friday local Tel Aviv's\npaper, affiliated with Maariv.\n\nDate: 19 February 1993\n\nJournalist: Guy Ehrlich\n\nSubject: Interview with soldiers who served in the Duvdevan\n(Cherry) units, which disguise themselves as Arabs and operate\nwithin the occupied territories.\n\nExcerpts from the article:\n\n"A lot has been written about the units who disguise themselves as\nArabs, things good and bad, some of the falsehoods. But the most\nimportant problem of those units has been hardly dealt with. It is\nthat everyone who serves in the Cherry, after a time goes in one\nway or another insane".\n\nA man who said this, who will here be called Danny (his full name\nis known to the editors) served in the Cherry. After his discharge\nfrom the army he works as delivery boy. His pal, who will here be\ncalled Dudu was also serving in the Cherry, and is now about to\ndepart for a round-the-world tour. They both look no different\nfrom average Israeli youngsters freshly discharged from conscript\nservice. But in their souls, one can notice something completely\ndifferent....It was not easy for them to come out with disclosures\nabout what happened to them. And they think that to most of their\nfellows from the Cherry it woundn't be easy either. Yet after they\nbegan to talk, it was nearly impossible to make them stop talking.\nThe following article will contain all the horror stories\nrecounted with an appalling openness.\n\n(...) A short time ago I was in command of a veteran team, in\nwhich some of the fellows applied for release from the Cherry. We\ncalled such soldiers H.I. 'Hit by the Intifada'. Under my command\nwas a soldier who talked to himself non-stop, which is a common\nphenomenon in the Cherry. I sent him to a psychiatrist. But why I\nshould talk about others when I myself feel quite insane ? On\nFridays, when I come home, my parents know I cannot be talked to\nuntil I go to the beach, surf a little, calm down and return. The\nkeys of my father's car must be ready for in advance, so that I\ncan go there. I they dare talk to me before, or whenever I don't\nwant them to talk to me, I just grab a chair and smash it\ninstantly. I know it is my nerve:  Smashing chairs all the time\nand then running away from home, to the car and to the beach. Only\nthere I become normal.(...)\n\n(...) Another friday I was eating a lunch prepared by my mother.\nIt was an omelette of sorts. She took the risk of sitting next to\nme and talking to me. I then told my mother about an event which\nwas still fresh in my mind. I told her how I shot an Arab, and how\nexactly his wound looked like when I went to inspect it. She began\nto laugh hysterically. I wanted her to cry, and she dared laugh\nstraight in my face instead ! So I told her how my pal had made a\nmincemeat of the two Arabs who were preparing the Molotov\ncocktails. He shot them down, hitting them beautifully, exactly as\nthey deserved. One bullet had set a Molotov cocktail on fire, with\nthe effect that the Arab was burning all over, just beautifully. I\nwas delighted to see it.  My pal fired three bullets, two at the\nArab with the Molotov cocktail, and the third at his chum. It hit\nhim straight in his ass. We both felt that we'd pulled off\nsomething.\n\nNext I told my mother how another pal of mine split open the guts\nin the belly of another Arab and how all of us ran toward that\nspot to take a look. I reached the spot first. And then that Arab,\nblood gushing forth from his body, spits at me. I yelled: 'Shut\nup' and he dared talk back to me in Hebrew! So I just laughed\nstraight in his face. I am usually laughing when I stare at\nsomething convulsing right before my eyes. Then I told him: 'All\nright, wait a moment'. I left him in order to take a look at\nanother wounded Arab. I asked a soldier if that Arab could be\nsaved, if the bleeding from his artery could be stopped with the\nhelp of a stone of something else like that. I keep telling all\nthis to my mother, with details, and she keeps laughing straight\ninto my face. This infuriated me. I got very angry, because I felt\nI was becoming mad. So I stopped eating, seized the plate with he\nomelette and some trimmings still on, and at once threw it over\nher head. Only then she stopped laughing. At first she didn't know\nwhat to say.\n\n(...) But I must tell you of a still other madness which falls\nupon us frequently. I went with a friend to practice shooting on a\nfield. A gull appeared right in the middle of the field. My friend\nshot it at once. Then we noticed four deer standing high up on the\nhill above us. My friend at once aimed at one of them and shot it.\nWe enjoyed the sight of it falling down the rock. We shot down two\ndeer more and went to take a look. When we climbed the rocks we\nsaw a young deer, badly wounded by our bullet, but still trying to\nsuch some milk from its already dead mother. We carefully\ninspected two paths, covered by blood and chunks of torn flesh of\nthe two deer we had hit. We were just delighted by that sight. We\nhad hit'em so good ! Then we decided to kill the young deer too,\nso as spare it further suffering. I approached, took out my\nrevolver and shot him in the head several times from a very short\ndistance. When you shoot straight at the head you actually see the\nbullets sinking in.  But my fifth bullet made its brains fall\noutside onto the ground, with the effect of splattering lots of\nblood straight on us. This made us feel cured of the spurt of our\nmadness. Standing there soaked with blood, we felt we were like\nbeasts of prey. We couldn't explain what had happened to us. We\nwere almost in tears while walking down from that hill, and we\nfelt the whole day very badly.\n\n(...) We always go back to places we carried out assignments in.\nThis is why we can see them. When you see a guy you disabled, may\nbe for the rest of his life, you feel you got power. You feel\nGodlike of sorts."\n\n(...) Both Danny and Dudu contemplate at least at this moment\nstudying the acting. Dudu is not willing to work in any\nsecurity-linked occupation. Danny feels the exact opposite. 'Why\nshouldn't I take advantage of the skills I have mastered so well ?\nWhy shouldn't I earn $3.000 for each chopped head I would deliver\nwhile being a mercenary in South Africa ? This kind of job suits\nme perfectly. I have no human emotions any more. If I get a\nreasonable salary I will have no problem to board a plane to\nBosnia in order to fight there."
You are brain damaged. That hate of++0B1FATransfer cancelledf yours courses\nthrough your sick body like poison. It's just a matter of time. Your fate\nis sealed.
The idea of the U.S, or any other nation, taking action, i.e., military\nintervention, in Bosnia has not been well thought out by those who \nadvocate such action. After the belligerants are subdued, it would require\nan occupation force for one or two generations. If you will stop and\nthink about it, you will realize that these people have never forgotten\na single slight or injury, they have imbibed hatred with their mother's\nmilk. If we stop the fighting, seize and destroy all weapons, they will\nsimply go back to killing each other with clubs. And the price for this\nfutility will be the lives of the young men and women we send there to\ndie. A price I am unwilling to even consider.\n\n\nThere is no valid comparison to the Holocaust. All of the Jewish people\nthat I have known as friends were not brought up to hate. To be wary of\nothers, most certainly, but not to hate. And except for the Warsaw\nuprising, they were unarmed (and even in Warsaw badly out-gunned).\nIt is very easy to speak of muscle when they are someone else's muscles.\nSuppose we do this thing, what will you tell the parents, wives, children,\nlovers of those we are sending to die? That they gave their lives in some noble cause? Noble cause, separating some mad dogs who will turn on them.\n\nWell, I will offer you some muscle. Suppose we tell them that they have\none week (this will give foreign nationals time to leave) to cease\ntheir bloodshed. At the end of that week, bring in the Tomahawk firing\nships and destroy Belgrade as they destroyed the Bosnian cities. Perhaps\nwhen some of their cities are reduced to rubble they will have a sudden\nattack of brains. Send in missiles by all means, but do not send in\ntroops.\n\n\nBy all means lift the embargo.\n\n\nWhich killers? Do you honestly believe they are all on one side?
the last arab country was syria. but not all of them\nmigrated due to the jewish state economical and \nsecurital dilemma!

[1]\n\nBorn 1964\nSecretary-Typist\nAzsantekmontazh Trust\nSumgait Construction and Installation Administration\nSecretary of the SMU Komsomol Organization\n\nResident at Building 17/33B, Apartment 15\nMicrodistrict No. 3\nSumgait [Azerbaijan]\n\n\nOn the 27th my sister Marina and I went to the movies the seven o'clock show,\nat the theater that is across from the City Party Committee, about 50 yards \naway. The SK theater. They were showing an Argentinian film, "The Abyss." \nBefore the film we noticed about 60 to 70 people standing near the podium at \nthe City Party Committee, but they were silent, there's no conversation \nwhatsoever, and we couldn't figure out what was going on. That is, we knew it \nwas about Karabagh, but what it was exactly, what they were talking about, if \nsomeone gave a speech or not, we didn't know. We bought our tickets. There \nwere 30 or 40 people in the theater. This was a very small number for that \nlarge movie theater. The film started. About 30 minutes later they stopped the\nfilm. A crowd burst in. About 60 people. They came up onto the stage. Well \nmostly they were young people, from 16 to 23 years old. They demanded that an \nArmenian woman come up onto the stage. They used foul language and said that \nthey were going to show what Azerbaijanis were capable of, what they could do \nto Armenian girls. I thought that's what they meant because they had demanded \na girl specifically. Marina and I were sitting together. I told her to move \nover, there were some Russian girls sitting nearby. So that if someone \nrecognized me or if something happened, they would take me, and not Marina. \nIt got quiet, 2 or 3 girls jumped up to run out, but the door was closed--it's\nonly opened at the end of the   show--and they returned to their seats. \nEveryone in the theater was looking at one another, Russians, Azerbaijanis, \npeople of various nationalities. But no one reacted at all, no one in the \nauditorium made a sound. They were silent, looking at one another, and \ngradually started to leave. Some guy, a really fat one, says, "OK, we've \nscared them enough, let's leave." They leave slowly, pompously. It seemed to \nme that those people were not themselves. Either they had smoked a bunch of \n"anasha", or had taken something else, because they all looked beastly, like \nthey were ready to tear anyone apart. Then it was all over, as though nothing \nhad happened at all. The film started up again, it was one of those cheerful \nfilms which should have only brought pleasure, made you happy to be alive. We \ncould barely sit to the end. So it had started at seven it was over by nine, \nand it was dark . . .\n\nMarina and I were walking home, Lenin Street, that's the center of town. Lenin\nStreet was packed, just packed with young people. They were shouting, \nsomething about Karabagh and something about Armenians. We weren't especially \nlistening, because the way we were feeling we didn't know if we were going to \nmake it home or not, and just what had happened anyway? Public transportation \nwasn't running. Incidentally, when we came out of the theater we saw police, \npolicemen standing there. The director of the movie theater was looking at the\ndoors, because when they were leaving they had broken the glass, the doors \nthere are basically all glass. Everything was broken. He stood there grief-\nstricken, but looking as though nothing really big had happened, like some \nnaughty boys had just broken them quite by accident, with a slingshot. Well, \nsince he looked more or less calm I decided that, nothing all that super \nserious had happened. We went out very slowly; we wanted to catch a bus, we \nlive literally one stop away. We didn't want to go on foot, not because it was\ndark, but because something might happen. We flagged down a cab, but the \ndriver didn't want to take us. We told him we live near the bus station, and \nhe said he'd take us to the bus station and not a yard farther. I said, well, \nOK . . .\n\nSo we got into the cab and managed to get there. Something incredible was \nhappening at the bus station. There was a traffic jam. Public transportation \nwas at a standstill and everyone was shouting "Ka-ra-bagh," they're not going \nto give up Karabagh. I go home and tell my family what's going on, and there's\nimmediate panic in the house. Mamma says, what should we do? Like the end had \ncome, they were going to come, kill us, that's it . . . Somehow we managed to \ncheer ourselves up: Nothing that bad could happen. Where are we living anyway,\njust what kind of social order do we have? Somehow we manage to calm Mamma \ndown. And we went to bed. But no one could sleep. Everyone made as though \nnothing had happened.\n\nThat was on Saturday. In short, the day went by. We didn't go anywhere and \ndidn't call our relatives. No one did anything. Because . . . life goes on.\nThat day I realized something was approaching, but what exactly, I couldn't\nguess.\n\nOn the 28th everything was like it was supposed to be, we lived like we always\nhad. There were five of us at home: Mamma, Papa and us, three sisters: Lyuda, \nMarina, and I. My sister Lyuda was in Yerevan at the time. We sat at home and \nno one went out. Later we learned that a demonstration had started that \nmorning. It all started . . . They were smashing up stores. We were sitting at\nhome and didn't know anything about it. Then a girlfriend of mine, Lyuda \nZimogliad, came by at around three o'clock I think. We worked together, we did\nour apprenticeships together, she's a Russian girl. She said that something\nawful was happening in town. I asked, "Don't they want Armenians? Well what \nare they after, if they're already in that state?" She says, no, nothing like \nthat, it's just a demonstration, but it's awful to watch it. Somehow, it feels\nlike a war has broken out. Public transportation has been stopped . . . The \ncabs, the buses, well it's just a nightmare.\n\nThen Papa decides to go to the drugstore, my mother was having allergy \nproblems at the time . . . He left the house and our neighbor, Aunt Vera,\nasked him, "Where are you going? Stop! There are such terrible things going\non in the courtyard; aren't you afraid to go out?" Papa didn't know what she\nwas talking about. She simply pushed him back into the entryway. He came home \nand told Mamma. Mamma said, "Well, if Aunt Vera was talking like that it means\nthat something is really going on." But we didn't go see her, she's a Russian,\nshe lives across from us. I had to see my friend out. Around five o'clock I \ntell Lyuda, "Ok, look, it's time for you to go, it's late already, I'll see \nyou out." Mamma says, "You don't need to go, it's too late already, you can \nsee what the situation in town is." So we decided to stay home. Dinner was \nready. Mamma says, "Let her eat with us, then she can go." We sat down at the \ntable. But no one was hungry, no one was in the mood, we just put everything \nout on the table to calm ourselves down, and make it appear that we're eating.\nWe turned on the television, and the show "In Fairy-Tale Land" was coming on. \nWe cleared the table.\n\nWe hear some noise out in the courtyard. I go out on the balcony, but I can't \nsee what's going on, because the noise is coming from the direction of the bus\nstation, and there is a 9-story building in the way. There is mob of people \n. . . I can't figure out what's happening. They're shouting something, looking\nsomewhere, I can't make out what is going on. I go down to a neighbor, she's \nan Azerbaijani; we've been friends of her family for about 25 years. I go down\nto look from their place. I see people shouting, looking at the 5-and 9-story \nbuildings near the bus station. Just then soldiers set upon them, about 20 \npeople, with clubs. The mob runs off in different directions. I even see \nseveral people from our building. They are looking and laughing . . . I decide\nthat means it's not all that bad if they are laughing: it means they're not \nkilling anyone. But now the crowd suddenly dashes toward the soldiers. One of \nthe soldiers cannot manage to get away, they start stomping on him with their \nfeet, everyone's kicking him . . . I become ill and go home, and explain in \ngeneral terms that horrible things are going on out there . . .  can't speak\n. . . Well, they've probably killed that soldier, the way that crowd is . . .\nIf each of them kicked him just once . . . They took his club away from him\nand started to beat him with it. But it was far away and I couldn't see if he\ngot up and left or not.\n\nI become terrified and go home and say, "Lyuda, don't go anywhere, stay at our\nplace, because if you go out they could kill you or . . . " Then the crowd \nruns over closer toward our building and stands at the 12-story building and \nstarts shouting something. We go out onto the balcony. All of our neighbors \nare also out on theirs, too. Everyone is standing, staring. The mob is \nshouting and about 5 minutes later comes running toward our building. As it \nturns out, at the 12-story building the Azerbaijani neighbors went down and \nkept them from coming in. There's only one entryway there, they could stop \nthem.\n\nThey all run up to our building. Mamma immediately starts closing the windows,\nafraid that they might throw stones. They have stones and they break the \nwindows, all of them. There are very many people. We have a large courtyard, \nand it's packed with people. They spill up to the first floor so they don't \ncrush each other. They crawl up on trees, posts, and garages. It's just a huge\ncloud of people. They break and burn the motorcycle of the Armenian Sergey \nSargisian, from our building. We close the windows and immediately hear \ntramping in our entryway. They come up to our fifth floor with a tremendous \ndin and roar. It's incomprehensible. Mamma told me later that they were \nshouting Father's name, "Grisha, open the door, we've come to kill you!," or\nsomething like that. I don't remember that, I was spaced out, kind of. Mamma \nsays, "Into the bedroom, quickly!" In the bedroom we have two tall beds, part \nof our dowry; Mamma says, "Hide there, they probably won't come in there, \nthey'll ask something, say something, and leave." She says, "We'll tell them \nthat we live alone here." I can't imagine that my parents will stand out in \nthe hall alone talking with some sort of beasts . . . I go to them and say \nthat I'll stand together with them, I'll talk with them if they come, maybe I \ncan find a common language with them, all the more so if they know me: I speak \nAzerbaijani more or less, and I can find out what they want. I told Marina and\nLyuda to hide under the bed, and my sister Lyuda, I can't remember if I told \nher anything or not.\n\nThen . . . they open the door: it's like they blew on it and it broke and fell\nright into the hall. The crows bursts in and starts to shout: Get out of here,\nleave, vacate the apartment and go back to your Armenia; things like that. I\ntell them, "What has happened, speak calmly. One of you, tell me, calmly, what\nhas happened." In Azerbaijani, they say, "Get out of the apartment, leave." I \nsay, "OK. Go downstairs. We'll gather everything we need and leave the \napartment." I realize that it is senseless to discuss any sort of rights with\nthem, these are animals. They must be stopped. The ones standing in the\ndoorway, the young guys, say, "There are old people and one girl with them.\nToo bad!" They take two or three steps back. It seems as though I have\npacified them with our exchange. Then someone in the courtyard shouts, \ncommanding them: "Don't you understand what you are saying? Kill them?"\n\nAnd that was it! That was all it took. They grab Papa, carry him into one\nroom, and Mamma and me into another. They put Mamma on the bed and start \nundressing her, beating her legs. They start tearing my clothes, right there, \nin front of Mamma. I don't remember where they went, what they did, or how \nmuch time passed. I had the feeling that they beat me on the head, on my body,\nand tore my clothes, all at the same time, I don't even know what I said. The \natrocities started. I was savagely raped in that room. They argued among \nthemselves who would go first.\n\nLater, I remember, I came to. I don't know if I'm dead or alive. Someone comes\nin, someone tall, I think, clean-shaven, in an Eskimo dogskin coat, balding. \nHe looks around at what's happening. At that instant everything stops. It \nseems to me that he is either their commander or . . . that somehow everything\ndepends on him. He looks and says, "Well, we're done here." They are beating\nMamma on the head. They break up the chairs and beat her with the chair legs \n. . . She loses consciousness, and they decide that she's dead. Papa . . . was\nout cold. They want to throw Lyuda off the balcony, but they can't get the \nwindow open. Apparently the window frames are stuck after the rain and the \nwindows can't be opened. They leave her next to the window. She was thinking \nabout being thrown out the window and passed out. She's not a real strong \nperson anyway . . . He looks at me and sees that I'm saying something, that\nI'm still twitching. Well, I start saying the opposite of what I should be, \nwhich is humbling myself and pleading. I start shouting, cursing . . . they \ndon't get any entreaty out of me. I  already know that I'm dead, why would I \nhumble myself before anyone? And he says that if that's what I think, since my\ntongue is so long . . . maybe he thinks that I still look quite appealing \n. . . In short, he commands that I be taken outside.\n\nI no longer saw or remembered what was happening to Marina and Lyuda, I don't \nknow if they are alive or not. They take me outside. They are dragging me by \nmy arms, by my legs. They are hitting me against the wall, the railings, \nsomething metal . . . While they are carrying me someone is biting me, someone\nelse is pinching me . . .I don't even know. I think, my God, when will death \ncome? If only it were sooner . . . Then . . . they carry me out, throw me near\nthe entryway . . . and start kicking me. I lose consciousness . . . What \nhappened after that, how many people there were, I don't remember.\n \nI come to after a while, I don't remember how long. A neighbor is bringing me \nclothing. I'm entirely covered with blood, she puts a dress on me. I remember \nthat I said the same words over and over again: "Mamma, what happened, Mamma, \nwhat have they done to us, where are we, whose house are we at?" I can't make \nsense out of anything. There is a guy standing over me, I sort of know him, he\nserved in Afghanistan, his name is Igor, he brought me indoors. When they all \nwent to the third entryway and killed a person there, Igor gathered his \ncourage, took me into his arms, and brought me to the neighbors', even though \nhe's small-minded, he put himself at risk. Igor Agayev is Azerbaijani; he \nserved in Afghanistan. There are three brothers. The older brother also served\nthere, I think; now he's stationed here, on the border, in Armenia. Igor \nbrought me to the neighbors', and then helped me come to my senses, saying, \n"Karina, I know you, calm down, I'm not one of them." How do I know who's who \nand what's what? I come to, and they clean me up. I was covered in blood. Then\nPapa . . . I saw Papa, I saw Mamma. And Marina, too . . . Igor was there when \nthey dragged Marina and Lyuda out from under the bed . . . Marina . . . Lyuda \nsaid that she was Russian, they said, we'll let you go, we aren't touching the\nRussians, go. And while they are dragging Marina out she decides she's going \nto tell them she's Azerbaijani. Igor immediately grabs Marina's and Lyuda's \nhands, because he knows Marina, and knows that she is Armenian and is our \nsister, and takes her to the second floor to a neighbor's and starts pounding \non the door so she will open up. She opens the door and Igor pushes them in \nthere. So they survived.\n\nMy sister Lyuda lost consciousness after the bandits started stealing things.\nWhile they were going downstairs, taking things downstairs, then coming back \nup again, Lyuda seized the opportunity and crawled under the bed and stayed \nthere. Then, when she was herself again, she found a torn night shirt and put \nit on, and some sort of robe and went to a neighbor's on the fourth floor, the\none whose apartment I had watched the crowd from, the friend of ours, and \nknocked on the door. The neighbor opened and said, "I'm not going to let you \nin the apartment because I'm afraid of them. But I'll give you some stockings \nand we'll leave the building." Lyuda says, "I'll stay at your place because of\nwhat's going on, they keep going up and down the stairs." It was just for a \nmoment, just a moment in life, but the neighbor wouldn't consent. Lyuda came \nback to our place and lay under the bed . . .\n\nI came to. Mother was there. I can't remember my supervisor's telephone \nnumber, but something had to be done. Somehow I remembered and called, and he \ncame to get us. He didn't have any idea what was going on. He thought we were \nsimply afraid, he didn't know that they were killing us and that we had passed\nbetween life and death. He came and got us and took us to the police precinct.\nThere they looked us over. I was having trouble walking, my lungs hurt badly, \nit was hard to breathe . . .\n\nMy supervisor's name is Urshan Feyruzovich Mamedov. He's the head of our \nadministration. They took us there. When we were leaving, I saw a great number\nof buses full of soldiers at the entrance to town. The buses were ordinary \npassenger buses. There were very many soldiers. We left around eleven, right \nafter eleven. If these people could stop what was happening they could save a \ngreat many lives . . . Because the crowd was moving on, toward the school, and\nwhat was going on there . . . I think everyone know not only in Sumgait, not \nonly in Yerevan. Because there they murdered them all one after the next, \nwithout stopping. After us.\n\nI think 14 people died in Microdistrict No. 3, and 10 to 12 of them were from\nBuildings 4, 5, and 6. In our building one person died, and one old woman died\nfrom Building 16, that's the building in front of ours. There young \nAzerbaijani men stopped the mob and wouldn't let it into their building. \nIncidentally, when we were at the neighbors', Marina called our relatives\nto warn them, so they would all know what was happening. I called a aunt in \nMicrodistrict No. 5. They have three neighbors who are Armenians. I said, "Run\nquickly, I can't explain what's going on; hide, do what you can, just stay\nalive. Hide at Azerbaijanis', ones who won't give you away." At that moment \nthree people came in, policemen. I think they were Azerbaijanis. I was in such\nawful condition, my face was completely distorted my lips were puffed up, \nthere was blood, my eye was swollen, no one thought I would ever see anything \nout of that eye again . . . my forehead was badly cut, and one-half of my face\nwas pushed out forward. No one would have thought that I would survive, get my\nnormal appearance back, and be able to grasp anything at all. I started to \nscream at those people, why did you come, who sent you here, no one wants you \nhere, haven't you killed people people yet, what are you doing here? One of \nthe soldiers said, "Don't scream at us. We're Muslims, but we're not from the \nSumgait police. They called in from Daghestan." So at that point the \nDaghestan police were there.\n\nWhen we got to the police precinct there were an awful lot of police there,\nthere were soldiers, police with dogs, ambulances, firemen . . . I don't know,\nmaybe they were waiting for people to bring them the goners and the seriously \ninjured to treat them there in the police precinct. I don't know what they \nwere there for. There were also doctors from Baku there. They examined Lyuda \nand me and said, "These women need to go to the Maternity Home, but we don't \nknow what to do with the rest."\n\nSo they took us, and I lost contact with my parents, my boss, everyone. My \nboss said, "Don't worry, I'll find you, no matter where you are, no matter\nwhat happens." We went to the hospital. There we were examined by a department\nhead from the Sumgait Maternity Home, Pashayeva, I think her name was. She \nexamined us. The ambulance was from Baku; I figured out that the Sumgait \nambulances hadn't done anything, they didn't respond to any calls. People \ncalled and neither the police nor the ambulances showed any sign of life.\n\nThat doctor looked me over and I could tell from her behavior that something\nvery good had happened, for she became quite glad. I even thought to myself, \n"God, can it be that nothing all that bad is wrong?" She looks me over and \nsays, "Now why are you suffering so? You don't know what your people have been\ndoing, your people did even worse things." And I think, great, I have to deal \nwith her . . . And I felt so bad, I thought, why don't I just die so as not to\nhave to hear more stuff like this from people like her? Here I am in this \ncondition and being told about something that our people did. I just didn't \nhave the energy to say, "How could our people possibly be smart enough to \nthink of something that yours haven't already done?" I stayed there. Then they\nbrought in another woman, Ira B., she was married, and she was raped in her \nown apartment, too. There were three of us, Ira, Lyuda, and 1. The next \nmorning they took Lyuda and Ira away. They didn't do anything to help us. This\nwas in the old Maternity Home, in the combined block. They didn't do anything \nmore than examine me, that was it. I didn't want any shots or tranquilizer, \nnothing. What shots could have calmed me down? I didn't even want to look at \nthem.\n\nI lay in the ward. Either it just worked out that way or they did it on pur-\npose, but I was alone. I was alone even though the wards were packed. That\nsame evening a woman came by and asked me what was wrong with me, that my face\nwas disfigured. She asked what had happened to me, and I said, "Better to ask \nyour brother what happened, there's no point in asking me, your brother can \nbetter explain what happened." She fell into a faint. All the doctors threw \nthemselves at her, and the doctor categorically forbade anyone to come into my\nward.\n\nThen people from work came to see me, my boss, his daughter; they brought me \nclothing, because I was literally naked. The only thing I had on was a dress, \nbut the woman who gave it to me was very short, and the dress was way up \nabove my knees, and the woman orderly said, "I can't believe you put on such a\nshort dress, who are you showing off your legs to here?" I went back to my \nward thinking, just one more thing from something. People from work came and \nbrought me something in a sack, apples, I think, three or four pounds, but I \ncouldn't take them. I had become so weak that it was just embarrassing. I said\nthat I couldn't take the apples, and really didn't have any appetite. No one \nhad to bring me anything. Some woman took the sack . . . And, oh yes! . . . \nThen I heard that the head doctor tell a nurse that my medical history should \nbe hidden or torn up completely so that no one would know that I was an \nArmenian, maybe they wouldn't figure it out from looking at me. So they must \nhave been thinking that there would be some kind of attack, that something \nelse would happen. That it would be worse. Or, perhaps, someone was outside on\nthe street, I don't know. In any case, I didn't sleep a wink that night.\n\nThe next morning they picked me up, a whole police detail, put me in a bus, \nand off we went. I didn't even know where they were taking me. They took me to\nthe club where the troops were, the very one I was in that ill-fated evening.\nI got off the bus. Near the City Party Committee there were a great many \ntroops, tanks, armored personnel carriers; the whole scene was terrible. I saw \na few people I knew there, and that calmed me a little. I had already thought \nthat I was the only one left. So there were five or six of us left in Sumgait \nafter that night. I still didn't know what happened to my parents, they didn't \ncome to see me in the hospital, and my boss told me that everything was fine. \nI didn't know whether to believe him or not. Maybe he was just trying to calm \nme down, maybe something happened on the way. Then I went to the club and saw \na lot of people I knew. They all knew one another, they were all kissing each \nother and asking, "What happened, what went on?" Two days later they came to \nsee me from work. They were there all the time. Each day they came, showed \ninterest, and were constantly bringing me money. They did everything they \ncould. Of course I'm most thankful to my boss, the only one of my colleagues \nwho didn't lose his presence of mind and who didn't change his opinions, \nneither before, nor after, nor in the heat of the moment, no matter what \nhappened. He constantly took an interest. A sincere interest, from the heart \n. . . Then, about two days later, the secretary of the Party Committee came, \nnot from our Party organization, but from the First Trust, which ours is part \nof, Comrade Kerimov, a very important figure in our town. He made arrangements\nwith the emergency medical personnel to take me away, because if I sat down by\nmyself I couldn't get up or lie down again. There was something wrong with my\nlungs, it was hard to breathe. They examined me there several times, there I \nlay were several doctors, they all thought that . . . that it must just be \nfrom all the blows, I don't know. They didn't diagnose anything in particular.\nWhen I was in the Maternity Home I even asked . . . I made it a point of \ninsisting that they take me to the trauma section because I felt so awful. \nThere was no way something inside wasn't broken, my ribs . . . Well they took \nme there and took x-rays and said that everything was fine. There were \nemergency medical workers on duty in the club. The mother of one of Marina's \nfriends was there. She was the head doctor at the Sumgait Children's Clinic. \nThey had every kind of antifever agent in the world, which was exactly what I\nneeded at that moment, I thought. I said that I was having great difficulty\nbreathing, I couldn't seem to get enough air, something was wrong with me.\nThey put tight bandages around my chest and waist. Later I overheard some\npeople saying that I had been cut all over. I think they just saw me being all\nbandaged up and decided that my breasts and face had been cut . . . But I\nwasn't cut.\n\nThey took us to the Khimik boarding house. We lived there a long time. Soon \nappeared representatives . . . They were agitating. At first people would not \ntalk to them, and drove them off. One of the Armenian women shouted, "We \ndemand that Seidov come!" The response was, "It's Seidov who sent us." Seidov \nis the Chairman of the Azerbaijani Council of Ministers. The woman said, \n"We'll only see Seidov's daughter, have her come here, we'll do the same \nthings to her that they did to our daughters, and then we'll deal with you \nagitators." And so on. More of them said, "Have Seidov himself come." This \nwent on day in, day out. The agitators kept coming and coming, this drove us \nout of our wits. Then people gradually started departing for Yerevan because \nthey realized it was senseless to stay. Everything got on our nerves: The \nsmell, the small children. There were children at the SK club, children who \nhad literally just come out of the Maternity Home. What were they doing in a \nclub that didn't even have running water all the time? At first we had to pay \nto eat there. They even overcharged us, as it turned out. On the second day \nsomeone told us that they would bring us food for free. The children were ill.\nEverything stank there. Well imagine about 3,000 people in a small movie \ntheater with seating for no more than 500. You couldn't sit or lie down, it \nwas impossible to even move. The stench was awful. Even the smallest infants \ntook ill overnight there. I heard that they were arriving seriously ill in \nYerevan, the infants. They have to be washed, they have to be bathed, not to \nmention that we, the adults, were ill and needed care. People were fainting \nright and left. I just don't know, everyone was crying, everyone . . . Only \nthe young people, the men, somehow managed to keep it together. But the women \nwere in a constant state of panic. It seemed to everyone that they would come \nany minute and kill and stab. It seemed clear that we had been gathered \ntogether purposely, like during the war, so that they could burn the movie \ntheater and there wouldn't be a single Armenian left. Then people went up to \nthe attic. I didn't see them, I only heard them, because I was lying down and \ncouldn't get up. I lay right on the stage, we had some room there. Apparently \nthey caught two people with either oil or gas. I think they wanted to burn the\ntheater. Maybe someone saw them, I didn't. I was in no condition to open my \neyes.\n\nEveryone was suspicious of everyone else. They would ask, "Aren't you an \nAzerbaijani? I think I saw you somewhere, I think you're an Azerbaijani." They\nled out all the men and started letting them back in by checking their\npassports, relatives might be covering for each other. Half of the people did\nnot have any documents. There were people who had run out of their homes in \nnothing but a pair of pants and slippers, or wearing just a shirt, not like\nthey should have, with their IDs.\n\nSo on the 28th, on Sunday, I think, the police did nothing to help us. On\nMonday everything resumed where it had left off on Block 41A. They didn't \nspare a soul there: not children, not pregnant women, nobody. They killed,\nthey burned, they hacked with axes, just everything possible. They murdered \nthe Melkumian family whom I knew, my mother worked with them. Their daughter-\nin-law went to school with my older sister. They were brutally murdered. Only \nthe two daughters-in-law survived. By a miracle one was able to save herself, \nshe ran away, the neighbors wouldn't take her in, so she ran about the \nbuilding until she found refuge. She was pregnant and had two small children. \nThis all continued on Monday in Block 41A, on the 29th, when the troops were \nalready in the city.\n\nThey murdered people, they overturned automobiles, and they burned entire \nfamilies. They say they didn't even know for sure if the people were Armenians\nor not. I heard that the Lezgins suffered, too. I'm not sure myself, I didn't \nsee any Lezgins who had been injured. They burned cars so it's very difficult \nnow to say exactly who died and who didn't. It was very difficult to identify \nthe corpses, or rather, what remained of the corpses after they were doused in\ngasoline and burned . . . it's all very hard to imagine, of course I heard \nthat many people disappeared without a trace, from the BTZ plant two people, \nincluding a woman who worked the night shift, Aunt Razmella, who also lived in\nMicrodistrict 3.\n\nThey were stopping buses between Baku and Sumgait. In the evening people who \nhad been visiting Baku were returning to Sumgait, and people from Baku were \ngoing home from Sumgait, and there were students, too. They were simply \nsavagely murdered. They were stopping the buses, the drivers immediately did \nwhat they were told because there was just no other way to deal with that \nhoard of brutally minded people. They stopped the buses, dragged the Armenians\nout and killed them on the spot. I didn't see it myself, but I heard that they\nput them all in a pile so as to burn them. Later it was hard to discern from \nthe corpses, well you can't call them corpses, you had to figure out from the \nashes who it was. l heard that two fellows saved two women, one a student, Ira\nG., if I'm not mistaken. She was in the hospital a long time after that, and \nshe still can't figure out who saved her. She was also brutally raped and \nbeaten and thrown onto a pile of corpses. The fellow pulled her out of that \nwhole pile of corpses, put his coat on her, took her into his arms, and \ncarried her to the city. I still can't imagine how he managed to do that.\n\nI heard that from Engels Grigorian. He knows her, apparently. Well a lot of \npeople went to that hospital anyway. She was in the hospital and singing a \nsong in Armenian, and they wrote the words down, and, I think he still has \nthat piece of paper, because he says that a lot of people now have that song, \nthe one she sang in the hospital where she lay in such bad shape. They \ncouldn't find the guy who saved her. He left her in someone's apartment and\ncalled the ambulance, she was in such awful shape that, probably, like me,\nshe couldn't remember anyone's face.\n\nI think that I knew one of the people who broke into our house, maybe I had \ntalked with him once. But I received so many blows everything was just knocked\nout of my head. I can't remember to this day who he was. Then, it seems, I saw\nthe Secretary of the Directorate's Party organization, where Marina works. She\ngoes to school and works, she goes to night school at AZI, and works by day at\nthe Khimzashchita Construction and Installation Administration. I'm the \nSecretary of the Komsomol organization at our administration and often met \nwith the secretaries of Party and Komsomol organizations. We had joint \nmeetings. I know them all, I've even talked with them, and he, I know, is from\nArmenia. An Azerbaijani, but from Armenia. It became obvious that many of \nthose people were Azerbaijanis born in Armenia.\n\nThey took me to various police stations, to the police precinct, and to the\nProcuracy, because the USSR Procuracy got involved in the case, and I iden-\ntified the photographs of people who I could more or less recognize. They\nshowed me the people who were in our apartment, they're working on our\ncase, but I can't even recognize them, although it was proved that they were\nthe ones, they're processing it somehow. They tell me that they know that\nsomeone held me by the arm and someone else held me by the leg when they were \ndragging me. There was someone else in our apartment who did not even touch \nme, he just stole a blanket and an earring or something like that. All these \npeople, all of them, as much as I've heard about them and seen them, they were\nall from Kafan.\n\nThe Secretary of the Party organization is named Najaf, Najaf Rzayev. He was \nthere when everything started. It must have been him because I didn't \nrecognize anyone else in the crowd whom I knew besides him. All the more since\nI told him, "Listen, you do something, because you know me." He turned away \nand went toward the bedroom, where Marina was. Well you couldn't see Marina \nanyway. There was such a noisy confusion of people that you couldn't make out \nanyone. All of it flew right out of my head, and then gradually I became \nmyself again, at the City Party Committee . . . There were military people \nthere. I told them what went on, and they wrote it all down. I told them his \nname. On March 8 the Secretary of our First Trust Party organization, the one \nwe're part of, came to see us, his name is Najaf Rzayev. I tell Mamma, "If\nhe's here despite the fact that I gave his name, it means that either his \nalibi has been confirmed or, probably, that they think I'm crazy, not \nresponsible for my words." He said, "What did they do to you, how awful, \nmyself, I hid an Armenian family." Then after some time goes by he comes back \nagain and says something entirely different: "I wasn't at home, my family and \nI went to Baku." I said, "Marina, what is he saying? He said something totally\ndifferent before." After that I didn't go to see our Procurator, our case is \nbeing handled by a procurator from Voronezh, Fedorov by name. Fedorov told me \nthat Rzayev's case had just gotten to him, and there were so names involved. \nWhat are they doing with Rzayev?\nDid he prove his alibi or not? They just think that since I was hit in the \nhead I can't say anything for sure, whether it was him or not. It will be an \ninsult if he was in our apartment and doesn't have to pay for it, but at the \nsame time\n\nI'm afraid to say I'm a hundred percent sure that it was he. Because no mat-\nter who I name, they tell me, no, you're wrong, he didn't do that, that one\nwasn't there. All the faces have gotten mixed up in my mind. Who did what\nexactly I can't say.                                                     \n\nWhen they took me outside there was a whole crowd there, but I didn't see it, \nbecause I had my eyes closed all the time. It seemed to me that I always got\nit because of my eyes, people were always hassling me, for some reason it \nalways seemed to me that my eyes are responsible. When they were beating my \nface I thought they were trying to put my eyes out. So I had my eyes closed, \nthey took me outside and started to beat me. A young guy, 22, held my arms, he\nworks at the BTZ plant. And right nearby, across the road from us, Block 41, \nis where all this was going on. Right across the road from us. The BTZ \ndormitory is over there, that's where he lives. Now he's in custody, they even\nhave proved, as far as I know, that it was he who killed Shurik Gambarian, the\nclarinet player from the third entryway of our building. One person in our \nbuilding was killed, it was that man.\n\nA guy comes by who shared a room with the guy who was holding me. He saw that\nhe was holding me by the arms and that he was beating me, but he didn't come \nover, he just looked and then went into the dormitory. A while after it was \nall over, people started making announcements in town saying that \ninvestigators had been summoned. That guy went and told them everything. Now \nthey've caught him, everything's been proved. Now, evidently, they've been\nbeating him, I don't know what they're doing with them over there, but he \nhimself said that he was working the night shift at the plant. Some young guy \ncame to the plant and said, "Everyone who wants to kill Armenians come to the \nbus station on Saturday at ten." That was it. He said, the ones who wanted to,\nwent. This was at the BTZ plant, during the night shift, probably, late Friday\nnight. It was at night, they were at the sauna together. And he said, what do \nyou mean, do you understand what you are saying? The others were silent, \nprobably, in their hearts they were thinking, I'm going to go. But they didn't\nsay anything to one another. He said that he thought it important to to go, \nbecause he had heard a lot about what had happened in Kafan, that they had \nkilled their Azerbaijani sisters, their mothers, burned villages, and all of \nthat. That guy was also born in Kafan. That is certain. And Marina says that \nthe Secretary of the Party organization is from Armenia, too.                                                             from\n\nI've participated in the investigation a couple of times. I'm satisfied with\nthem thus far. They summoned us and asked about what happened, and every word \nI said was recorded. I met some guy there . . . By the way, he was an \nArmenian. I said that he was in our apartment, but what he did, I don't know. \nHis last name was Grigorian, Eduard Grigorian. He s from Sumgait, from \nMicrodistrict 1. He was sentenced I think, to five years, not his first time. \nHis mother is Russian. I met with him at the KGB in Baku, at the Azerbaijani \nKGB. They took us there and showed me photographs. There were so many \nphotographs, I think they even photographed those people who were caught at \ncurfew, and I've got them all confused. I say, the face was about like this, \nthe guy in the white coat with the red clasps. But he could take that coat off\nand burn it somewhere, and it would be like looking for a needle in a \nhaystack. Well. This guy, Grigorian, I said, he was in our apartment, but he \nis so light-complected that he looks like a Lezgin. I don't know what he did, \nI can't remember. Maybe he beat me or raped me. But he was in our apartment. \nAt the KGB he started asking me, pleading with me, there's no need for this, \nall this stuff, look me in the eyes, you're like a sister to me. I took a look\nat him and thought, "My God, Heaven forbid that I should have a brother like \nyou." But they were satisfied with my responses, because I said everything \nwithout great certainty. I was there with Mamma. Then Lyuda came in, but when \nshe came in she got sick immediately. She wanted to kill him, she crawled over\nthe table at him. She recognized him. When she came to, Lyuda was lying on the\nbalcony, the mob threw her there and all of them ran into the bedroom. We had \nall kinds of boxes with dishes in them, the dowries for all three sisters. \nThey stole everything in the apartment, leaving only small things. At that \nmoment Lyuda came to and started remembering everything. Well, seeing the \nfaces, hearing the voices . . . Two people were saying they could burn the \napartment. Another says, why burn the apartment when I've got three kids and \nno place to live. So this guy was in temporary housing, he didn't have \nanywhere to live, he was from Sumgait. They were sure that they would get the \napartment. Besides, the neighbors were Azerbaijani. Why should they burn the \napartment, they might burn Azerbaijanis. That's what they said. How did they \nknow there were Azerbaijanis there, if they just picked a place, thinking that\nArmenians lived there? We have a list of the residents for our part of the \nbuilding, our name is in there, but how could they know that Azerbaijanis \nlived on the other side of the wall from us? So they didn't set fire to our \napartment.\n\nI don't know, I was in such bad shape that if all of it had come to a halt \nwhen I was outside, if someone had asked me what was happening, I would\nhave said that a civil war was going on. Well, maybe not civil . . . but\nprobably civil, because when they were beating me I opened my eyes and saw\nthat all the neighbors were standing on their balconies and watching, like at\na free horror film. So a civil war was going on, and only the Armenians were\nbeing fought. If it were a world war or something like that, they would have\nbeen fighting everyone. But they only fought us. Then I met some women from \nour building, some Azerbaijanis. They are crying, they tell me, "Karina, we \nsaw all of it, how could it happen?" They're asking me! Well I just don't know\nwhat to call it if a normal girl can stand there and watch what happened to \nme. I think that if it were the other way around either I wouldn't have been \nable to take it, or I would have tried to avert it, like that one Azerbaijani \nwoman did in front of our building. A woman lives there, an awful, dissipated \nwoman, if you can call her a woman, the dissipated life she leads. Two \nArmenian families live there, in her part of the building. She came out on the\nbalcony and saw what was happening to me and started to scream and curse. She \ncame down to the entryway and said, "You'll come in this entryway over my dead\nbody." So not one of them took it in his head to go in that entryway. Some \nfolks were saying that those people were so out of control that they didn't \neven know what they were doing. I don't think that's true. They knew very well\nwhat they were doing if they didn't even lift a hand against that woman. They \ncouldn't have cared less about her, but the fact that she was an Azerbaijani \nstopped them.\n\nThey were just beasts, they had smoked so much. When they came to our place \nthey were all chewing something. I noticed: Everyone who came into the \napartment was chewing something. I think, my God, maybe I just think that? \nMaybe I'm losing my mind? But no, they're all chewing something. Maybe it is \nsome kind of drug, it must be, because . . . At first glance they all seemed \nto be such normal people, young, clean-shaven, looking exactly as if they had \ncome to some sort of celebration. But they were shouting something. They\ndidn't talk, they shouted, as though there were deaf people there. They \nscreamed and screamed: "Yeah, killing, killing, we're killing the Armenians!" \nOnly they didn't shout "kill," they shouted "gurun ermianlary." Gurun \nliterally means "kill," or "destroy."\n\nThat's how it was! I'll continue. We hid in a captain's apartment, he's an\nAzerbaijani, his wife is a Tatar. We were sitting in their apartment, their \nkids were out in the yard. Their kids knew a whole lot. This was in our part \nof the building, on the third floor. When Mamma came to and couldn't find\nLyuda she took Papa's hand, this was while the looters were stealing things,\nbut they didn't pay attention because they were stealing things. Apparently\nthey had already ceased killing and switched to stealing. Mamma found the\ncourage to . . .\n\nA boy said to my mother "Where's the gold?" Mamma said he must have been 12 \nto 14 years old. He even looked Russian, he was so fair-skinned. But the \nAzerbaijanis from Armenia are fair-skinned. I noticed they were all on the \nfair side. He shouted, they were all smashing things, and he asks Mamma where \nthe gold is. We kept our gold in the wardrobe with our important papers. In a \nlittle black bag, we kept everything in there. Mamma doesn't really like to \nwear gold. She probably never even wore those things from the time they were \nbought for her. They took everything that was lying on the cheval glass. Mamma\nthinks that the gold saved us. Because they threw themselves at the gold, and \nMamma grabbed Papa, who was trying to breathe. They had closed his mouth, \nbound his hands, and put a pillow and a chair on his face . . . They had \nshoved something into his mouth so he would suffocate. Mamma grabbed him and \ntore all that stuff off . . . He had something in his mouth, he was having \ntrouble breathing, his nose was filled with blood. Mamma grabbed him and \nstarted running from the fifth down to the first floor because no one wanted \nto open their doors to them. Mamma said that by accident, completely by \naccident that person opened his door, he was sleeping, and said, half-awake, \n"What's happened?" He sees that they are bloody. Mamma said, "At least go and \nfind out what's happening to my daughters, even if they've burned them or \nmurdered them, at least bring the corpses." He went looking for us. At that \nmoment Lyuda was under the bed. She says that after they left it seemed that \nsomeone was calling her name. When he quietly called her she couldn't get out \nfrom under the bed. She wanted to get out and was calling softly. She thought \nshe was shouting, but in fact she was either silent or was only talking to \nherself, it just seemed to her that she was shouting. When she got out from \nunder the bed everyone was gone. And again . . . She thought that she had lost\nher mind. I'll never leave here, never! To hell with it! It just seems that \nway to me, I'll come to eventually. But then, when everything had settled \ndown, stopped, that mall brought Lyuda down, and Igor carried me in from\noutside. Or first I was brought in, then Lyuda, I don't remember what order it\nhappened in.\n\nAnd Mamma said, "Listen, they're all running around down there, shouting \nsomething or other, and running toward the other building." It had more or \nless calmed down where we were. Who's dead, who's alive, we don't know. I \ntried to call my girlfriend. I had basically come to. Mamma says, "Listen;\nlet's go upstairs, at least get a mattress or something. We don't know how \nlong we'll be here. Maybe they didn't burn everything." I don't get it, all\nwomen have that feeling, they want to get something from their homes, maybe \nnot everything was taken? I tell Mamma, "Mamma, what do you need any of that \nfor? To hell with it! We're alive, forget the rest of it, all of it!" She\nsays, "No, let's go get at least something. Maybe we'll leave here, spend the \nnight at someone else's." Mamma went upstairs, and their little boy, their son\nAlik, was standing on the lookout. lIe was standing there to see if they were \ncoming. They only managed to run up there and grab something one time. He \nshouts, "Come back, they're coming!" They didn't have enough time to get a \nlot, mattresses from one apartment, a blanket from another . . . Mamma got my \nknitting . . . Someone managed to grab our old things, the ones we never wore,\nout of the hall . . . Someone took Father's old coveralls. The neighbor, his \nwife, Mamma and Papa . . . Marina went with them. I was in no condition to \nleave. Neither was Lyuda. We just sat. They ran out and we closed the door and\njust then we hear that the mob is on its way toward our place upstairs, \nthey're dragging something again. They were going toward the other building, \nmaybe over by the school, or . . . There was an unfinished building over\nthere, people said they were going toward the basement or the unfinished \nbuilding, they could gradually carry everything over there. Then things more \nor less calmed down. I tried to call my boss.\n\nLater there was more noise. We were on the third floor, in a one-bedroom\napartment, and a woman lives in the one-bedroom place on the second floor,\nAsya Dallakian. She's an old woman, retired. She wasn't at home, at that\ntime she was usually in the country, she has a married daughter there, and\nher grandson is in the army. She is only very rarely in town; she gets her\nretirement money and the apartment is essentially vacant. They started\npounding on her door and broke it down. She had two or three beds in there, \nsomething like that, she's a 60-to 70-year-old woman who really does not even \nlive there. Probably she had some pots, a couple of metal bed frames and \nmattresses, and a television. When her grandson came she bought a television. \nThey started wrecking everything. I started getting sick again. I think, "My \nGod, what is going on around here? When will this end?" We turned off the \nlights and sat. As it turns out the people who weren't afraid, the ones who \nknew what was going on, knew not to turn off the lights. We didn't know, but \nthey didn't come to where we were all the same. They all knew very well that \nhe was a captain. He went out and closed the door, and we sat in his \napartment. His last name was Kasumov. He's an exserviceman, retired, works up \nat the fire station at some plant or other. He went out and stood at his door.\nThey tell him, "Comrade Captain, don't worry, we won't harm you, you're one of\nus." He went upstairs, and they say, "Aren't you taking anything from this \napartment?" He says, "I don't need anything." And the women who were standing \nin the yard . . . we have a basement, full of water . . . the women who were \nstanding in the yard saw. Those guys, they left everything they stole on the \nfirst floor and ran upstairs again. The women threw everything they had time \nto into the basement, to save our property. Some things were left: dirty \npillows, two or three other things and a rug. A guy came downstairs, really \nmad, and he says, "Where's the rug? I just put it right here!" They tell him, \n"Some guy came and took it and went off toward the school." He ran off in that\ndirection.\n\nOh! I forgot the most important point. When Igor picked me up in his arms, \nthere were women standing there who saw everything that was going on. They \njust didn't tell me about it for a long time. The wife of that military man, \nshe didn't want to kill my spirit, I was already dead enough. Later she told \nme, that after they murdered Uncle Shurik in the third entryway one of them, \nthe ringleader, apparently a young man, said, "Where's the girl who was here?"\nAnd he became furious. The woman tells him, "She came to . . . " She didn't\nknow what to say: Think something up? Someone carried her off? Then they would\ncomb the whole house and find me and our whole family. So the woman says, "She\ncame to and went to the basement." Now, our basement is full of water. So the \nwhole mob dashes off to the basement to look for me or my corpse. They took \nflashlights; they were up to their waists in water, water which had been \nstanding there for years, and soot, and fuel oil. They climbed down in there \nto get me. Then one of them said, "There's so much water down there, she \nprobably walked and walked and then passed out and died. She met her death in \nthe basement. That's it, we can leave, no problem!" I didn't know that, and \nwhen I was told, I felt worse. Two times worse. A lot worse! So they didn't \njust want to pound me flat, something more awful was awaiting me . . .\n\nAfter that we of course didn't want to live in Sumgait any longer. We really \ndidn't want to go back to our apartment. When we moved, I went up there and \nstarted to quiver and shake all over, because I started remembering it all. \nAlthough the neighbors all sobbed, it was all . . . so cheap . . . The people \nwho sat in their apartments and didn't help us at a time like that. I think \nthat they could have helped! I don't think that they were obligated to, but \nthey could have helped us! Because that one woman was able to stop that whole \nbrutal crowd by herself. That means they could have, too. It would have been\nenough foe one man or women to say, What do you think you're doing?" That's \nall! That would have done it. There were 60 apartments in our building. Not \none person said it! When I was lying on the ground and all those people were \nstanding on their balconies I didn't hear anyone's voice, no one said what are\nyou doing, leave her alone . . . Mamma even told one of the neighbor women \nthat if it had been an Azerbaijani woman in my place they would have dropped a\nbomb if it would have killed even one Armenian. They would have stood up for \none of their own. True, they say that our neighbor from the fourth entryway, \nan old/ sick woman tried to stop the pogrom. The Azerbaijanis have a custom: \nif a woman takes her scarf and throws it on the ground, the men are supposed \nto stop immediately. The old woman from the fourth entryway did that, but they\nstomped her scarf into the ground, pushed her off to the side, and said, "If\nyou want to go on living, you'll disappear into your apartment." So she left.\nThat trick didn't work on them.\n\nEven the neighbors who helped us move told me, OK, fine, calm down, forget \nthat it happened. I said I'd only forget it if I told them right then that it\nhad happened to their daughter--and if that didn't have any effect on them, \nthen I would forget everything, too. Imagine that it happened to your sister. \nAnd no one did anything. Anything.\n\n   April 25, 1988\n   Yerevan\n\n			- - - reference - - -\n\n[1] _The Sumgait Tragedy; Pogroms against Armenians in Soviet Azerbaijan,\n    Volume I, Eyewitness Accounts_, edited by Samuel Shahmuradian, forward by\n    Yelena Bonner, 1990, published by Aristide D.

"Assuming"? Also: come on, Brad. If we are going to get anywhere in \nthis (or any) discussion, it doesn't help to bring up elements I never \naddressed, *nor commented on in any way*. I made no comment on who is \n"right" or who is "wrong", only that civilians ARE being used as cover \nand that, having been placed "in between" the Israelis and the guerillas,\nthey *will* be injured as both parties continue their fight.\n \n	[The *purpose* of an army's use of military uniforms \n	is *to set its members apart* from the civilians so that \n	civilians will not be thought of by the other side as\n	"combatants". So, what do you think is the "meaning behind", \n	the intention and the effect when an "army" purposely \n	*does not were uniforms but goes out of its way to *look \n	like civilians'? *They are judging that the benefit they will \n	receive from this "cover" is more important that the harm\n	that will come to civilians.*\n\nThis is a comment on the Israeli experience and is saying\nthat the guerillas *do* have some responsibility in putting civilians\nin "the middle" of this fight. By putting on uniforms and living apart\nfrom civilians (barracks, etc.), the guerillas would significantly lower\nthe risk to civilians.\n\n	But if the guerillas do this aren't *they* putting themselves\n	at greater risk? Absolutely, they ask themselves "why set \n	ourselves apart (by wearing uniforms) when there is a ready-made \n	cover for us (civilians)? That makes sense from their point of \n	view, BUT when this cover is used, the guerillas should accept \n	some of the responsibility for subsequent harm to civilians.\n\n\nI agree with you here. I have always thought that Israel's bombing\nsortees and bombing policy is stupid, thoughtless, inhumane AND\nineffective. BUT, there is no reason that Israel should passive wait \nuntil attackers chose to act; there is every reason to believe that\n"taking the fight *to* the enemy" will do more to stop attacks. \n\nAs I said previously, Israel spent several decades "sitting passively"\non its side of a border and only acting to stop these attacks *after*\nthe attackers had entered Israeli territory. It didn't work very well.\nThe "host" Arab state did little/nothing to try and stop these attacks \nfrom its side of the border with Israel so the number of attacks\nwere considerably higher, as was their physical and psychological impact \non the civilians caught in their path.  \n\nThis is just another "selectively applied" statement.\n \nThe reason for this drawn-out impasse between Ababs/Palestinians and Israelis\nis that NEITHER side is willing to accept the Word of the other. By your\ncriteria *everyone* should stay away from the negotiations.\n\nThat is precisely why the Palestinians (in their recent PISGA proposal for \nthe "interim" period after negotiations and leading up to full autonomy) are\ndemanding conditions that essentially define "autonomy" already. They DO\nNOT trust that Israel will "follow through" the entire process and allow\nPalestinians to reach full autonomy. \n\nDo you understand and accept this viewpoint by the Palestinians? \nIf you do, then why should Israel's view of Arabs/Palestinians \nbe any different? Why should they trust the Arab/Palestinians' words?\nSince they don't, they are VERY reluctant to give up "tangible assets \n(land, control of areas) in exchange for "words". For this reason,\nthey are also concerned about the sorts of "guarantees" they will have \nthat the Arabs WILL follow through on their part of any agreement reached.\n\nAbsolutely, so are the Arabs/Palestinians asking FIRST for the\nIsraelis "word" in relation to any agreement? NO, what is being\ndemanded FIRST is LAND. When the issue is LAND, and one party\nfinally gets HOLD of this "land", what the "other party" does\nis totally irrelevent. If I NOW have possession of this land,\nyour words have absolutely no power; whether Israel chooses to\nkeeps its word does NOT get the land back.\n\n\nWhile the "major armaments" (those allowing people to wage "civil wars")\nhave been removed, the weapons needed to cross-border attacks still\nremain to some extent. Rocket attacks still continue, and "commando"\nraids only require a few easily concealed weapons and a refined disregard\nfor human life (yours of that of others). Such attacks also continue.\n\n\nBat guano. The situation you call for existed in the 1970s and attacks\nwere commonplace.\n\n\nThere is NO WAY these groups can be effectively "disarmed" UNLESS the state\nis as authoritarian is Syria's. The only other way is for Lebanon to take\nit upon itself to constantly patrol the entire border with Israel, essentially\nmirroring Israel's border secirity on its side. It HAS TO PROVE TO ISREAL that\nit is this committed to protecting Israel from attack from Lebanese territory.\n\nThat's what I said, ok? But, doesn't that mean that Syria has to "take over"\nLebanon? I don't think Israel or Lebanon would like that.\nWhat both "sides" need is to receive something "tangible". The Arabs/\nPalestinians are looking for "land" and demanding that they receive it\nprior to giving anything to Israel. Israel has two problems: 1) if it\ngives up real *land* it IS exposing itself to a changed geostrategic\nsituation (and that change doesn't help Israel's position), and 2) WHEN\nit gives up this land IT NEEDS to receive something in return to\ncompensate for the increased risks

That is your Greek idea to\nsay Turks are bad people. We know who we are and proud to be TURKS\nanywhere in the world. That is not Greeks business to tell us what\nkind of people we are. You are not at position to judge people because\nyou are not civilized enough to give equal rights to your own minorities.\nMillions of minorities are being treated as third class citizen,\ntheir rights are taken away from them, and they have no voices under\nthe Government of Greece.

Some of your article was cut off on the right margin, but I will try\nand answer from what I can read.\n\nJudaism did not father Islam.  We had many of the same prophets, but\nJudaism ignores prophets later prophets including Jesus Christ (who\nChristians and Muslims believe in) and Mohammed.  The idea of believing\nin one God should unite all peoples.  However, note that Christianity\nand Islam reflect the fact that there are people with different views\nand the rights of non-Christians and non-Muslims are stated in each\nreligion.\n\n\nWe are supposed to pay 6% of our income after all necessities are\npaid.  Please note that this 6% is on a personal basis - if you are\npoor, there is no need to pay (quite the contrary, this money most\noften goes to the poor in each in country and to the poor Muslims\naround the world).  Also, this money is not required in the human\nsense (i.e. a Muslim never knocks at your door to ask for money\nand nobody makes a list at the mosque to make sure you have paid\n(and we surely don't pass money baskets around during our prayer\nservices)).\n\nGod's presence is certainly on Earth, but since God is everywhere,\nGod may show signs of existence in other places as well.  We can not\nsay for sure where God has shown signs of his existence and where\nhe has not/.\n\nThe Qur'an is not a copyright of the Taurah.  Muslims believe that\nthe Taurah, the Bible, and the Qur'an originally contained much the same\nmessage, thus the many similiarities.  However, the Taurah and the\nBible have been 'translated' into other languages which has changed\ntheir meaning over time (a translation also reflects some of the\npersonal views of the translator(s).  The Qur'an still exists in the\nsame language that it was revealed in - Arabic.  Therefore, we know\nthat mankind has not changed its meaning.  It is truly what was revealed\nto Mohammed at that time.  There are many scientific facts which\nwere not discovered by traditional scientific methods until much later\nsuch as the development of the baby in the mother's womb.\n\n\nOnly God knows for sure how it will turn out.  I hope it won't, but if\nthat happens, it was the will of God.\n\nPlease send this mail to me again so I can read the rest of what\nyou said.  And yes, may God help us all.
(Soner Yamen) responded to article <1r20kr$m9q@nic.umass.edu> BURAK@UCSVAX.\n\n[AFS]     Just a quick comment::\n[AFS]\n[AFS]     Armenians killed Turks------Turks killed Armenians.\n[AFS]\n[AFS]     Simple as that. Can anybody deny these facts?\n\nJews killed Germans in WWII -- Germans killed Jews in WWII, BUT there was \nquite a difference in these two statements, regardless of what Nazi \nrevisionists say!\n\n[SY] My grand parents were living partly in todays Armenia and partly in\n[SY] todays Georgia. There were villages, Kurd/Turk (different Turkic groups)\n[SY] Georgian (muslim/christian) Armenian and Farsi... Very near to eachother.\n[SY] The people living there were aware of their differences. They were \n[SY] different people. For example, my grandfather would not have been happy \n[SY] if his doughter had willed to marry an Armenian guy. But that did not \n[SY] mean that they were willing to kill eachother. No! They were neighbors.\n\nOK.\n\n[SY] Armenians killed Turks. Which Armenians? Their neoghbors? As far as my\n[SY] grandparents are concerned, the Armenians attacked first but these \n[SY] Armenians were not their neighbors. They came from other places. Maybe \n[SY] first they had a training at some place. They were taught to kill people,\n[SY] to hate Turks/Kurds? It seems so...\n\nThere is certainly a difference between the planned extermination of the\nArmenians of eastern Turkey beginning in 1915, with that of the Armeno-\nGeorgian conflicts of late 1918! The argument is not whether Armenians ever \nkilled in their collective existence, but rather the wholesale destruction of\nAnatolian Armenians under orders of the Turkish government. An Armenian-\nGeorgian dispute over the disposition of Akhalkalak, Lori, and Pambak after\nthe Turkish Third Army evacuated the region, cannot be equated with the\nextermination of Anatolian Armenians. Many Armenians and Georgians died\nin this area in the scramble to re-occupy these lands and the lack of\npreparation for the winter months. This is not the same as the Turkish \ngenocide of the Armenians nearly four years earlier, hundreds of kilometers\naway!\n\n[SY] Anyway, but after they killed/raped/... Turks and other muslim people\n[SY] around, people assumed that 'Armenians killed us, raped our women',\n[SY] not a particular group of people trained in some camps, maybe backed\n[SY] by some powerful states... After that step, you cannot explain these \n[SY] people not to hate all Armenians. \n\nI don't follow, perhaps the next paragraph will shed some light.\n\n[SY] So what am I trying to point out? First, at least for that region,\n[SY] you cannot blame Turks/Kurds etc since it was a self defense situation.\n[SY] Most of the Armenians, I think, are not to blame either. But since some\n[SY] people started that fire, it is not easy to undo it. There are facts.\n[SY] People cannot trust eachother easily. It is very difficult to establish\n[SY] a good relation based on mutual respect and trust between nations with\n[SY] different ethnic/cultural/religious backgrounds but it is unfortunately\n[SY] very easy to start a fire!\n\nAgain, the fighting between Armenians and Georgians in 1918/19 had little to\ndo with the destruction of the Armenians in Turkey. It is interesting that\nthe Georgian leaders of the Transcaucasian Federation (Armenia, Azerbaijan, \nand Georgia) made special deals with Turkish generals not to pass through \nTiflis on their way to Baku, in return for Georgians not helping the Armenians \nmilitarily. Of course, as Turkish troops marched across what was left of\nCaucasian Armenia, many Armenians went north and such population movement \ncaused problems with the locals. This is in no comparison with events 4 years \nearlier in eastern Anatolia. My father's mother's family escaped Cemiskezek -> \nErzinka -> Erzerum -> Nakhitchevan -> Tiflis -> Constantinople -> \nMassachusetts. \n\n[SY] My grandparents were *not* bloodthirsty people. We did not experience\n[SY] what they had to endure... They had to leave their lands, there were\n[SY] ladies, old ladies, all of her children killed while she forced to\n[SY] witness! Young women put dirt at their face to make themselves\n[SY] unattractive! I don't want to go into any graphic detail.\n\nMy grandmother's brother was forced to dress up as a Kurdish women, and paste\npotato skins on his face to look ugly. The Turks would kill any Armenian\nyoung man on sight in Dersim. Because their family was rather influential,\nlocal Kurds helped them escape before it was too late. This is why I am alive \ntoday.\n\n[SY] You may think that my sources are biased. They were biased in some sense.\n[SY] They experienced their own pain, of course. That is the way it is.  But\n[SY] as I said they were living in peace with their neighbors before. Why \n[SY] should they become enemies?
[It looks like Yigal has been busy...]\n\nRTw  04/14 2155  JEWISH GROUP SUED FOR PASSING OFFICIAL INFORMATION\n\n    By Adrian Croft\n     SAN FRANCISCO, April 14, Reuter - Nineteen people, including the son of\nformer Israeli Defence Minister Moshe Arens, sued the Anti-Defamation League\n(ADL) on Wednesday, accusing the Jewish group of disclosing confidential\nofficial information about them.\n     Richard Hirschhaut, director of the San Francisco branch of the ADL, art\ndealer Roy Bullock and former policeman Tom Gerard were also named as defendants\nin the suit, filed in San Francisco County Superior Court.\n     The 19 accuse the ADL of B'nai B'rith, a group dedicated to fighting\nanti-Semitism, and the other defendants of secretly gathering information on\nthem, including data from state and federal agencies.\n     The suit alleges they disclosed the information to others, including the\ngovernments of Israel and South Africa, in what it alleges was a "a massive\nspying operation."\n     The action is a class-action suit. It was filed on behalf of about 12,000\nanti-apartheid activists or opponents of Israeli policies about whom the\nplaintiffs believe the ADL, Bullock and Gerard gathered information.\n     Representatives of the ADL in San Francisco were not immediately available\nfor comment on Wednesday.\n     The civil suit is the first legal action arising out of allegations that\nGerard, a former inspector in the San Francisco police intelligence unit, passed\nconfidential police files on California political activists to a spy ring.\n     The FBI and San Francisco police are investigating the ADL, Bullock and\nGerard over the affair and last week searched the ADL's offices in San Francisco\nand Los Angeles.\n     The suit alleges invasion of privacy under the Civil Code of California,\nwhich prohibits the publication of information obtained from official sources.\nIt seeks exemplary damages of at least $2,500 per person as well as other\nunspecified damages.\n     Lawyer Pete McCloskey, a former Congresmen who is representing the\nplaintiffs, said the 19 plaintiffs included Arab-Americans and Jews -- and his\nwife Helen, who also had information gathered about her.\n     One of the plaintiffs is Yigal Arens, a research scientist at the\nUniversity of Southern California who is a son of the former Israeli Defence\nMinister.\n     Arens told the San Francisco Examiner he had seen a file the ADL kept on\nhim in the 1980s, presumably because of his criticism of the treatment of\nPalestinians and his position on the Israeli-occupied territories.\n     According to court documents released last week, Bullock and Gerard both\nkept information on thousands of California political activists.\n     In the documents, a police investigator said he believed the ADL paid\nBullock for many years to provide information and that both the league and\nBullock received confidential information from the authorities.\n     No criminal charges have yet been filed in the case. The ADL, Bullock and\nGerard have all denied any wrongdoing.\n  REUTER AC KG CM\n\n\n\nAPn  04/14 2202  ADL Lawsuit\n\nCopyright, 1993. The Associated Press. All rights reserved.\n\nBy CATALINA ORTIZ\n Associated Press Writer\n   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Arab-Americans and critics of Israel sued the\nAnti-Defamation League on Wednesday, saying it invaded their privacy by\nillegally gathering information about them through a nationwide spy network.\n   The ADL, a national group dedicated to fighting anti-Semitism, intended to\nuse the data to discredit them because of their political views, according to\nthe class-action lawsuit filed in San Francisco Superior Court.\n   "None of us has been guilty of racism or Nazism or anti-Semitism or hate\ncrimes, or any of the other `isms' that the ADL claims to protect against. None\nof us is violent or criminal in any way," said Carol El-Shaieb, an education\nconsultant who develops programs on Arab culture.\n   The 19 plaintiffs include Yigal Arens, son of former Israel Defense Minister\nMoshe Arens. The younger Arens, a research scientist at the University of\nSouthern California, said the ADL kept a file on him in the 1980s presumably\nbecause he has criticized Israel's treatment of Palestinians.\n   "The ADL believes that anyone who is an Arab American ... or speaks\npolitically against Israel is at least a closet anti-Semite," Arens said.\n   The ADL has denied any wrongdoing, but couldn't comment on the lawsuit\nbecause it hasn't reviewed it, said a spokesman at the ADL's New York\nheadquarters.\n   The FBI and local police and prosecutors are investigating allegations that\nthe ADL spied on thousands of individuals and hundreds of groups, including\nwhite supremacist and anti-Semitic organizations, Arab-Americans, Greenpeace,\nthe National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and San Francisco\npublic television station KQED.\n   Some information allegedly came from confidential police and government\nrecords, according to court documents filed in the probe and the civil lawsuit.\nNo charges have been filed in the criminal investigation.\n   The lawsuit accuses the ADL of violating California's privacy law, which\nforbids the intentional disclosure of personal information "not otherwise\npublic" from state or federal records.\n   The lawsuit claims the ADL disclosed the information to "persons and\nentities" who had no compelling need to receive it. It didn't elaborate.\n   Defendants include Richard Hirschhaut, director of the ADL's office in San\nFrancisco. He did not immediately return a phone call seeking comment.\n   Other defendants are San Francisco art dealer Roy Bullock, an alleged ADL\ninformant over the past four decades, and former police officer Tom Gerard.\nGerard allegedly tapped into law enforcement and government computers and passed\ninformation on to Bullock.\n   Gerard, who has retired from the police force, has moved to the Philippines.\nBullock's lawyer, Richard Breakstone, said he could not comment on the lawsuit\nbecause he had not yet studied it.\n\n\n\n\n\nUPwe 04/14 1956  ADL sued for allegedly spying on U.S. residents
henrik]  My response to the "shooting down" of a Turkish airplane over the \nhenrik]  Armenian air space was because of the IGNORANT posting of the \nhenrik]  person from your Country.

However, \n    I am sure YOU GUYS would have NEVER brought up ARMENIA's involvement if \n    KARABAKHI-Armenians had had HEAVY losses.\n\n\nDA] You might wish to read more about whether or not it is Azeri aggression\nDA] only in that region.  It seems to me that the Armenians are better\nDA] organized, have more success militarily and shell Azeri towns\nDA] repeatedly.  \n\n	Read what ? The New York Times , that is publishing anti-armenian\n	articles. Nop, I have my resources. Look, everyone knows how aggressive\n        Turks/Azeris have been in the past.

Go ahead , REPEAT as \n	much as you want. \n\nDA] I don't wish to get into the Cyprus discussion.  Turkey had the right to\nDA] intervene, and it did.  Perhaps the intervention was not supposed to\nDA] last for so long, but the constant refusal of the Greek governments both\nDA] on the island and in Greece to deal with reality is also to be blamed\nDA] for the ongoing standoff in the region.  \n\n	Not a chance !

I vote yes for it.\nDA] After all, it is now free.
Seems that you're more "just misinformed" than "just wondering."\n\nThe comparison you're making is not just totally off base, but\noffensive to all sane people.
What did you have to go and bring THAT up for?  Now they're going to\nsay that Israel is stealing the RAIN, too....
Of course it is!  \n\n\nAnd this is your opinion.  It is not any more valid due to repeated\ncapital letters and words such as 'untrue' 'never' etc.  \n\n\nSo Armenians are justified in aggression since supposedly Turks have\nbeen aggressive in the past?  I don't follow your logic.  \n\n\nI have said that I don't wish to get into Cyprus discussion and did not\ngive any reasons for Turkey's involvement.  I also am not trying to\nconvince you of anything, seeing no reason to waste any time.... \n\n\nI am serious.  Let's get soc.culture.armenia started and have some peace\nof mind?

This would be a reversal of the 1948 situation in which the Jews in\n   Palestine took control of the land and its (mostly Muslim) inhabitants.\n\n   However, whoever committed crimes against humanity (torture, blowing up their\n   homes, murders,...) must be treated and tried as a war criminal. The political\n   thought of these movements shows that a freedom of choice will be given to the\n   Jews in living under the new law or leaving to the destintion of their choice.\n\n   As for the PLO, I am at a loss to explain what is going inside Arafat's mind.\n\n   Although their political thinking seems far fetched with Israel acting as a true\n   super-power in the region, the Islamic movements are using the same weapon the\n   Jews used to establish their state : Religion.\n\n\n   Ahmed.\n\nForget the syntax, Ahmed, and focus on the semnatics. The fact is that\nthe PLO does not recognize Israel's right to exist. This is perfectly\nobvious from the PLO covenant (Cairo, 1968). The covenant calls for\nthe destruction of the "Zionist entity". As far as I know the\nIsrael-destruction clauses still exist in the document which specifies\nthe purpose for the existence of the PLO. If you would like, I can\npost the relevant caluses.\n\nNow the Hamas ideal is far more radical, it seems. I know it has been\nposted here several times, and while I do not have a copy of it, I am\nsure that someone does and he (or she, of course) would be more than\nhappy to repost it.\n\nRegardless of phrasing, groups like Hamas, and the Hezbollah, and\neven the newly moderate and politically-correct PLO, have at the very\nheart of their ideologies the need for the destrcution of Israel.\n\nIt just seems to me that Mr. Davidsson's suggestion that Jews support\npeople envolved in these organizations is not a particularly appealing\none to many Jews.
Well, your Armenian grandparents were fascist. As early as 1934, K. S. \nPapazian asserted in 'Patriotism Perverted' that the Armenians\n\n        'lean toward Fascism and Hitlerism.'[1]\n\nAt that time, he could not have foreseen that the Armenians would\nactively assume a pro-German stance and even collaborate in World\nWar II. His book was dealing with the Armenian genocide of Turkish\npopulation of eastern Anatolia. However, extreme rightwing ideological\ntendencies could be observed within the Dashnagtzoutune long before\nthe outbreak of the Second World War.\n\nIn 1936, for example, O. Zarmooni of the 'Tzeghagrons' was quoted\nin the 'Hairenik Weekly:' \n\n"The race is force: it is treasure. If we follow history we shall \n see that races, due to their innate force, have created the nations\n and these have been secure only insofar as they have reverted to\n the race after becoming a nation. Today Germany and Italy are\n strong because as nations they live and breath in terms of race.\n On the other hand, Russia is comparatively weak because she is\n bereft of social sanctities."[2]\n\n[1] K. S. Papazian, 'Patriotism Perverted,' (Boston, Baikar Press\n   1934), Preface.\n[2] 'Hairenik Weekly,' Friday, April 10, 1936, 'The Race is our\n   Refuge' by O. Zarmooni.\n\n\nSerdar Argic

A number of points.  You are making assumptions about the manner\nin which the cards are used.  True, by law, all residents, citizens,\nand tourists must carry a form of identification with them.

This takes place\nin banks (cashing checks), post offices (registered mail and such), etc...\nQuite frankly, it was rare that I ever had to present my ID card\nfor such activities more than once per week.  There is no law or\nrequirement that forces people to wave their ID cards in public.\nFurthermore, none of the services I outlined discriminate against\nthe bearer in any manner by having access to this information.\n\nThe only case that I can think of in which the Le'um field might\nbe taken into account is during interaction with the police,\nbased upon the scenario.  In general though, arab citizens are\nclearly recognizable, as are non-arabs. Your argument therefore\nbecomes moot unless you can provide an example of how this field\nis being used to discriminate against them officially.\n\n\n\nI take issue with your assertions.  I think that Arab countries\ndo know that they have nothing to fear from "Israeli expansionism".\nMilitarily, Israel is not capable of holding onto large tracts of\nland under occupation to a hostile, armed, and insurgent population for a\nsustained period of time.  As is, the intifada is heavily taxing\nthe Israeli economy.  Proof of this can be seen in the Israeli\nwithdrawal from Lebanon.  Israeli troops pulled back from the\nAwali, and later from the Litani, in order to control the minimal\nstrip needed to keep towns out of range of Katyusha missile fire.\nPublic opinion in Israel has turned towards settling the intifada\nvia territorial concessions.  The Israel public is sufferring from\nbattle fatigue of sorts and the gov't is aware of it.\n\nWith regards to borders, let me state the following.  I may not agree\nwith the manner in which negotiations are being held, however the crux\nof the matter is that everyone either makes or refrains from stating\na starting position.  The arab parties have called for total withdrawal\nand a return to pre-48 borders.  If Israel were to state large borders,\nthe negotiations might never get under way.  If Israel were to state\nsmaller borders, then the arab countries might try and force even smaller\nborders during the negotiations.  I think that leaving the matter to be\nsettled by negotiations and peace treaties is infinitely more realistic\nand sensible.\n\n\nYour statement is typical of the simple minded naivety of a "center for\npolicy research".  Whether or not all of Vanunu's revelations were true has no\nbearing on the fact that some were.  For disclosing "state secrets"\nafter having signed contracts and forms with the understanding that\nsaid secrets are not to be made public, one should be punished.\nAs to which were and which weren't, I am under no moral obligation\nto disclose that - quite the reverse in fact.\nHe was taken to court, tried, and found guilty.  You may take issue\nwith a number of things but clearly you have no understanding of the\nconcept of "Secrets of state", something which every democratic govt\nhas.\n\n\nI noticed that he was documenting the fact that such prisoners could exist\nmore than he documented the fact that they do exist.  The CLU noted,\nwhich you evidently did not pay attention to, that they know of no such\nreports or cases.  I am sorry to tell you but in a country of 4 mill,\nas tightly knit as Israel, even if the matter of the arrest was not\nmade public, within a relatively short time frame, most people would know\nabout it.  My own feelings are that the matter of the arrest should be\nmade public unless a court order is issued allowing a delay of X hours.\nThis would be granted only if a judge could be convinced that an\nannouncement would cause irreparable harm to the ongoing investigation.\n\n\nWell, I am sorry to say that your questions are slanted.  Such\nquestions are often termed "tabloid journalism" and are not\ndisturbing because they avoid any attempt at objectivity.\nSuch questions were often used during the McCarthy era as\na basis for the witch-hunts that took place then.  To use\nyour own example, these questions might have been lifted\nfrom the format used by Stalinist prosecutors that were looking\nfor small bits of evidence that they could distort and portray\nas a larger and dirtier picture.\n\nMy answers were not any more "hysterical" than the questions\nthemselves.  The problem is not that the q's were provocative,\nit was that they were selective in their fact seeking.  You\nfall into the same category of those who seek "yes" "no" answers\nwhen the real answer is "of sorts".\nI suspect that as long as the answers to these questions is not an\nunequivocal NO, you would remain unsatified and choose to interprete\nthem as you see fit.  A sign of strength is the ability to look\nYou remind me of those mistaken environmentalists who once advocated\nculling wolves because of the cruelty to deer, only to find that they\nhad broken the food chain and wreaked havoc upon the very environment\nthey sought to protect.  The color blindness you exhibit is a true\nsign of weakness.\n\n\nDitto.
Gee, I'd better tell this to the Mental Health Branch of the Israeli Army\nMedical Corps ! Where would we be without  you, Davidson ?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSigh.\n\nFour (4) deer in Tel Aviv ?? Well, this is probably as accurate as the rest of\nthis fantasy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYisrael Shahak the crackpot chemist ?  Figures.  I often see him in the\nRechavia (Jerusalem) post office. A really sad figure. Actually, I  feel sorry\nfor him. He was in a concentration camp during the Holocaust  and it must have\naffected him deeply.
[most of Brads post deleted.]\n\n\n	Tell me, do these young men also attack Syrian troops?\n\n\n\n	There must be a guarantee of peace before this happens.  It\nseems that many of these Lebanese youth are unable to restrain\nthemselves from violence, and unable to to realize that their actions\nprolong Israels stay in South Lebanon.\n\n	If the Lebanese army was able to maintain the peace, then\nIsrael would not have to be there.  Until it is, Israel prefers that\nits soldiers die rather than its children.\n\n\n\n	Israel should withdraw from Lebanon when a peace treaty is\nsigned.  Not a day before.  Withdraw because of casualties would tell\nthe Lebanese people that all they need to do to push Israel around is\nkill a few soldiers.  Its not gonna happen.\n\n\n\n	Why should Israel not demand this while holding the buffer\nzone?  It seems to me that the better bargaining position is while\nholding your neighbors land.  If Lebanon were willing to agree to\nthose conditions, Israel would quite probably have left already.\nUnfortunately, it doesn't seem that the Lebanese can disarm the\nHizbolah, and maintain the peace.\n\nAdam\nAdam Shostack 				       adam@das.harvard.edu
The scenario and genocide staged by the Armenians 78 years ago in \nx-Soviet Armenia is being reenacted again - this time in Azerbaijan. \n\nThe stories of survivors of Karabag massacre are in 'Milliyet' today.\n\n69 year old Hatin Nine telling:\n\n-''My Twin grandchildren were cut to pieces in front of my eyes. They told\nme: We won't kill you. But the babies have to die in front of your eyes.''\n\n72 year old Huseyin Ibrahimoglu:\n\n- ''Our Turkish village in Khojalu Town was blown up in two hours.\n  Turks, you must die.''\n\n28 year old Gulsum Huseyin:\n\n- ''They bayonetted my 3 year old daughter in her stomach in front of\n    my eyes.''\n\nAre these stories lies? Have the eye-witnesses been day-dreaming?\nWere these stories forged by Turkish journalists in the region?\n\nThe nonsense of such a claim is clear from the writings of British\nJournalists, too. Two days before we had quoted from a Sunday Times\narticle. They[British] reported the events in Karabag even before\nTurkish journalists. What is more here are the pictures. Pictures\nof people who were bayonetted, whose eyes were gouged, ears cut off.\n\nEven the Armenian Radio couldn't claim these "lies." They are saying\n"exaggeration." That means ''somethings'' have happened but the\nsituation is not as bad as reported. Perhaps that village of Khojalu\ntown was destroyed in 4 hours, instead of 2... Or Gulsum Huseyin's\n3 year old daughter was bayonetted in her chest instead of stomach...\n\nThe massacre is clearly seen with all its dimensions. The effects of\nthis massacre on Karabag and environs cannot be reduced by any word.\n\nSome of the western press', led by some French Newspapers, ability\nto ''close their eyes'' is nothing but complicity in this massacre.\n\nYesterday we gave samples from Le Figaro. Until yesterday's print\nno news about the real events in Karabag were printed. So were the\nFrench TV channels.. The subject they considered related to Karabag\nwas ''The necessity of protecting Armenians against Azeri attacks.''\n\nThe age we are living in is termed a human rights age. There are lots\nof organizations such as United Nations and CSCE(Conference on Security\nand Cooperation in Europe), and rules, all designed to fight against human\nrights violations. International reactions must be made with international\ncooperation. With support of everybody and every organization claiming\nto be civilized.\n\nCould there be a more serious human rights violation than that of the\nright to live -and with such levels of barbarity and cruelty-? Where\nis the cooperation? Where are the reactions? And the intellectuals,\njournalists, writers, TV stations of certain western countries such\nas France who are fast to claim leadership of "human rights?"\nWhere are you?\n\n\nSerdar Argic
I was trying to avoid a discussion of the whether Clintons views\nshould be endorsed or not.  All I was trying to find out was \nwhether the newspaper article was correct in making these\nstatements about the President by obtaining some information\nabout when and where he made these statements.\n\nThank you.
...quickly followed by...\n\n\nThis is the standard method for claiming non-combatant status, even\nfor the commanders of combat.\n\n\n"Innocent civilians"???  Like the ones who set up the booby traps or\nengaged in shoot-outs with soldiers or attack them with grenades or\naxes? \n\n\nAnd the rest of the world is getting used to Arab tactics of claiming\ninnocence for even the most guilty of the vile murderers among them.\nKeep it up long enough and it will backfire but good.
As usual, when Salah is not totally racist, she manages to get\nvirtually all the facts wrong.\n\nAssad pledged to allow Jews to leave Syria, but not to go to Israel.\n\nUnfortunately, not all of them have escaped yet, but not because they\ndon't want to leave;  rather, Assad went back on his word and stopped\nissuing travel permits.  He claimed bureaucratic snags, but everyone\nknows it was a tactic to pressure Israel.
Where the hell do you get off calling it "Arab land"?  Jews have been\nliving there for a long time.  Jews didn't just start arriving in 1900,\nthey've been living there for thousands of years, except for periods when\nthey were expelled but they always returned home.\n\n   Steve\n--

What \nwas he killed for. He hadn't hurt anyone, hadn't said any word he oughtn't \nhave. Why did they kill him? I want to find out--from here, from there, from \nthe government--why my husband was killed.\n\nOn the 27th, when I returned from work--it was a Saturday--my son was at home.\nHe doesn't work. I went straight to the kitchen, and he called me, "Mamma, is \nthere a soccer game?" There were shouts from Lenin Street. That's where we \nlived. I say, "I don't know, Igor, I haven't turned on the TV." He looked \nagain and said, "Mamma, what's going on in the courtyard?!" I look and see so \nmany people, it's awful, marching, marching, there are hundreds, thousands, \nyou can't even tell how many there are. They're shouting, "Down with the \nArmenians! Kill the Armenians! Tear the Armenians to pieces!" My God, why is \nthat happening, what for? I had known nothing at that point. We lived together\nwell, in friendship, and suddenly something like this. It was completely \nunexpected. And they were shouting, "Long live Turkey!" And they had flags,\nand they were shouting. There was a man walking in front well dressed, he's \naround 40 or 45, in a gray raincoat. He is walking and saying something, I \ncan't make it out through the vent window. He is walking and saying something,\nand the children behind him are shouting, "Tear the Armenians to pieces!" and \n"Down with the Armenians!" They shout it again, and then shout, "Hurrah!" The \npeople streamed without end, they were walking in groups, and in the groups I \nsaw that there were women, too. I say, "My God, there are women there too!" \nAnd my son says, "Those aren't women, Mamma, those are bad women." Well we \ndidn't look a long time. They were walking and shouting and I was afraid, I \nsimply couldn't sit still. I went out onto the balcony, and my Azerbaijani \nneighbor is on the other balcony, and I say, "Khalida, what's going on, what \nhappened?" She says, "Emma, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know what \nhappened." Well she was quite frightened too. They had these white sticks, \neach second or third one had a white rod. They're waving the rods above their \nheads as they walk, and the one who's out front, like a leader, he has a white\nstick too. Well maybe it was an armature shaft, but what I saw was white, I \ndon't know.\n\nMy husband got home 10 or 15 minutes later. He comes home and I say, "Oh \ndear, I'm frightened, they're going to kill us I bet." And he says, "What are \nyou afraid of, they're just children." I say, "Everything that happens comes \nfrom children." There had been 15- and 16-year kids from the Technical and \nVocational School. "Don't fear," he said, "it's nothing, nothing all that \nbad." He didn't eat, he just lay on the sofa. And just then on television they\nbroadcast that two Azerbaijanis had been killed in Karabakh, near Askeran. \nWhen I heard that I couldn't settle down at all, I kept walking here and \nthere and I said, "They're going to kill us, the Azerbaijanis are going to \nkill us." And he says, "Don't be afraid." Then we heard--from the central \nsquare, there are women shouting near near the stage, well, they're shouting\ndifferent things, and you couldn't hear every well. I say, "You speak\nAzerbaijani well, listen to what they're saying." He says "Close the window\nand go to bed, there s nothing happening there." He listened a bit and then \nclosed the window and went to bed, and told us, "Come on, go to sleep, it's\nnothing." Sleep, what did he mean sleep?  My Son and I stood at the window\nuntil two in the morning watching. Well he's sick, and all of this was\naffecting him. I say, "Igor, you go to bed, I'm going to go to bed in a minute\ntoo." He went and I sat at the window until three, and then went to bed. \nThings had calmed down slightly.\n\nThe 28th, Sunday, was my day off. My husband got up and said, "Come on, Emma, \nget up." I say, "Today's my day off, let me rest." He says, "Aren't you going \nto make me some tea?" Well I felt startled and got up, and said, "Where are \nyou going?" He says, "I'm going out, I have to." I say, "Can you really go \noutside on a day like today? Don't go out, for God's sake. You never listen to\nme, I know, and you're not going to listen to me now, but at least don't take \nthe car out of the garage, go without the car." And he says, "Come on, close \nthe door!" And then on the staircase he muttered something, I couldn't make it\nout, he probably said "coward" or something.\n\nI closed the door and he left. And I started cleaning . . . picking things up\naround the house . . . Everything seemed quiet until one o'clock in the after-\nnoon, but at the bus station, my neighbor told me, cars were burning. I said,\n"Khalida, was it our car?" She says, "No, no, Emma, don't be afraid, they\nwere government cars and Zhigulis.'' Our car is a GAZ-21 Volga. And I waited,\nit was four o'clock, five o'clock . . . and when he wasn't home at seven I\nsaid, "Oh, they've killed Shagen!"\n\nTires are burning in town, there's black smoke in town, and I'm afraid, I'm \nstanding on the balcony and I'm all . . . my whole body is shaking. My God, \nthey've probably killed him! So basically I waited like that until ten \no'clock and he still hadn't come home. And I'm afraid to go out. At ten\no'clock I look out: across from our building is a building with a bookstore,\nand from upstairs, from the second floor, everything is being thrown outside. \nI'm looking out of one window and Igor is looking out of the other, and I \ndon't want him to see this, and he, as it turns out, doesn't want me to see \nit. We wanted to hide it from one another. I joined him. "Mamma," he says,\n"look what they're doing over there!" They were burning everything, and there \nwere police standing there, 10 or 15 of them, maybe twenty policemen standing \non the side, and the crowd is on the other side, and two or three people are \nthrowing everything down from the balcony. And one of the ones on the balcony \nis shouting, "What are you standing there for, burn it!" When they threw the \ntelevision, wow, it was like a bomb! Our neighbor on the third floor came out \non her balcony and shouted, "Why are you doing that, why are you burning those\nthings, those people saved with such difficulty to buy those things for their \nhome. Why are you burning them?" And from the courtyard they yell at her, "Go \ninside, go inside! Instead why don't you tell us if they are any of them in \nyour building or not?" They meant Armenians, but they didn't say Armenians, \nthey said, "of them." She says, "No, no, no, none!" Then she ran downstairs to\nour place, and says, "Emma, Emma, you have to leave!" I say, "They've killed\nShagen anyway, what do we have to live for? It won't be living for me without \nShagen. Let them kill us, too!" She insists, saying, "Emma, get out of here, \ngo to Khalida's, and give me the key. When they come I'll say that it's my \ndaughter's apartment, that they're off visiting someone." I gave her the key \nand went to the neighbor's, but I couldn't endure it. I say, "Igor, you stay \nhere, I'm going to go downstairs, and see, maybe Papa's . . . Papa's there."\n\nMeanwhile, they were killing the two brothers, Alik and Valery [Albert and \nValery Avanesians; see the accounts of Rima Avanesian and Alvina Baluian], in \nthe courtyard. There is a crowd near the building, they're shouting, howling, \nand I didn't think that they were killing at the time. Alik and Valery lived\nin the corner house across from ours. When I went out into the courtyard I saw\nan Azerbaijani, our neighbor, a young man about 30 years old. I say, "Madar, \nUncle Shagen's gone, let's go see, maybe he's dead in the garage or near the \ngarage, let's at least bring the corpse into the house. "He shouts, "Aunt \nEmma, where do you think you're going?! Go back into the house, I'll look for \nhim." I say, "Something will happen to you, too, because of me, no, Madar, \nI'm coming too." Well he wouldn't let me go all the same, he says, "You stay \nhere with us, I'm go look." He went and looked, and came back and said, "Aunt \nEmma, there's no one there, the garage is closed. "Madar went off again and \nthen returned and said, "Aunt Emma, they're already killed Alik, and Valery's \nthere . . . wheezing."\n\nMadar wanted to go up to him, but those scoundrels said, "Don't go near him, \nor we'll put you next to him." He got scared--he's young--and came back and \nsaid, "I'm going to go call, maybe an ambulance will come, at least to take \nAlik, maybe he'll live . . . " They grew up together in our courtyard, they \nknew each other well, they had always been on good terms. He went to call, but\nnot a single telephone worked, they had all been shut off. He called, and \ncalled, and called, and called--nothing.\n\nI went upstairs to the neighbor's. Igor says, "Two police cars drove up over \nthere, their headlights are on, but they're not touching them, they are still \nlying where they were, they're still lying there . . . "We watched out the\nwindow until four o'clock, and then went downstairs to our apartment. I didn't\ntake my clothes off. I lay on the couch so as not to go to bed, and at six\no'clock in the morning I got up and said, "Igor, you stay here at home, don't\ngo out, don't go anywhere, I'm going to look, I have to find Papa, dead or\nalive . . . let me go . . . I've got the keys from work."\n\nAt six o'clock I went to the Emergency Hospital. The head doctor and another \ndoctor opened the door to the morgue. I run up to them and say, "Doctor, is \nShagen there?" He says, "What do you mean? Why should Shagen be here?!" I \nwanted to go in, but he wouldn't let me. There were only four people in there,\nthey said. Well, they must have been awful because they didn't let me in. They\nsaid, "Shagen's not here, he's alive somewhere, he'll come back."\n\nIt's already seven o'clock in the morning. I look and there is a panel truck\nwith three policemen. Some of our people from the hospital were there with\nthem. I say, "Sara Baji ["Sister" Sara, term of endearment], go look, they've\nprobably brought Shagen." I said it, shouted it, and she went and came back\nand says, "No, Emma, he has tan shoes on, it's a younger person." Now Shagen \njust happened to have tan shoes, light tan, they were already old. When they \nsaid it like that I guessed immediately. I went and said, "Doctor, they've \nbrought Shagen in dead." He says, "Why are you carrying on like that, dead, \ndead . . . he's alive." But then he went all the same, and when he came back \nthe look on his face was . . . I could tell immediately that he was dead. They\nknew one another well, Shagen had worked for him a long time. I say, "Doctor, \nis it Shagen?" He says, "No, Emma, it's not he, it's somebody else entirely." \nI say, "Doctor, why are you deceiving me, I'll find out all the same anyway, \nif not today, then tomorrow." And he said . . . I screamed, right there in the\noffice. He says, "Emma, go, go calm down a little." Another one of our \ncolleagues said that the doctor had said it was Shagen, but . . . in hideous \ncondition. They tried to calm me down, saying it wasn't Shagen. A few minutes \nlater another colleague comes in and says, "Oh, poor Emma!" When she said it \nlike that there was no hope left.\n\n   That day was awful. They were endlessly bringing in dead and injured \npeople.\n\nAt night someone took me home. I said, "Igor, Papa's been killed."\n\nOn the morning of the 1st I left Igor at home again and went to the hospital: \nI had to bury him somehow, do something. I look and see that the hospital is \nsurrounded by soldiers. They are wearing dark clothes. "Hey, citizen, where \nare you going?" I say, "I work here," and from inside someone shouts, "Yes, \nyes, that's our cook, let her in." I went right to the head doctor's office\nand there is a person from the City Health Department there, he used to\nwork with us at the hospital. He says, "Emma, Shagen's been taken to Baku.\nIn the night they took the wounded and the dead, all of them, to Baku." I\nsay, "Doctor, how will I bury him?" He says, "We're taking care of all that,\ndon't you worry, we'll do everything, we'll tell you about it. Where did you\nspend the night?" I say, "I was at home." He says, "What do you mean you\nwere at home?! You were at home alone?" I say, "No, Igor was there too." He\nsays, "You can't stay home, we're getting an ambulance right now, wait just\none second, the head doctor is coming, we're arranging an ambulance right\nnow, you put on a lab coat and take one for Igor, you go and bring Igor here\nlike a patient, and you'll stay here and we'll se~ later what to do next ..."\nHis last name is Kagramanov. The head doctor's name is Izyat Jamalogli\nSadukhov.\n\nThe "ambulance" arrived and I went home and got Igor. They admitted him as a \npatient, they gave us a private room, an isolation room. We stayed in the \nhospital until the 4th.\n\nSome police car came and they said, "Emma, let's go." And the women, our \ncolleagues, then they saw the police car, became anxious and said, "Where are \nyou taking her?" I say, "They're going to kill me, too . . . " And the\ninvestigator says, "Why are you saying that, we're going to make a positive\nidentification." We went to Baku and they took me into the morgue . . . I\nstill can't remember what hospital it was . . . The investigator says, "Let's \ngo, we need to be certain, maybe it's not Shagen." And when I saw the caskets,\nlying on top of one another, I went out of my mind. I say, "I can't look, no."\nThe investigator says, "Are there any identifying marks?" I say, "Let me see\nthe clothes, or the shoes, or even a sock, I'll recognize them." He says, \n"Isn't they're anything on his body?" I say he has seven gold teeth and his \nfinger, he only has half of one of his fingers. Shagen was a carpenter, he had\nbeen injured at work . . .\n\nThey brought one of the sleeves of the shirt and sweater he was wearing, they \nbrought them and they were all burned . . . When I saw them I shouted, "Oh, \nthey burned him!" I shouted, I don't know, I fell down . . . or maybe I sat \ndown, I don't remember. And that investigator says, "Well fine, fine, since \nwe've identified that these are his clothes, and since his teeth . . . since\nhe has seven gold teeth . . . "\n\nOn the 4th they told me: "Emma, it's time to bury Shagen now." I cried, "How, \nhow can I bury Shagen when I have only one son and he's sick? I should inform \nhis relatives, he has three sisters, I can't do it by myself." They say, "OK, \nyou know the situation. How will they get here from Karabagh? How will they \nget here from Yerevan? There's no transportation, it s impossible."\n\nHe was killed on February 28, and I buried him on March 7. We buried him in \nSumgait. They asked me, "Where do you want to bury him?" I said, "I want to \nbury him in Karabagh, where we were born, let me bury him in Karabagh," I'm \nshouting, and the head of the burial office, I guess, says, "Do you know what \nit means, take him to Karabagh?! It means arson!" I say, "What do you mean, \narson? Don't they know what's going on in Karabagh? The whole world knows that\nthey killed them, and I want to take him to Karabagh, I don't have anyone \nanymore." I begged, I pleaded, I grieved, I even got down on my knees. He\nsays, "Let's bury him here now, and in three months, in six months, a year, \nif it calms down, I'll help you move him to Karabagh . . . "\n\nOur trial was the first in Sumgait. It was concluded on May 16. At the\ninvestigation the murderer, Tale Ismailov, told how it all happened, but then\nat the trial he . . . tried to wriggle . . . he tried to soften his crime. \nThen they brought a videotape recorder, I guess, and played it, and said, \n"Ismailov, look, is that you?" He says, "Yes." "Well look, here you're \ndescribing everything as it was on the scene of the crime, right?" He says, \n"Yes." "And now you're telling it differently?" He says, "Well maybe I \nforgot!" Like that.\n\nThe witnesses and that criminal creep himself said that when the car was going\nalong Mir Street, there was a crowd of about 80 people . . . Shagen had a \nVolga GAZ-21. The 80 people surrounded his car, and all 80 of them were \ninvolved. One of them was this Ismailov guy, this Tale. They--it's unclear\nwho--started pulling Shagen out of the car. Well, one says from the left side\nof the car, another says from the right side. They pulled off his sports \njacket. He had a jacket on. Well they ask him, "What's your nationality?" He \nsays, "Armenian." Well they say from the crowd they shouted, "If he's an\nArmenian, kill him, kill him!" They started beating him, they broke seven of\nhis ribs, and his heart . . . I don't know, they did something there, too \n. . . it's too awful to tell about. Anyway, they say this Tale guy . . . he \nhad an armature shaft. He says, "I picked it up, it was lying near a bush, \nthat's where I got it." He said he picked it up, but the witnesses say that he\nhad already had it. He said, "I hit him twice," he said, " . . . once or twice\non the head with that rod." And he said that when he started to beat him \nShagen was sitting on the ground, and when he hit him he fell over. He said, \n"I left, right nearby they were burning things or something in an apartment,\nkilling someone," he says, "and I came back to look, is that Shagen alive or\nnot?" I said, "You wanted to finish him, right, and if he was still alive, you\ncame back to hit him again?" He went back and looked and he was already dead.\n"After that," that bastard Tale said, "after that I went home."\n\nI said, "You . . . you . . . little snake," I said, "Are you a thief and a \nmurderer?" Shagen had had money in his jacket, and a watch on his wrist. They\nwere taken. He says he didn't take them\n\nWhen they overturned and burned the car, that Tale was no longer there, it was\nother people who did that. Who it was, who turned over the car and who burned\nit, that hasn't been clarified as yet. I told the investigator, "How can you \nhave the trial when you don't know who burned the car?" He said something, but\nI didn't get what he was saying. But I said, "You still haven't straightened \neverything out, I think that's unjust."\n\nWhen they burned the car he was lying next to it, and the fire spread to him. \nIn the death certificate it says that he had third-degree burns over 80\npercent of his body . . .\n\nAnd I ask again, why was he killed? My husband was a carpenter; he was a good \ncraftsman, he knew how to do everything, he even fixed his own car, with his \nown hands. We have three children. Three sons. Only Igor was with me at the \ntime. The older one was in Pyatigorsk, and the younger one is serving in the \nArmy. And now they're fatherless...\n\nI couldn't sit all the way through it. When the Procurator read up to 15\nyears' deprivation of freedom, I just . . . I went out of my mind, I didn't\nknow what to do with myself, I said, "How can that be? You," I said, "you are \nsaying that it was intentional murder and the sentence is 15 years' \ndeprivation of freedom?" I screamed, I had my mind! I said, "Let me at that\ncreep, with my bare hands I'll . . . " A relative restrained me, and there\nwere all those military people there . . . I lest. I said," This isn't a \nSoviet trial, this is unjust!" That's what I shouted, l said it and left . . .\n\nI said that on February 27, when those people were streaming down our street, \nthey were shouting, "Long live Turkey!" and "Glory to Turkey!" And during the \ntrial I said to that Ismailov, "What does that mean, 'Glory to Turkey'?" I \nstill don't understand what Turkey has to do with this, we live in the Soviet \nUnion. That Turkey told you to or is going to help you kill Armenians? I still\ndon't understand why "Glory to Turkey!" I asked that question twice and got no\nanswer . . . No one answered me . . .\n\n   May 19, 1988\n   Yerevan\n\n		     - - - reference - - -\n\n[1] _The Sumgait Tragedy; Pogroms against Armenians in Soviet Azerbaijan,\n    Volume I, Eyewitness Accounts_, edited by Samuel Shahmuradian, forward by\n    Yelena Bonner, 1990, published by Aristide D.

I will try to answer some of Dorin's questions, even though they were\nnot addressed to me specifically, but I feel that I am a bit concerned\nby the thread since I am a Southern Lebanese from a village that is \noften on the receiving end of Israel's bombs.\nIn the first place the death of three soldiers on a patrol in occupied\nLebanese terrritory is NOT an act of terrorism or murder.  It is \ndisingeneous to compare their death to that of athletes in Munich\nor any other act of terrorism or mrder.  This exercise is aimed \nsolely at diverting the issue and is far from the truth.\nIt seems to me, Dorin, that, you are so remote and ignorant of the problem\non the ground that your comments can only be charactrized as irrelevant,\nand heavily colored by the preconceptions and misinformation.\nI will try to paint the most accurate picture I can of\nwhat the situation really is in South Lebanon.\n\n\n\nI am.  I was back in my home village this last summer.  For your information\nwe are PEOPLE, not a bunch of indiscriminate terrorists.  Most of the \npeople in my village are regular inhabitants that go about their daily\nbusiness, some work in the fields, some own small shops, others are\nolder men that go to the coffe shop and drink coffee.  Is that so hard to\nimagine ????  It is NOT a "terrorist camp" as you and the Israelis like \nto view the villages they are small communities with kids playing soccer\nin the streets, women preparing lunch, men playing cards, etc.....\nSOME young men, usually aged between 17 to 30 years are members of\nthe Lebanese resistance.  Even the inhabitants of the village do not \nknow who these are, they are secretive about it, but most people often\nsuspect who they are and what they are up to.  These young men are\nsupported financially by Iran most of the time.  They sneak arms and\nammunitions into the occupied zone where they set up booby traps\nfor Israeli patrols.  Every time an Israeli soldier is killed or injured\nby these traps, Israel retalliates by indiscriminately bombing villages\nof their own choosing often killing only innocent civilians.  Once they\nare back they announce that they bombed a "terrorist  hideout" where\nan 8 year old girl just happened to be.\nWe are now accustomed to Israeli tactics, and we figure that this is \nthe Israeli way of telling us that "if you're gonna hurt our soldiers\nyou're gonna pay the price".  We accept this as a price we have to pay\nto free our land, Israel knows very well that it is not really hurting\nthe resistance that much militarily with these strikes, but rather\njust keeping the pressure on the villagers to demand from their young \nmen to stop attacking Israeli soldiers since these attacks are\ntaking a heavy toll on the lives of the civilian villagers.\nIsrael's retalliation policy is cold hearted, but a reality that\nwe have come to accept and deal with, the Lebanese Resistance\non the other hand is not going to stop its attacks on OCCUPYING \nISRAELI SOLDIERS until they withdraw, this is the only real \nleverage that they have to force Israel to withdraw.\nThe people of South Lebanon are occupied, or shelled by Israel on a \nregular basis.  We do not want to be occupied.  If Israel insists that\nthe so called "Security Zone" is necessary for the protection of \nNorthern Israel, than it will have to pay the price of its occupation\nwith the blood of its soldiers.  If Israel is interested in peace,\nthan it should withdraw from OUR land.  We are not asking for the \nestablishment of a Lebanese occupied zone in northern Israel to protect\nour villages that are attacked on a regular basis by Israel, so the\nbest policy seems to be the removal of Israeli occupation and the\nestablishment of peace keeping troops along the border.\n\nI have written before on this very newsgroup, that the only\nreal solution will come as a result of a comprehensive peace\nsettlement whereby Israel withdraws to its own borders and\npeace keeping troops are stationed along the border to insure\nno one on either side of the border is shelled.\nThis is the only realistic solution, it is time for Israel to\nrealize that the concept of a "buffer zone" aimed at protecting\nits northern cities has failed.  In fact it has caused much more\nIsraeli deaths than the occasional shelling of Northern Israel\nwould have resulted in.  \nIf Israel really wants to save some Israeli lives it would withdraw \nunilaterally from the so-called "Security Zone" before the conclusion\nof the peace talks.  Such a move would save Israeli lives,\nadvance peace efforts, give Israel a great moral lift, better Israel's \npublic image abroad and give it an edge in the peace negociations \nsince Israel can rightly claim that it is genuinely interested in \npeace and has already offered some important concessions.\nAlong with such a withdrawal Israel could demand that Hizbollah\nbe disarmed by the Lebanese government and warn that it will not \naccept any attacks against its northern cities and that if such a\nshelling occurs than it will consider re-taking the buffer zone\nand will hold the Lebanese and Syrian government responsible for it.\nThere seems to be very little incentive for the Syrian and Lebanese\ngoovernment to allow Hizbollah to bomb Israel proper under such \ncircumstances, and now the Lebanese government has proven that it is\ncapable of controlling and disarming all militias as they did\nin all other parts of Lebanon.\n  \n\nI agree, only in the case of the Isareli soldiers their killing\nCANNOT be qualified as murder, no matter what you say.\n\n I have the feeling that you may be able yourself to make\n\nYes, we have no quarrel with Jews, or Israeli civilians.\nThe real problem is with OCCUPYING Israeli soldiers and those brave\nIsraeli pilots that bomb our civilian villages every time an \noccupying soldier is attacked.
Dear folks,\n\nI am still awaiting for some sensible answer and comment.\n\nIt is a fact that the inhabitants of Gaza are not entitled to a normal\ncivlized life. They habe been kept under occupation by Israel since 1967\nwithout civil and political rights. \n\nIt is a fact that Gazans live in their own country, Palestine. Gaza is\nnot a foriegn country. Nor is TelAviv, Jaffa, Askalon, BeerSheba foreign\ncountry for Gazans. All these places are occupied as far as Palestinians\nare concerned and as far as common sense has it. \n\nIt is a fact that Zionists deny Gazans equal rights as Israeli citizens\nand the right to determine by themsevles their government. When Zionists\nwill begin to consider Gazans as human beings who deserve the same\nrights as themselves, there will be hope for peace. Not before.\n\nSomebody mentioned that Gaza is 'foreign country' and therefore Israel\nis entitled to close its borders to Gaza. In this case, Gaza should be\nentitled to reciprocate, and deny Israeli civilians and military personnel\nto enter the area. As the relation is not symmetrical, but that of a master\nand slave, the label 'foreign country' is inaccurate and misleading.\n\nTo close off 700,000 people in the Strip, deny them means of subsistence\nand means of defending themselves, is a collective punishment and a\ncrime. It is neither justifiable nor legal. It just reflects the abyss \nto which Israeli society has degraded. \n\nI would like to ask any of those who heap foul langauge on me to explain\nwhy Israel denies Gazans who were born and brought up in Jaffa to return\nand live there ? Would they be allowed to, if they converted to Judaism ?\nIs their right to live in their former town depdendent upon their\nreligion or ethnic origin ? Please give an honest answer.
Already say it the other week on CBC Snoozeworld\n\n\nYeah, I thought Bonanza was full of lies about the West...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy the hell would such an oil rich (and hydroelectric potential to be\nexploited) spend billions on a nuclear energy programme?\n\n\nYeah, and we have every reason in the world to trust the Iranian regime.\nAfter all, they've been *so* forward with us in the past....\n\n\nMaybe he *is* God!
Armenia is involved in fighting with Azarbaijan.  It is Armenian\nsoldiers from mainland Armenia that are shelling towns in Azarbaijan.\nYou might wish to read more about whether or not it is Azeri aggression\nonly in that region.  It seems to me that the Armenians are better\norganized, have more success militarily and shell Azeri towns\nrepeatedly.  \n\nI don't wish to get into the Cyprus discussion.  Turkey had the right to\nintervene, and it did.  Perhaps the intervention was not supposed to\nlast for so long, but the constant refusal of the Greek governments both\non the island and in Greece to deal with reality is also to be blamed\nfor the ongoing standoff in the region.  \n\nLastly, why is there not a soc.culture.armenia?  I vote yes for it.\nAfter all, it is now free.

Sooner than you expect. Remember 'Cyprus'?\n\n\nToo bad. In fact, by 1942, Nazi Armenians in Europe had established \na vast network of pro-German collaborators, that extended over two \ncontinents. Thousands of Armenians were serving the German army and \nWaffen-SS in Russia and Western Europe. Armenians were involved in \nespionage and fifth-column activities for Hitler in the Balkans and \nArabian Peninsula. They were promised an 'independent' state under \nGerman 'protection' in an agreement signed by the 'Armenian National \nCouncil.' (A copy of this agreement can be found in the 'Congressional \nRecord,' November 1, 1945; see Document 1.) On this side of the Atlantic, \nNazi Armenians were aware of their brethrens alliance. They had often \nexpressed pro-Nazi sentiments until America entered the war. In summary,\nduring World War II Armenians were carried away with the German might and\ncringing and fawning over the Nazis. In that zeal, the Armenian publication\nin Germany, Hairenik, carried statements as follows:[1]\n\n"Sometimes it is difficult to eradicate these poisonous elements (the Jews)\n when they have struck deep root like a chronic disease, and when it \n becomes necessary for a people (the Nazis) to eradicate them in an uncommon\n method, these attempts are regarded as revolutionary. During the surgical\n operation, the flow of blood is a natural thing." \n\nNow for a brief view of the Armenian genocide of the Muslims and Jews -\nextracts from a letter dated December 11, 1983, published in the San\nFrancisco Chronicle, as an answer to a letter that had been published\nin the same journal under the signature of one B. Amarian.\n\n "...We have first hand information and evidence of Armenian atrocities\n  against our people (Jews)...Members of our family witnessed the \n  murder of 148 members of our family near Erzurum, Turkey, by Armenian \n  neighbors, bent on destroying anything and anybody remotely Jewish \n  and/or Muslim. Armenians should look to their own history and see \n  the havoc they and their ancestors perpetrated upon their neighbors...\n  Armenians were in league with Hitler in the last war, on his premise \n  to grant them self government if, in return, the Armenians would \n  help exterminate Jews...Armenians were also hearty proponents of\n  the anti-Semitic acts in league with the Russian Communists. Mr. Amarian!\n  I don't need your bias."  \n\n  Signed Elihu Ben Levi, Vacaville, California.\n\n[1] James G.

We can get back to the \nquestion of which law should be used in the territories later. Also, you have \nnot adressed my question if the israelis also have human rights.\n\n   What do you expect me to tell you, Master of Wisdom, when I did explain my\n   point in the post, that you "responded to". The point is that since Israel \n   is occupying then it is automatically depriving itself from some of its rights \n   to the Occupied Palestineans, which is exactly similar the automatic \n   deprivation of a killer from his right of life to the society.\n\nIf a state can deprive all it's citizens of human rights by its actions, then \ntell me why _any_ human living today should have any rights at all?\n\n   |> |> In conjugtion with the above, when a group of people occupies others \n   |> |> territories and rule them by force, then this group would be -willingly or \n   |> |> unwillingly- deprived from some of its rights. \n\n   |> Such as the right to live?

It is appropriate to add what Himmler said other "inferior races" \nand "human animals" in his speech at Posen and elsewhere:\n\n\nFrom the speech of Reichsfuehrer-SS Himmler, before SS\nMajor-Generals, Posen, October 4 1943\n["Nazi Conspiracy and Aggression", Vol. IV, p. 559]\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\nOne basic principal must be the absolute rule for the SS man: we\nmust be honest, decent, loyal, and comradely to members of our own\nblood and to nobody else. What happens to a Russian, to a Czech,\ndoes not interest me in the slightest. What the nations can offer\nin good blood of our type, we will take, if necessary by kidnapping\ntheir children and raising them with us. Whether nations live in\nprosperity or starve to death interests me only in so far as we\nneed them as slaves for our culture; otherwise, it is of no interest\nto me. Whether 10,000 Russian females fall down from exhaustion\nwhile digging an anti-tank ditch interest me only in so far as\nthe anti-tank ditch for Germany is finished. We shall never be rough\nand heartless when it is not necessary, that is clear. We Germans,\nwho are the only people in the world who have a decent attitude\ntowards animals, will also assume a decent attitude towards these\nhuman animals. But it is a crime against our own blood to worry\nabout them and give them ideals, thus causing our sons and\ngrandsons to have a more difficult time with them. When someone\ncomes to me and says, "I cannot dig the anti-tank ditch with women\nand children, it is inhuman, for it will kill them", then I\nwould have to say, "you are a murderer of your own blood because\nif the anti-tank ditch is not dug, German soldiers will die, and\nthey are the sons of German mothers. They are our own blood".\n\n\n\nExtract from Himmler's address to party comrades, September 7 1940\n["Trials of Wa Criminals", Vol. IV, p. 1140]\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nIf any Pole has any sexual dealing with a German woman, and by this\nI mean sexual intercourse, then the man will be hanged right in\nfront of his camp. Then the others will not do it. Besides,\nprovisions will be made that a sufficient number of Polish women\nand girls will come along as well so that a necessity of this\nkind is out of the question.\n\nThe women will be brought before the courts without mercy, and\nwhere the facts are not sufficiently proved - such borderline\ncases always happen - they will be sent to a concentration camp.\nThis we must do, unless these one million Poles and those\nhundreds of thousands of workers of alien blood are to inflict\nuntold damage on the German blood. Philosophizing is of no avail\nin this case. It would be better if we did not have them at all -\nwe all know that - but we need them.

Here we have an enraged Likudnik who\n    is venting his spleen, and you portray it as if this is going\n    to become policy.  You don't say what the response to Matza's\n    suggestion was.  Do do not mention whether he was refering to\n    terrorists caught in the act, which could be a clear cut case\n    of self-defence.

The\n    absurdity of your respectable name cannot hide your bias.\n\n    In your effort to portray Israel in an unfavorable light, you \n    have accomplished nothing, except to prove that a respectable \n    sounding label like the Center for Policy Research is nothing \n    but a smoke screen for someone with a heavily biased attitude \n    against Israel and the need to vent it.

Trumpets, please.\n\n\n"Forced to go to Palestine."  How dreadful.  Unlike other\nundesirables/Jews, she wasn't forced to go into a gas chamber, forced\nunder a bulldozer, thrown into a river, forced into a "Medical\nexperiment" like a rat, forced to march until she dropped dead, burned\nto nothingness in a crematorium.  Your mother was "forced to go to\nPalestine."  You have our deepest sympathies.\n\n\nWe are pleased to hear of your escape.  At least you won't have to\nsuffer the same fate that your mother did.\n\n\nYour homeland, Palestine?  \n\n\nShould we assume that you are refering here to Jews who were kicked\nout of their homes in Jerusalem during the Jordanian Occupation of\nEast Jerusalem?  These are the same people who are now being called\nthieves for re-claiming houses that they once owned and lived in and\nnever sold to anyone?\n\n\nI have never heard of NOT being a Jew as a crime.  Certainly in\nIsrael, there is no such crime.  In some times and places BEING a Jew\nis a crime, but NOT being a Jew??!!\n\n\nOur brains do not accept your logic, yet, either.\n\n\nThe way you've written this, you seem to accept criticism in the Arab\nworld UNLESS it deflects criticism from Israel, in which case, we have\nto presume, you no longer support criticism of the Arab world.\n\n\nLook who's taling about discrimination now!\n\n\nBe careful.  You are starting to sound like Barfling.\n\n\nGood.  Don't call yourself "ARF" or "the Center for Policy Research",\neither.

100% Israeli citizens.  The ethnic composition depends on what\nyou mean by formed.  What the UN deeded to Israel?  What it won in war?\n\n\n\n	Were there anti-trust laws in place in mandatory Palestine?\nSince the answer is no, you're argument, while interestingly\nconstructed, is irrelevant.  I will however, respond to a few points\nyou assert in the course of talking about anti-trust laws.\n\n\n\n	And those fleeing Arab lands, where Jews were second class\ncitizens. \n\n\n	Jews often paid far more than fair market value for the land\nthey bought.\n\n\n	You know, Sam, when people start talking about an\nInternational Jewish conspiracy, its really begins to sound like\nanti-Semitic bull.\n\n	The reason there is no conspiracy here is quite simple.\nZionists made no bones about what was going on.  There were\nconferences, publications, etc, all talking about creating a National\nhome for the Jews.\n\n\n\n[...]\n\n	Because you've never heard of it, its dead?  The fact is, you\nclaimed Israel had to give arabs rights because of (non-existant)\nInternational aid.  Then you see that that argument has a hole you\ncould drive a truck through, and again assert that Israel is only\ndemocratic within the (unexplained) constraints of one ethnic group.\nThe problem with that argument is that Arabs are allowed to vote for\nwhoever they please.  So, please tell me, Sam, what constraints are\nthere on Israeli democracy that don't exist in other democratic\nstates?\n\n	I've never heard anything about the Khazakistani arab\npopulation.  Does that mean that they have no history or roots?  When\nI was at Ben Gurion university in Israel, one of my neighbors was an\nIsraeli arab.  He wasn't really all that different from my other\nneighbors.  Does that make him dead or oppressed?\n\n\n\n	How recent is recent?  I can probably build a case for a\nJewish Gaza city.  It would be pretty silly, but I could do it.  I'm\narguing not that Jerusalem is Jewish, but that land has no ethnicity.\n\nAdam\n\n\n\nAdam Shostack 				       adam@das.harvard.edu

Although the Hebrew expression LE'UM is used, the ID card specifically states on\nthe 2nd page: EZRACHUT YISREALIT: Israeli citizen. This is true for all\nIsraeli citizens no matter what their ethnicity. In the United States most\nofficial forms have RACE (Caucasian, Black, AmerIndian, etc.).\n\n\nFunny, I have a number of maps and ALL of them have fixed borders.\n\n\n\n\nProbably yes. So what ?\n\n\n\n\n\nApart from Mordechai Vanunu who had a trial behind closed doors, there was one\nother espionage case (the nutty professor at the Nes Ziona Biological\nInstitute who was a K.G.B. mole) who was tried "in camera". I wouldn't exactly\ncall it a state secret. The trial was simply tried behind closed doors. I hate\nto disappoint you but the United States has tried a number of espionage cases\nin camera.\n\n\n\nNot Jews. Israeli citizens. Jordanian law is in effect in the West Bank but the\nKNESSET passed a law that Israeli law would be binding on Israeli citizens\nresiding in the West Bank. These citizens could be Jews, Israeli Muslims, Druze,\nor Israeli Christians. It has NOTHING to do with religion.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnyone who was registered (Jew, Muslim, Christian) could return. You might be\nconfusing this with the census taken in June 1967 on the West Bank after the\nSix Day War. In *this* instance, if the Arab was not physically present he\ncouldn't reside on the West Bank (e.g. if he had been visting Jordan).\n\n\n\nNo. Not even if you drowned him in bourbon, scotch or brandy :-)\n\n\n\n\nNot true. Although a minority, there *are* some Israeli Arabs living on\nkibbutzim. On the other hand, at my age (42) I wouldn't be admitted to a\nkibbutz nor could the family join me. Not that I would be so thrilled to do so\nin the first place. The kibbbutz movement places candidates under rigorous\nmembership criteria. Many Israeli Jews are not admitted.\n\n\n\nThe religious status quo in Israel has marriage and divorce  handled by the\nreligious courts. The RABBANUT handles marriage and divorce for Jews, the\nMuslim SHAARIA  courts are for Muslims, the Christian denominations have their\nreligious courts, and the Druze have their own courts. The entire religious\nestablishment (Jewish, Muslim, Druze, Christian) wants to keep it that way.\n\n\nI believe it's adjacent to a former Muslim cemetary. From what I heard (and I'd\nlike to get feedback from Muslins  on the net) sanctity of cemetaries is not\nheld that sancrosanct as it is held by Jews. The current Israeli Ministry of\nTrade and Industry on Agron Road in Jerusalem is housed in a former hotel that\nwas built by Arabs in the 1920's on the site of an Arab cemetary.\n\n\nJosh\nbackon@VMS.HUJI.AC.IL

I always like your kind of odds. The Greek governments must be held \nto account for the sub-human conditions of the Turkish minority living \nin the Western Thrace under the brutal Greek domination.

In the camps, he added, \nterrorists were trained to use various weapons including RPG's \nand anti-aircraft guns which had been purchased directly from \nthe Greek government. Greek Cypriot government has gone to the \nextent of issuing special identification cards to PKK members so \nthat they can travel from one region to another without being \nconfronted by legal obstacles. Demirok's account was confirmed \nby another PKK defector, Fatih Tan, who gave himself over to \npolice in Hakkari after spending four years with PKK.

Sounds like wishful guessing.\n\n\n\n\n'So-called' ? What do you mean ? How would you see the peace process?\n\nSo you say palestineans do not negociate because of 'well-founded' predictions ?\nHow do you know that they are 'well founded' if you do not test them at the \ntable ? 18 months did not prove anything, but it's always the other side at \nfault, right ?\n\nWhy ? I do not know why, but if, let's say, the Palestineans (some of them) want\nALL ISRAEL, and these are known not to be accepted terms by israelis.\n\nOr, maybe they (palestinenans) are not yet ready for statehood ?\n\nOr, maybe there is too much politics within the palestinean leadership, too many\nfractions aso ?\n\nI am not saying that one of these reasons is indeed the real one, but any of\nthese could make arabs stall the negotiations.\n\n \nI like California oranges.

Let us not forget the Nazi Armenians. Nazi Armenians were of service \nto Germans in Arab countries as well. As Uzun put it, one well-known \ncase which received a lot of media-coverage involved two Nazi Armenian \nagents which were dropped over Syria by Italian war planes. The mission \nof the agents was to mingle among the Armenian population in Syria and \nto acquire relevant information for the German Wehrmacht on the allied \nforces in the area.[1] Nazi Armenians also helped German propaganda \nefforts in Arab countries designed to promote pro-Nazi sentiments among \nthe French- and British-ruled Arab populations. Beirut had traditionally\nbeen strong-hold of the Nazi Armenians and until very recently it was\nthe center of international Armenian terrorism. \n\nIn Russia General Dro (the Butcher), the architect of the Turkish\ngenocide in WWI, was working closely with the German Secret \nService. He entered the war zone with his own men and acquired\nimportant intelligence about the Soviets. His experience with\nthe Turkish genocide in x-Soviet Armenia made him an invaluable \nsource for the Germans.[2]\n\n[1] Meyer, Berkian, ibid., p. 150. \n[2] Meyer, Berkian, ibid., p. 113; Patrick von zur Muehlen,\n    ibid., p. 84.\n\nSerdar Argic

Anyone care to speculate on this? I'll let the rest of the net judge\nthis on its own merits. Between 1914 and 1920, 2.5 million Turks perished \nof butchery at the hands of Armenians. The genocide involved not only \nthe killing of innocents but their forcible deportation from the Russian \nArmenia. They were persecuted, banished, and slaughtered while much of \nOttoman Army was engaged in World War I. The Genocide Treaty defines \ngenocide as acting with a \n\n  'specific intent to destroy, in whole or in substantial part, a \n   national, ethnic, racial or religious group.' \n\nHistory shows that the x-Soviet Armenian Government intended to eradicate \nthe Muslim population. 2.5 million Turks and Kurds were exterminated by the \nArmenians. International diplomats in Ottoman Empire at the time - including \nU.S. Ambassador Bristol - denounced the x-Soviet Armenian Government's policy \nas a massacre of the Kurds, Turks, and Tartars. The blood-thirsty leaders of \nthe x-Soviet Armenian Government at the time personally involved in the \nextermination of the Muslims. The Turkish genocide museums in Turkiye honor \nthose who died during the Turkish massacres perpetrated by the Armenians. \n\nThe eyewitness accounts and the historical documents established,\nbeyond any doubt, that the massacres against the Muslim people\nduring the war were planned and premeditated. The aim of the policy\nwas clearly the extermination of all Turks in x-Soviet Armenian \nterritories.\n\nThe Muslims of Van, Bitlis, Mus, Erzurum and Erzincan districts and\ntheir wives and children have been taken to the mountains and killed.\nThe massacres in Trabzon, Tercan, Yozgat and Adana were organized and\nperpetrated by the blood-thirsty leaders of the x-Soviet Armenian \nGovernment.\n\nThe principal organizers of the slaughter of innocent Muslims were\nDro, Antranik, Armen Garo, Hamarosp, Daro Pastirmadjian, Keri,\nKarakin, Haig Pajise-liantz and Silikian.\n\nSource: "Bristol Papers", General Correspondence: Container #32 - Bristol\n         to Bradley Letter of September 14, 1920.\n\n"I have it from absolute first-hand information that the Armenians in \n the Caucasus attacked Tartar (Turkish) villages that are utterly \n defenseless and bombarded these villages with artillery and they murder\n the inhabitants, pillage the village and often burn the village."\n\n\nSources: (The Ottoman State, the Ministry of War), "Islam Ahalinin \nDucar Olduklari Mezalim Hakkinda Vesaike Mustenid Malumat," (Istanbul, 1918). \nThe French version: "Documents Relatifs aux Atrocites Commises par les Armeniens\nsur la Population Musulmane," (Istanbul, 1919).

Dr. Goebels thought that a lie repeated enough times could finally \nbe believed. I have been observing that 'Poly' has been practicing \nGoebels' rule quite loyally. 'Poly's audience is mostly made of Greeks \nwho are not allowed to listen to Turkish news. However, in today's \ninformed world Greek propagandists can only fool themselves. For \ninstance, those who lived in 1974 will remember the TV news they \nwatched and the newspapers they read and the younger generation can \nread the American newspapers of July and August 1974 to find out what \nreally happened. \n\nThere are in Turkiye the Greek Hospital, The Greek Girls' Lycee \nAlumni Association, the Principo Islands Greek Benevolent Society, \nthe Greek Medical Foundation, the Principo Greek Orphanage Foundation, \nthe Yovakimion Greek Girls' Lycee Foundation, and the Fener Greek \nMen's Lycee Foundation.  \n\nAs for Greece, the longstanding use of the adjective 'Turkish' \nin titles and on signboards is prohibited. The Greek courts \nhave ordered the closure of the Turkish Teachers' Association, \nthe Komotini Turkish Youth Association and the Ksanti \nTurkish Association on grounds that there are no Turks\nin Western Thrace. Such community associations had been \nactive until 1984. But they were first told to remove\nthe word 'Turkish' on their buildings and on their official\npapers and then eventually close down. This is also the \nfinal verdict (November 4, 1987) of the Greek High Court.\n\nIn the city of Komotini, a former Greek Parliamentarian of Turkish\nparentage, was sentenced recently to 18 months of imprisonment\nwith no right to appeal, just for saying outloud that he was\nof Turkish descent. This duly-elected ethnic Turkish official\nwas also deprived of his political rights for a period of three \nyears. Each one of these barbaric acts seems to be none other than \na vehicle, used by the Greek governments, to cover-up their inferiority \ncomplex they display, vis-a-vis, the people of Turkiye. \n\nThe Agreement on the Exchange of Minorities uses the term 'Turks,' \nwhich demonstrates what is actually meant by the previous reference \nto 'Muslims.' The fact that the Greek governments also mention the \nexistence of a few thousand non-Turkish Muslims does not change the \nessential reality that there lives in Western Thrace a much bigger \nTurkish minority. The 'Pomaks' are also a Muslim people, whom all the \nthree nations (Bulgarians, Turks, and Greeks) consider as part of \nthemselves. Do you know how the Muslim Turkish minority was organized \naccording to the agreements? Poor 'Poly.'\n\nIt also proves that the Turkish people are trapped in Greece \nand the Greek people are free to settle anywhere in the world.\nThe Greek authorities deny even the existence of a Turkish\nminority. They pursue the same denial in connection with \nthe Macedonians of Greece. Talk about oppression. In addition,\nin 1980 the 'democratic' Greek Parliament passed Law No. 1091,\nvirtually taking over the administration of the vakiflar and\nother charitable trusts. They have ceased to be self-supporting\nreligious and cultural entities. Talk about fascism. The Greek \ngovernments are attempting to appoint the muftus, irrespective\nof the will of the Turkish minority, as state official. Although\nthe Orthodox Church has full authority in similar matters in\nGreece, the Muslim Turkish minority will have no say in electing\nits religious leaders. Talk about democracy.\n\nThe government of Greece has recently destroyed an Islamic \nconvention in Komotini. Such destruction, which reflects an \nattitude against the Muslim Turkish cultural heritage, is a \nviolation of the Lausanne Convention as well as the 'so-called' \nGreek Constitution, which is supposed to guarantee the protection \nof historical monuments. \n\nThe government of Greece, on the other hand, is building new \nchurches in remote villages as a complementary step toward \nHellenizing the region.\n\nAnd you pondered. Sidiropoulos, the president of the Macedonian Human \nRights Committee, became the latest victim of a tactic long used by \nthe Greeks to silence critics of policies of forced assimilation \nof the Macedonian minority. A forestry official by occupation, \nSidiropoulos has been sent to 'internal exile' on the island of \nKefalonia, hundreds of kilometers away from his native Florina. \nHis employer, the Florina City Council, asked him to depart in \n24 hours. The Greek authorities are trying to punish him for his \ninvolvement in Copenhagen. He returned to Florina by his own choice \nand remains without a job. \n\nHelsinki Watch, a well-known Human Rights group, had been investigating \nthe plight of the Turkish Minority in Greece. In August 1990, their \nfindings were published in a report titled \n\n 'Destroying Ethnic Identity: Turks of Greece.'\n\nThe report confirmed gross violations of the Human Rights of the \nTurkish minority by the Greek authorities. It says for instance, \nthe Greek government recently destroyed an Islamic convent in \nKomotini. Such destruction, which reflects an attitude against \nthe Muslim Turkish cultural heritage, is a violation of the \nLausanne Convention. \n\nThe Turkish cemeteries in the village of Vafeika and in Pinarlik\nwere attacked, and tombstones were broken. The cemetery in\nKarotas was razed by bulldozers.\n\nShall I go on? Why not? The people of Turkiye are not going \nto take human rights lessons from the Greek Government. The \ndiscussion of human rights violations in Greece does not \nstop at the Greek frontier. In several following articles \nI shall dwell on and expose the Greek treatment of Turks\nin Western Thrace and the Aegean Macedonians.\n\nIt has been reported that the Greek Cypriot administration \nhas an intense desire for arms and that Greece has made \nplans to supply it with the tanks and armored vehicles it \nhas to destroy in accordance with the agreement reached on \nconventional arms reductions in Europe. Meanwhile, Greek \nand Greek Cypriot officials are reported to have planned \nto take ostentatious measures aimed at camouflaging the \ntransfer of these tanks and armored vehicles to southern \nCyprus, a process that will conflict with the spirit of \nthe agreement on conventional arms reduction in Europe.\n\nAn acceptable method may certainly be found when there\nis a will. But we know of various kinds of violent\nbehaviors ranging from physical attacks to the burning\nof buildings. The rugs at the Amfia village mosque were \ndragged out to the front of the building and burnt there. \nShots were fired on the mosque in the village of Aryana.\n\nNow wait, there is more.\n\n  'Greek Atrocities in the Vilayet of Smyrna (May to July 1919), Inedited\n  Documents and Evidence of English and French Officers,' Published by\n  The Permanent Bureau of the Turkish Congress at Lausanne, Lausanne,\n  Imprimerie Petter, Giesser & Held, Caroline, 5 (1919).\n\n  pages 82-83:\n\n<< 1. The train going from Denizli to Smyrna was stopped at Ephesus\n   and the 90 Turkish travellers, men and women who were in it ordered\n   to descend. And there in the open street, under the eyes of their\n   husbands, fathers and brothers, the women without distinction of age\n   were violated, and then all the travellers were massacred. Amongst\n   the latter the Lieutenant Salih Effendi, a native of Tripoli, and a\n   captain whose name is not known, and to whom the Hellenic authorities\n   had given safe conduct, were killed with specially atrocious tortures.\n\n   2. Before the battle, the wife of the lawyer Enver Bey coming from\n   her garden was maltreated by Greek soldiers, she was even stript\n   of her garments and her servant Assie was violated.\n\n   3. The two tax gatherers Mustapha and Ali Effendi were killed in the\n   following manner: Their arms were bound behind their backs with wire\n   and their heads were battered and burst open with blows from the butt\n   end of a gun.\n\n   4. During the firing of the town, eleven children, six little girls\n   and five boys, fleeing from the flames, were stopped by Greek soldiers\n   in the Ramazan Pacha quarter, and thrown into a burning Jewish house\n   near bridge, where they were burnt alive. This fact is confirmed on oath\n   by the retired commandant Hussein Hussni Effendi who saw it.\n\n   5. The clock-maker Ahmed Effendi and his son Sadi were arrested and\n   dragged out of their shop. The son had his eyes put out and was then\n   killed in the court of the Greek Church, but Ahmed Effendi has been\n   no more heard of.\n\n   6. At the market, during the fire, two unknown people were wounded\n   by bayonets, then bound together, thrown into the fire and burnt alive.\n\n   The Greeks killed also many Jews.

I sure hope so. Because, the unspeakable crimes of the Armenians must \nbe righted. Armenian invaders burned and sacked the fatherland of \nUrartus, massacred and exterminated its population and presented to \nthe world all those left from the Urartus, as the Armenian civilization.\n\nAll reliable Western historians describe how Armenians ruthlessly\nexterminated 2.5 million Muslim women, children and elderly people of \nEastern Anatolia and how they collaborated with the enemies of the \nOttoman Empire between 1914-1920.\n\nIt is unfortunately a truth that Armenians are known as collaborators\nof the Nazis during World War II and that, even today, criminal/Nazi\nmembers of the ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism Triangle preach and instigate\nracism, hatred, violence and terrorism among peoples. \n\nAnd x-Soviet Armenia continues its anti-Turkish policy in the following \nways:\n\n1. x-Soviet Armenia denies the historical fact of the Turkish Genocide\nin order to shift international public opinion away from its political\nresponsibility.\n\n2. x-Soviet Armenia, employing ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism \nTriangle and criminal/Nazi Armenians, attempts to call into question the \nveracity of the Turkish Genocide.\n\n3. x-Soviet Armenia has also implemented state-sponsored terrorism through\nthe ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle in an attempt to \nsilence the Turkish people's vehement demands and protests.\n\n4. Using all its human, financial, and governmental resources, x-Soviet\nArmenia and its tools in the United States attempt to silence through\nterrorism, bribery and other subversive methods, non-Turkish supporters\nof the Turkish cause, be they political, governmental and humanitarian.\n\nUsing all the aforementioned methods, the x-Soviet Armenian government \nis attempting to neutralize the international diplomatic community from\nmaking the Turkish Case a contemporary issue.\n\nYet despite the efforts of the x-Soviet Armenian government and its terrorist\nand revisionist organizations, in the last decades, thanks to the struggle \nof those whose closest ones were systematically exterminated by the Armenians,\nthe international wall of silence on this issue has begun to collapse, and \nconsequently a number of governments and organizations have become \nsupportive of the recognition of the Turkish Genocide.\n\nSerdar Argic
Sorry, I misread your remark about young men and women.  (Though I am now\nunsure what that sentence does mean.)\n\n\nYou implied that anyone who wants to send troops to Bosnia wants to do so to\nhelp the "butchers of their choice".  Since the primary targets of help are\nMuslim victims of "ethnic cleansing", you imply that such Muslim victims are\nbutchers.\n\n\nThis implies both sides are equal.  True, it may sometimes be difficult or\nimpossible to determine which side is the victim, but that does not mean that\nvictims do not exist.  Would you, in WWII have said that there were atrocities\non the sides of both the Jews and the Germans?\n\n\nYes, but both sides want different things.  The Muslims chiefly want to not\nbe "ethnic cleansed".  The Serbians want to "ethnic cleanse" the Muslims.  It\nis indeed true that each side will stop when it gets what it wants, but the\nthings that the two sides want are not equivalent.\n\n\nI recall, before we did anything for Somalia, (apparent) left-wingers saying\nthat the reason everyone was more willing to send troops to Bosnia than to\nSomalia was because the Somalis are third-worlders who Americans consider\nunworthy of help.  They suddenly shut up when the US decided to send troops to\nthe opposite place than that predicted by the theory.\n\nFor that matter, this theory of yours suggests that Americans should want to\nhelp the Serbs.  After all, they're Christian, and the Muslims are not.  If\nthe desire to intervene in Bosnia is based on racism against people that are\nless like us, why does everyone _want_ to help the side that _is_ less like us?\nEspecially if both of the sides are equal as you seem to think?\n--\n"On the first day after Christmas my truelove served to me...

[ANAS] There are many neutral human rights organizations which always report\n[ANAS] on the situation in the O.T.  But, as most people used to see on TV, the\n[ANAS] Israelis do not allow them to go deep there in the O.T.  The Israelis \n[ANAS] used to arrest and sometimes to kill some of these neutral reporters.  \n[ANAS] So, this is another kind of terrorism committed by the Jews in Palestine.\n[ANAS] They do not allow fair and neutral coverage of the situation in \n[ANAS] Palestine.\n\nBring me one case where Israeli Soldiers deliberately killed a "neutral \nreporter".  This is another one of your wet dreams.\n\nUnlike many countries, Israel does allow reporters in and out of the O.T. \nThat is what the problem is. If Israel were a country like China, then \nnothing would transpire from what is happening in the O.T. But there\nseems to be a proliferation of journalists in Israel always trying to show\nhow evil the Israeli monster is. Arab countries don't allow journalists \nanywhere, we have yet to hear about the massacres of Kurds, the destruction\nand annihilation of Hama, the killings of moslem fundamentalists in mosques\nin Egypt and Algeria etc...

G-d has nothing to do with it. Some of the land was in fact given to the  \nJews by the United Nations, quite a bit of it was purchased from Arab  \nabsentee landlords. Present claims are based on prior ownership (purchase  \nfrom aforementioned absentee landlords) award by the United Nations in the  \npartition of the Palestine mandate territory, and as the result of  \ndefensive wars fought against the Egyptians, Syrians, Jordanians, et al.\n\n***\nFirst, I should point out that many Jews do not in fact agree with the  \nidea that the West Bank is theirs. Since,  however, I agree with those who  \nclaim the West Bank, I think I can answer your question thusly: the West  \nbank was what is called the spoils of war. Hussein ordered the Arab Legion  \nto attack Israel, which was a poor move, seeing as how the Israelis  \npromptly kicked his butt. The territory is therefore forefeit.  Retaining  \npossession of ALL of the West bank is  not desirable, but it beats  \nnational suicide for the Israelis. Put another way, one could ask why it  \nis that so many Palestinians seem to think that Tel-Aviv belongs to them  \nand the future state of Palestine. As long as this state of affairs  \ncontinues, it seems that to give the Palestinians a place from which they  \ncan launch attacks on Jews is a real poor idea. Giving up the entire West  \nBank would be idiotic froma security standpoint.  In addition, there is  \nthe small matter of Jerusalem, which is considered to be part of the West  \nBank. The chances of the Israelis giving up Jerusalem are nil. Even  \nleftists who think Yasser is a really cool dude, like Yossi Sarid, aren't  \ngoing to propose giving up Jerusalem. If he did, he'd get run out of town  \non a rail.
Right.  We'll probably end up giving them weapons.\n\n\nDuring WWII, the British managed to supply arms to the Yugoslavs despite\nGerman occupation.  If the Europeans had the will to do anything besides\nsponsoring peace conferences, they would have no problem putting any kind of\nweapon they wanted into Bosnia.\n\nI guess I would favor ending the embargo if the Congress would pass a law\nforbidding export of US military supplies to Yugoslavia, including via third\nparties.  Until then the risks of the US being drawn into a more active\nrole would be too great.  I do not see the arms embargo as a major factor in\nthe outcome of the war.\n\n\nBoth sides are certainly not equal in the eyes of the press.  And that's\nabout all we have to go on, isn't it?  \n\nAnd I wish you'd quit hurling words like racist around.  There are many levels\nat which people react to what they see.  At the most fundamental level, you\ndo not have to consciously recognize the racial element - you simply tend to\nempathize more with people who are like yourself.  As far preferring\nChristian over Moslem, I am an atheist myself, and I think you'll agree that\nin the US, the majority of people do not typically discriminate on the basis of\nreligion, nor give it a particularly important place in their world view.

I would hope that if you intend to have a reasonable discussion you might\nwait until I express an opinion before deciding I should be flamed for it.\nAs for 'war' I am not sure how I would define it. If you just look at attacks\non villages then there is no way of deciding when it started. Would you\ncount the riots in the 20's and 30's? Violence but not war. I personally\nthink that 'war', as opposed to civil disturbance or whatever, requires\norganisation, planning and some measure of regualr or semi-regular forces.\nPerhaps the Arab Liberation Army counts. I could easily be convinced it was\nso. From what I know they did not have a great deal of planning let alone\norganisation. The Haganah and Palmach certainly did. That is not a cause\nfor criticism, it merely reflects the great organisation generally in the\n'Zionist' camp.\n\n\nNow you are being silly aren't you? In any case the war did NOT start\nwith the invasion of the Arab Armies. You see we both agree on something.\nAnd the previous posters were wrong, no?\n\n\nAgain I am not sure, I doubt you want my opinion anyway, but I think\nwar requires organisation as I said before. It needs a group to command\nand plan. If Fatah lauches rockets from Southern Lebanon (and are you\nsure you have the right group - not the Moslems again?) then that sounds\nlike war to me. Stone throwing does not.\n\nJoseph Askew
Is this the joke of the month? \n\n1. Your fascist grandparents exterminated 2.5 million Muslim people\nbetween 1914 and 1920.\n\n2. Your Nazi parents fully participated in the extermination of the\nEuropean Jewry during WWII.\n\n3. Your criminal cousins have been slaughtering Muslim women, children\nand elderly people in fascist x-Soviet Armenia and Karabag for the last \nfour years.\n\nThe entire population of x-Soviet Armenia now, as a result of the \nGenocide of 2.5 million Muslim people, are Armenians. \n\nFor nearly one thousand years, the Turkish and Kurdish people \nlived on their homeland - the last one hundred under the \noppressive Soviet and Armenian occupation. The persecutions\nculminated in 1914: The Armenian Government planned and carried \nout a Genocide against its Muslim subjects. 2.5 million Turks \nand Kurds were murdered and the remainder driven out of their \nhomeland. After one thousand years, Turkish and Kurdish lands \nwere empty of Turks and Kurds. \n\nThe survivors found a safe heaven in Turkiye.\n\nToday, x-Soviet Armenian government rejects the right of Turks and \nKurds to return to their Muslim lands occupied by x-Soviet Armenia.\n\nToday, x-Soviet Armenian government covers up the genocide perpetrated \nby its predecessors and is therefore an accessory to this crime against \nhumanity.\n\nx-Soviet Armenian government must pay for their crime of genocide \nagainst the Muslims by admitting to the crime and making reparations \nto the Turks and Kurds.\n\nTurks and Kurds demand the right to return to their lands, to determine \ntheir own future as a nation in their own homeland.\n\nDuring the 78th Anniversary, we come once again reiterate the\nunity of the Muslim People, the timelessness of the Turkish\nand Kurdish Demands and the desire to pursue the struggle\nfor that restitution - a struggle that unites all Turks and Kurds.\n\nToday, we appeal to all Turkish and Kurdish people in the United \nStates and Canada to participate en masse in the Commemorative \nEvents, be they cultural, political or religious.\n\n\nSerdar Argic

And why are we in Somalia?   When right across the Gulf of Aden are\n  some of the wealthiest Arab nations on the planet?  Why does the \n  US always become the point man for this stuff?   I don't mind us\n  helping out; but what invariably happens is that everybody expects\n  us to do most of the work and take most of the risks, even when these\n  events are occuring in other people's back yards, and they have the\n  resources to deal with them quite well, thank you.  I mean, it's \n  not like either Serbia, or Somalia represent some overwhelming\n  military force that their neighbors can't handle.  Nor are the \n  logistics a big deal -- it's a lot bigger logistical challenge \n  to get troops and supplies from New York to Somalia, than from \n  Saudi Arabia; harder to go from Texas to Serbia, than Turkey or \n  Austria to Serbia.
1. There is a similar idea here in ex-USSR about how many militioners it needs\n   to place a new electric lamp. The answer is nine: one stays on a table and\n   holds the lamp, four hold the table and turn it and yet four run around the\n   table in opposite direction not to make the first feel bad (when being\n   turned). Pitily, it lacks this kind of dark humour as Nick's msg does.\n2. To my mind the signature should be smth like:\n\n                  /       _                     __        /  .\n                /_______/_/_______________    /________ /____/\n         /___ /      _                  /\n\n                                          Albert
[...}\n\nLiving through those days at the age of 20 and following\nthe internal and external news gives me that knowledge\nand position.  In 1974, Turkey had a democratic goverment and free\npress at that time.  Forget about internal news agencies, I haven't\nheard anything from any international source about any\nconcentration camps with Greek Cypriot prisoners in Turkey.\nHowever, I heard Adana POW camp.  It was not secret and well \nrecognized POW camp.  \n\nI see,  They vanished in Turkish labor camps.  Turks have\ndecided to acknowledge their existence first but later\nchanged their minds releasing them.  Is that it?  What do\nyou think happened to them?  I thought that MIA's are only the subject \nof Rambo and Chuck Noris movies.  Seems that I am wrong.\n\n\nYou don't need to belive me.  Turkiye was never a clandestine state\nin its history,  It has been a respected and continuous member of UN \nsince the inception of UN.  No body ever questioned the UN membership of\nTurkey because of what had happened in 1974a and after.  Only a short \nlived arms embargo was imposed unilaterally by USA to satisfy the \ninternal Greek loby.  I know what you would say next.  Let me answer it\nbefore wasting anytime.  Yes!  UN had a few condemning resolutions \nagainst Turkey because of handling the Cyprus problem, especially after\nthe 1980 coup.  Well, US and Israel had a few too.  What can I say?\nI am sure during Athens Junta duruing 1960-74, Greeks had\ntheir own share too.\n\n\nHave you looked at the latest UN agenda for Cyprus talks\nmediated by Gali?  There was no issue whatsoever about any\nmissing people among the negotiating parties.  was there?\nI heard many times from Denktas interviews by Turkish and\nInternational press.  He keeps saying that "This was no\nlonger an issue for peace talks."  Also, you don't want\nme fish for the Greek Cypriot politician's words (that Argic\nhad posted zillion times) describing missing peoples as \na Greek-Cypriot myth.  Seems that there is a different opinions \namong Greek-Cypriots as well about missing people in Turkish \ncustody.\n\n[..]\n\n\nI am not claiming anything.  I just told you what was\ngiven to Greek Cypriots as an answer by Turkish\nGoverment/Turkish Cypriots when they wanted to locate some\nof their own between July 15 and the final cease-fire in\nlate August, 1974.  This answer seems to satisfy the international \ncommunity, the UN, and the Vasilu Goverment (since he did not make it\nan issue for the peace talks).  Also, I am not aware of any UN\ncondemnation against Turkey about any missing Greek-Cypriot.  Are you?  \n\nBTW, do you mean that Nicos Sampson had a bloodless coup d'eta\nand nobody got hurt in those events?  \n\n\nLike I said before.  There is even a different opinion among\nGreek-Cypriots for this myth.   The officers in Turkish Army who\ngoverned the Adana POW camp must be hell of clever dudes\nto cover up their tracks 8-).  I hope Turkish Army does't have \nsame type of morons for the security of Turkiye.  However, this must \na good subject for a movie script.  One should inform Oliver Stone     \nabout this.\n\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n^^^^^^^^^^^\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nIf this is what you understood from the paragraph above,\nyou better let your computer system administrator check\nthe character conversion tables in your system.  If yours are\nOK, I should inform mine 8-).

Hi Brad,\n\nI have two comments:  Regarding your hope that the "occupation will end... \nbelive that stiff resistance..etc. - how about an untried approach, i.e.,\npeace and cooperation.  I can't help but wonder what would happen if all\nviolence against Israelis stopped.  Hopefully, violence against Arabs\nwould stop at the same time.  If a state of non-violence could be \nmaintained, perhaps a state of cooperation could be achieved, i.e.,\ngreater economic opportunities for both peoples living in the\n"territories".  \n\nOf course, given the current leadership of Israel, your way may work\nalso - but if that leadership changes, e.g., to someone with Ariel\nSharon's mentality, then I would predict a considerable loss of life,\ni.e., no winners.\n\nSecondly, regarding your comment about the U.S. troops responding\nto "stiff resistance" - the analogy is not quite valid.  The U.S.\ntroops could get out of the neighborhood altogether.  The Israelis\ncould not.\n\nJust my $.02 worth, no offense intended.\n\nRespectfully,
From a recent interview in Middle East Insight magazine,\nClinton said that he supports moving the US Embassy to\nJerusalem, but would not do so at this time because it\nwould interrupt the peace talks. \n\n--\nmsilverm@nyx.cs.du.edu				GO CUBS!!!

It's hard to beat a car-bomb with a suicidal driver in getting \nright up to the target before blowing up.  Even booby-traps and\nradio-controlled bombs under cars are pretty efficient killers.  \nYou have a point.   \n\n\nIs this part of your Islamic value-system?\n\n\nHad Israeli methods been anything like this, then Iraq wouldn've been\nnuked long ago, entire Arab towns deported and executions performed by\nthe tens of thousands.  The fact is, though, that Israeli methods\naren't even 1/10,000th as evil as those which are common and everyday\nin Arab states.\n\n\n"Israeli soil"????  Brad/Ali!  Just wait until the Ayatollah's\nthought-police get wind of this.  It's all "Holy Muslim Soil (tm)".\nHave you forgotten?  May Allah have mercy on you now.
Note the clause "more forcibly", above.     My point is that they have\n  made a few pro-forma, perfunctory remarks, and sent in a few C-130's and\n  so forth, but it's clearly not something they're losing much sleep over.\n  They're just going through the motions, while Moslems are being "ethnically\n  cleansed" out of what used to be Yugoslavia.   The US has been speaking\n  out far more loudly than the Moslem nations in the UN and other world\n  forums.\n\n\n\n  Precisely.   Humanitarian concerns were not the primary justification\n  for US involvement in the Gulf - oil and geopolitics were.  If the \n  the Kuwaitis didn't have oil (and assuming Iraq still saw fit to \n  invade them) I doubt you would have seen Operation Desert Storm.
CHECK MENAHEM BEGIN DAIRIES (published book) you'll find accounts of the\n   massacres there including Deir Yassen,\n   though with the numbers of massacred men, children and women are \n   greatly minimized.\n\nAs per request of Hasan:\n\nFrom _The Revolt_, by Menachem Begin, Dell Publishing, NY, 1977:\n\n[pp. 225-227]\n\n    "Apart from the military aspect, there is a moral aspect to the\nstory of Dir Yassin. At that village, whose name was publicized\nthroughout the world, both sides suffered heavy casualties. We had\nfour killed and nearly forty wounded. The number of casualties was\nnearly forty percent of the total number of the attackers. The Arab\ntroops suffered casualties neraly three times as heavy. The fighting\nwas thus very severe. Yet the hostile propaganda, disseminated\nthroughout the world, deliberately ignored the fact that the civilian\npopulation of Dir Yassin was actually given a warning by us before the\nbattle began. One of our tenders carrying a loud speaker was stationed\nat the entrance to the village and it exhorted in Arabic all women,\nchildren and aged to leave their houses and to take shelter on the\nslopes of the hill.  By giving this humane warning our fighters threw\naway the element of complete surprise, and thus increased their own\nrisk in the ensuing battle. A substantial number of the inhabitants\nobeyed the warning and they were unhurt. A few did not leave their\nstone houses - perhaps because of the confusion. The fire of the enemy\nwas murderous - to which the number of our casualties bears eloquent\ntestimony. Our men were compelled to fight for every house; to\novercome the enemy they used large numbers of hand grenades. And the\ncivilians who had disregarded our warnings suffered inevitable\ncasualties.\n\n    "The education which we gave our soldiers throughout the years of\nrevolt was based on the observance of the traditional laws of war. We\nnever broke them unless the enemy first did so and thus forced us, in\naccordance with the accepted custom of war, to apply reprisals. I am\nconvinced, too, that our officers and men wished to avoid a single\nunnecessary casualty in the Dir Yassin battle. But those who throw\nstones of denunciation at the conquerors of Dir Yassin [1] would do\nwell not to don the cloak of hypocrisy [2].\n\n    "In connection with the capture of Dir Yassin the Jewish Agency\nfound it necessary to send a letter of apology to Abdullah, whom Mr.\nBen Gurion, at a moment of great political emotion, called 'the wise\nruler who seeks the good of his people and this country.' The 'wise\nruler,' whose mercenary forces demolished Gush Etzion and flung the\nbodies of its heroic defenders to birds of prey, replied with feudal\nsuperciliousness. He rejected the apology and replied that the Jews\nwere all to blame and that he did not believe in the existence of\n'dissidents.' Throughout the Arab world and the world at large a wave\nof lying propaganda was let loose about 'Jewish attrocities.'\n\n    "The enemy propaganda was designed to besmirch our name. In the\nresult it helped us. Panic overwhelmed the Arabs of Eretz Israel.\nKolonia village, which had previously repulsed every attack of the\nHaganah, was evacuated overnight and fell without further fighting.\nBeit-Iksa was also evacuated. These two places overlooked the main\nroad; and their fall, together with the capture of Kastel by the\nHaganah, made it possible to keep open the road to Jerusalem. In the\nrest of the country, too, the Arabs began to flee in terror, even\nbefore they clashed with Jewish forces. Not what happened at Dir\nYassin, but what was invented about Dir Yassin, helped to carve the\nway to our decisive victories on the battlefield. The legend of Dir\nYassin helped us in particular in the saving of Tiberias and the\nconquest of Haifa."\n\n\n[1] (A footnote from _The Revolt_, pp.226-7.) "To counteract the loss\nof Dir yassin, a village of strategic importance, Arab headquarters at\nRamallah broadcast a crude atrocity story, alleging a massacre by\nIrgun troops of women and children in the village. Certain Jewish\nofficials, fearing the Irgun men as political rivals, seized upon this\nArab gruel propaganda to smear the Irgun. An eminent Rabbi was induced\nto reprimand the Irgun before he had time to sift the truth. Out of\nevil, however, good came. This Arab propaganda spread a legend of\nterror amongst Arabs and Arab troops, who were seized with panic at\nthe mention of Irgun soldiers. The legend was worth half a dozen\nbattalions to the forces of Israel. The `Dir Yassin Massacre' lie\nis still propagated by Jew-haters all over the world."
Ok, someone is fundamentalist, someone else is not.\nWhat defines a fundamentalist (Not who!!!!!!!!!).\nThat is an essential question which nobody has agreed upon an answer,\nat least to what literature / discussion / news i've seen..
If a landlord sells an apartment building "vacant" to another landlord\nand fails to notify his tenants, they just might find themselves out\non the street all of a sudden.  The seller may be a scoundrel and a\ncrook but this doesn't make the buyer a "thief", as Israelis are so\noften called here on tpm.\n\n\nThe Arabs that lived along the coast in Western Palestine, later to be\ncalled Israel, were shafted by their brother Arabs just as they've\nbeen shafted for decades since then by their Arab bretheren.  Somehow,\nthough, the Arab call has continued to blame Israel, not only for the\nSyrian landowner sell-out in Western Palestine (Israel) but even for\nthe occupation of Eastern Palestine (Jordan) by the Hashemites.  This\nis just more of refusing to take blame for one's own actions.\n\n\nIf your job was eliminated in a corporate takeover, you could probably\ngo to court, too.  You'd probably lose, though.
I would like to share with netters a few points I picked up from the PBS\n    Frontline program regarding Iran's nuclear activities, aired on Tuesday\n    April 13. For the sake of brevity, I'll present them in some separate\n    points.\n\n    1- As many other western programs, this program was laid on a bed of\n    misinformation throughout the program, to maximize the effect of the\n    program on the viewer. Some of the misinformations were as follows:\n\n    - It was alleged that:" Late Imam Khomeini objected to Shah's technological\n    advancements as anti-Islamic, but now things have changed and the proof of\n    change is that some Iranian merchants are now selling personal computers. "!\n    These are the most ridiculous lies, one can make about the objectives \n    of the Islamic Revolution in toppling the Shah and state of the technology\n    in Iran after revolution.\n\n    -Iran was equally accused of using chemical weapons against Iraqi aggressors\n    while there has never been any proof in this regard, and nobody has seen\n    Iraqi soldiers or civilians injured by Iranian chemical weapons, in\n    contrary to what the whole world has seen about Iranian soldiers and\n    civilians, injured by Iraqi chemical weapons.\n\n    - While the number of martyrs during the sacred defense against Iraqi\n    aggression has been officially announced to be about 117,000 and even most\n    radical counter-revolutionary groups claim that Iran and Iraq had a total\n    of one million dead, this program claims that Iran alone has one million\n    dead left from the war.\n\n    - The translation of Iranian officials' talks are not 100% true. For\n    example when Iranian head of Atomic Energy says that: " It hurts me to\n    see that Iran is the subject of these unfriendly propaganda." The \n    research."!\n\n    2- Almost all alleged devices or material bought or planned to be bought\n    by Iranians were of countless dual usage, while the program tries to \n    undermine their non-military uses, without any reference to Iran's\n    big population and its inevitable need to other sources of energy in\n    near future and its current deficit in electrical power.\n\n    3- The whole program is trying to show the Sharif University of \n    Technology as a nuclear research center, while even the cameramen of the\n    program know well that in a country like Iran without a so tightly closed\n    society no one can make a nuclear bomb in a university! Taking in account\n    the scientific advancement of Sharif U. in engineering fields and its\n    potential role in improvement of Iran's industries and eventually the\n    lives of people, it is obvious that they are persuading other countries\n    to prevent them from further helping this university or other ones\n    in scientific and industrial efforts.\n\n    4- A key point in program's justifications is trying to disvalidate as\n    much as possible all efforts done by IAEA [*] in their numerous visits from\n    Iran's different sites. They say: "We are not sure if the places visited\n    by IAEA are the real ones or not" !, or " We can not rely on IAEA's\n    reports and observation, because they failed to see Iraq's nuclear\n    activities before" as if they didn't know that Iraq was trying to build\n    nuclear weapons!\n\n    5- As an extremely personal opinion, the most disgusting aspect of the\n    program was the arrogance of the member of US Senate foreign Affairs,\n    William Triplet, in his way of talking, as if he was the god talking\n    from the absolute knowledge!\n\n       I hope all Iranians be aware of the gradual buildup against their\n    country in western media, and I hope Iranian authorities continue to\n    their wise and calculated approach with regard to international affairs\n    and peaceful coexistence with friendly nations.\n\n\nMohammad

The investment was there in the form of huge tax breaks, and employer\nbenfits.  You are overlooking the difference that these could have\nmade to any company.  Part of the problem was that few industries\nwere interested in political settling, as much as profit.\n\n\nTrue, which leads to the obvious question, should any investment have\nbeen made there at the taxpayer's expense.  Obviously, the answer was\nand still is a resounding no.
Avi,\n   For your information, Islam permits freedom of religion - there is\nno compulsion in religion.  Does Judaism permit freedom of religion\n(i.e. are non-Jews recognized in Judaism).  Just wondering.
Yes. As long as the goverment over there can force some authority and prevent\nterrorists attack against Israel. \n\n\nSinai had several big cities that were avcuated when isreal gave it back to\nEgypth, but for a peace agreement. So it is my opinin that the settlers will not\nbe an obstacle for withdrawal as long it is combined with a real peace agreement\nwith the Arabs and the Palastinians.\n\n\n\nNaftaly
There are many neutral human rights organizations which always report\non the situation in the O.T.  But, as most people used to see on TV, the\nIsraelis do not allow them to go deep there in the O.T.  The Israelis \nused to arrest and sometimes to kill some of these neutral reporters.  \nSo, this is another kind of terrorism committed by the Jews in Palestine.\nThey do not allow fair and neutral coverage of the situation in Palestine.
Only Brendan McKay, or maybe ARF, would come to the rescue of Nazi\nracial theory.  Is it distressing Brendan?  The point is that any\neugenic solution to the Jewish Problem as Elias has proposed smacks\nof pure Nazism.  The fact that Elias' proposal cast the entire "problem"\nas one of the abnormal presence of Israeli society in the Middle East,\nand that he buried a slam against U.S. aid to Israel in the midst of\nhis "even-handed" solution of the Jewish Question, made it obvious what \nhe had in mind: disolving the Jewish polity.  That *is* a Nazi doctrine:\nrectification of the "abnormal presence" of the Jewish people within a \nlarger body politic.  Whether your "solution" involves gas, monetary \nincentives to the poor Jews to marry out, or as Feisal Husseini has \nsaid, "disolve the Zionist entity by forcing it to engage the normal \nsurrounding Arab culture," you are engaged in a Nazi project.\n\nJust as obvious is your statement: "I will not comment on the value\nor lack of value of Elias's proposal."  Still striking the glancing\nblow, right Brendan?  You could easily see where he was going, but you\n"will not comment."  So, you are complicitous.\n\nWhat is your fascination with Nazi racial theory, anyway?\n\n-- Chris Metcalfe ("someone else")\n\n!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
[FARID] In support of the preservation of the territorial integrity of \n[FARID] Azerbaijan and its independence from Russian rule, the Iranians which \n[FARID] includes millions of Azerbaijanis will have Armenia retreat from the \n[FARID] territory of Azerbaijan. \n\nOh, they will? This should prove quite interesting!\n\n[FARID] To count on Iranian help to supposedly counter Turkish influence will \n[FARID] be a fatal error on the part of Armenia as long as Armenia in \n[FARID] violation of international law has Azerbaijani lands in occupation. \n\nArmenia is not counting on Iranian help. As far as violations of international\nlaws, which international law gives Azerbaijan the right to attack and \ndepopulate the Armenians in Karabakh?\n\n[FARID] If Armenian aggression continues in the territory of Azerbaijan, not \n[FARID] only there won't be any aid from Iran to Armenia but also steps will \n[FARID] be taken to have Armenian army back in Armenia. \n\nAnd who do you speak for? Rafsanjani?\n\n[FARID] The Azerbaijanis of Iran will be the guarantors of this policy. As for \n[FARID] scaring Iranians or Turks from the Russian power, experts on present \n[FARID] and future military potentials of these people would not put much \n[FARID] stock on the Russain power as the sole power in the region for long!!! \n\nWell, Farid, your supposed experts are not expert! The Russians have had\nnon-stop influence in the Caucasus since the Treaty of Turkmanchay in 1828.\nHmm... that makes it 1993-1828 = 165 years! \n\nOh, I see the Azeris from Iran are going to force out the Armenians from \nKarabakh! That will be a real good trick! \n\n[FARID] Iran is not alian to developing the capability to produce the A bomb \n[FARID] and a reliable delivery system (refer to recent news releases \n[FARID] regarding the potential of Iran). \n\nSo the Azeris from Iran are going to force the Armenians from Karabakh by\nforcing the Iranian government to drop an atomic bomb on these Armenians.\n\n[FARID] The moral of the story is that, you don't go invading your neighbor's \n[FARID] home (Azerbaijan) and flash Russia's guns when questioned about it. \n\nOh, but it's just fine if you drop an atomic bomb on your neighbor! You are\na damn fool, Farid!\n\n[FARID] (Marshal Shapashnikov may have to eat his words regarding Turkey in a \n[FARID] few short years!). \n\nSo you are going to drop an atomic bomb on Russia as well. \n\n[FARID] Peaceful resolution of the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict is the only \n[FARID] way to go. Armenia may soon find the fruits of Aggression very bitter \n[FARID] indeed.\n\nAnd the Armenians will take your "peaceful" dropping of an atomic bomb as\nan example of Iranian Azeri benevolence! You sir are a poor example of an \nIranian Azeri! \n\nHa! And to think I had a nice two day stay in Tabriz back in 1978!
[h] 	The Armenians in Nagarno-Karabagh are simply DEFENDING their RIGHTS\n[h]        to keep their homeland and it is the AZERIS that are INVADING their \n[h]        territorium...\n	\n[HE]	Homeland? First Nagarno-Karabagh was Armenians homeland today\n[HE]	Fizuli, Lacin and several villages (in Azerbadjan)\n[HE]	are their homeland. Can't you see the\n[HE]	the  "Great Armenia" dream in this?\n\nGreater Armenia would stretch from Karabakh, to the Black Sea, to the\nMediterranean, so if you use the term "Greater Armenia" use it with care.\n\n[HE]    With facist methods like\n[HE]	killing, raping and bombing villages. The last move was the \n[HE]	blast of a truck with 60 kurdish refugees, trying to\n[HE]	escape the from Lacin, a city that was "given" to the Kurds\n[HE]	by the Armenians. \n\nIt has always been up to the Azeris to end their announced winning of Karabakh \nby removing the Armenians! When the president of Azerbaijan, Elchibey, came to \npower last year, he announced he would be be "swimming in Lake Sevan [in \nArmeniaxn] by July". Well, he was wrong! If Elchibey is going to shell the \nArmenians of Karabakh from Aghdam, his people will pay the price! If Elchibey \nis going to shell Karabakh from Fizuli his people will pay the price! If \nElchibey thinks he can get away with bombing Armenia from the hills of \nKelbajar, his people will pay the price. \n\nIt also seems other non-Azeri minorities in Azerbaijan have understood they\nare next in line in this process of forced Azerification or deportation. Just \nlook at the situation with the Lezgians.\n\nAbout the Kurds...what Kurds! According to the Azerbaijani government, there \nare no Kurds in Azerbaijan. Can't they make up their minds? Oh I see, there \nare only Kurds when the Azeris want them to be Kurds! And anyway, this "60 \nKurd refugee" story, as have other stories, are simple fabrications sourced in \nBaku, modified in Ankara. Other examples of this are Armenia has no border \nwith Iran, and the ridiculous story of the "intercepting" of Armenian military \nconversations as appeared in the New York Times supposedly translated by \nsomebody unknown, from Armenian into Azeri Turkish, submitted by an unnamed \n"special correspondent" to the NY Times from Baku. Real accurate!\n\n[h]       However, I hope that the Armenians WILL force a TURKISH airplane \n[h]       to LAND for purposes of SEARCHING for ARMS similar to the one\n[h]       that happened last SUMMER. Turkey searched an AMERICAN plane\n[h]       (carrying humanitarian aid) bound to ARMENIA.\n[h]\n\nNo, Henrik, these Turkish planes should be shot down with no questions asked.\n\n[HE]	Don't speak about things you don't know: 8 American Cargo planes\n[HE]	were heading to Armenia. When the Turkish authorities\n[HE]	announced that they were going to search these cargo \n[HE]	planes 3 of these planes returned to it's base in Germany.\n[HE]	5 of these planes were searched in Turkey. The content of\n[HE]	of the other 3 planes? Not hard to guess, is it? It was sure not\n[HE]	humanitarian aid.....\n\nYour "facts" in error. Shipments of all kinds that have transversed Turkey \nhave been either searched, re-routed or confiscated. Some American planes\nwere searched, others were re-routed, others were untouched. Rail shipments \nwere held up last fall and last winter from entering Armenian from Turkey\nfor the purpose of aiding in the economic collapse of Armenia. Wheat was\nconfiscated, other shipments were exchanged with "crap" and dirt, then\nshipped to Armenia. U.S. planes don't have to use Turkish air bases. The U.S.\nuses these bases to bomb Iraq. Anyway, U.S. planes can fly over Georgia, which\nthey have found is easier than to endure unnecessary expressions of Turkish \nchauvinism through searches of cargo which to this day have not revealed \nanything other than a paranoid Turkish military. \n\n[HE]	Search Turkish planes?

No wonder you are so confused!\n\n[HE]	Turkey's government has announced that it's giving weapons\n[HE]	to Azerbadjan since Armenia started to attack Azerbadjan\n[HE]	it self, not the Karabag province. So why search a plane for weapons\n[HE]	since it's content is announced to be weapons? \n\nYou are correct, all Turkish planes should be simply shot down! Nice, slow\nmoving air transports!
I know it doesn't make sense, but since when is 'Napoleon' about\nsense, anyway? Further striking bigoted and racist attitude of \ncertain Greeks still exists in our day. Most Greeks insist even \ntoday, that the 537 year-old capital of the Ottoman Empire should \nbe called not by its rightful name of Istanbul, but by its half \na millennium-old moniker 'Cons*(whatever).'\n\nEveryone knows that New York City was once called 'New Amsterdam'\nbut Dutch people do not persist on calling it that today. The name \nof Stalingrad too is long gone, replaced by Volgagrad. China's\nPeking traded its name for Beiging long ago. Ciudad Trujillo\nof the Dominican Republic is now Santa Domingo. Zimbabve's\nold colonial capital Salisburry became Harrare. These changes\nhave all been accepted officially by everyone in the world.\n\nBut, Greeks are still determined on calling the Turkish Istanbul \nby the name of 'Cons*.'\n\nHow can one explain this total intransigence? What makes Greeks\nso different from other mortals? 18-year-old questionable\ndemocracy? Why don't they seem to reconcile with the fact,\nfor instance, that Istanbul changed hands 537 years ago in\n1453 AD, and that this predates the discovery of the New \nWorld, by 39 years. The declaration of U.S. independence\nin 1776 will come 284 years later.\n\nShouldn't then, half a millennium be considered enough time for \n'Cons*' to be called a Turkish city? Where is the logic in the \nGreek reasoning, if there is any? How long can one sit on the \nlaurels of an ancient civilization? Ancient Greece does not exist, \nany more than any other 16 civilizations that existed on the soil \nof Anatolia.\n\nThese undereducated 'wieneramus' live with an illusion. It \nis the same mentality which allows them to rationalize\nthat Cyprus is a Greek Island. No history book shows\nthat it ever was. It belonged to the Ottoman Turks 'lock,\nstock and barrel' for a period of well over 300 years.\n\nIn fact, prior to the Turks' acquisition of it, following\nbloody naval battles with the Venetians in 1570 AD, the\nisland of Cyprus belonged, invariably, to several nations:\n\nThe Assyrians, the Sumerians, the Phoenicians, the Egyptians,\nthe Ottoman Turks, of course in that order, owned it as \ntheir territory. But, it has never been the possession\nof the government of Greece - not even for one day -\nin the history of the world. Moreover, Cyprus is\nlocated 1500 miles from the Greek mainland, but only \n40 miles from Turkiye's southern coastline.\n\nSaddam Hussein claims that Kuwait was once Iraqi\nterritory and the Greek Cypriot government and \nthe terrorist Greek governments think that Cyprus\nalso was once part of the Greek hegemony.\n\nThose 'Arromdians' involved in this grandiose hallucination\nshould wake up from their sweet daydreams and confront \nreality. Again, wishful thinking is unproductive, only \nfacts count.\n\nAs for Selanik,\n\n  <<Those Jews who survived these assaults in Southeastern Europe fled\n  particularly to Salonica, whose Jewish population increased substantially\n  as a result, from 28,000 in 1876 to 90,000 in 1908, more than half the\n  total population, though even there increased persecution by local Greeks\n  led many Jews to flee elsewhere in the Ottoman Empire, particularly to\n  the great port of Izmir.\n\n  Despite all the pressure from Ottomans and foreign Jews alike, the ritual\n  murders and other assaults by Christians on Jews went on and on. Greek\n  efforts to decimate the Jewish population of Salonica culminated in 1912\n  and 1913, following Greek conquest of Salonica during the first Balkan War,\n  when many of its Jews, were either killed or terrorized into leaving...>>\n\n  <<Though Greece was obligated by the post World War I treaties to allow\n  Jews and other minorities to use their own languages in education and to\n  practice their religions without hindrance, a law was issued in 1923\n  which forbad all inhabitants from working on Sunday, stimulating a new\n  Jewish exodus as it was intended to do. Between 1932 and 1934 there was a\n  series of anti-Semitic riots in Salonica, with the Cambel quarter, where\n  most of the remaining Jews lived, being burned to the ground. This\n  was followed by regulations requiring the use of Greek and prohibiting\n  Hebrew and Judea-Spanish in the Jewish schools. A start was made also\n  on expropriating the land of the principal Jewish cemetery in Salonica\n  for use by the new University in order to derive the Jews out [47]. By\n  killing and driving out large numbers of Jews, the Greeks left a\n  substantial Greek majority in the city for the first time, and starting\n  Salonica Jewry on the way to its final decimation by the Nazis during the\n  occupation of Greece starting in 1941.\n\n  Salonica and Izmir of course were not the only places of refuge for\n  Jewish refugees entering the Empire during its last century of existence.\n  Istanbul, Edirne, and other parts of Rumelia and Anatolia received\n  thousands more. Nor were Jews the only refugees received and helped by\n  the government of the Sultan. Thousands of Muslims accompanied them in\n  flight from similar persecutions wherever Balkan christian states gained\n  independence or expanded. The Russian conquest of the Crimea and the\n  Caucasus starting in the late eighteenth century, and particularly during\n  and after the Crimean War, combined with the same independence movements\n  in Southeastern Europe that had caused so much suffering and flight among\n  its Jews caused thousands of helpless, ill, and poverty-stricken Muslim\n  refugees to accompany them into the ever shrinking boundaries of the\n  Ottoman Empire, with the Istanbul government struggling mightly but vainly\n  to house and feed them as best it could. From 1850 to 1864 as many as\n  800,000 Crimean Tatars, Circassians, and other Muslims from north and\n  east of the Black Sea had entered Anatolia alone, as many as 200,000 more\n  came during the next twenty years, while 474,389 refugees entered in 1876-\n  1877 as a result of the Ottoman wars with Russia and the Balkan states,\n  with an equal number gaining refuge in the European portions of the\n  Empire.>>\n\n[47] Robert Mantran, 'La structure sociale de la communaute juive de\n  Salonqiue a la fin du dix-neuvieme siecle', RH no.534 (1980), 391-92;\n  Nehama VII, 762; Joseph Nehama (Salonica) to AIU (Paris) no.2868/2,\n  12 May 1903 (AIU Archives I-C-43); and no.2775, 10 January 1900 (AIU\n  Archives I-C-41), describing daily battles between Jewish and Greek\n  children in the streets of Salonica.

Oh, why do you expose your ignorance?  The US has been running on debt for \nthe past four generations and has still financed what it pleases.\n\nAnd after the Gulf War, Israel could do whatever it wanted after\nnot decimating Iraq after the Scud attacks.  It was encouraged, but\nby no means forced, to negotiate.\n\nMr. Baker, to address all of your points would be impossible, but in a \nnutshell, it is hypocritical for you to attack Israel's presence in\nLebanon without attacking Syria.  Syrian occupation has been hostile,\nand amounts to annexation.  Israel's is clearly defensive.  If it \nwere not defensive, you would see all of Lebanon occupied, and governed by\nIsrael.  But that is not what Israel wants.

What the hell do you know about Israeli policy?  What gives you the fiat\nto look into the minds of Israeli generals?  Has this 'policy of intimidation'\nbeen published somewhere?  For your information, the actions taken by Arabs,\nspecifically the PLO, were not uncommon in the Lebanon Campaign of 1982.  My\nbrain is full of shit?  At least I don't look into the minds of others and \nmake Israeli policy for them!\n\n\nYeah, yeah, yeah.  We all suffer.  It's too bad that civilians get killed but\nI will blame their Arab leaders who put them in positions of danger before I\nwill blame the Israelis.  Just like Palestinians who send their children into\nwarzones to throw rocks at armed Israeli soldiers.  What irresponsible parents!\nAs Golda Meir said, peace will only come when the Arabs start loving their\nchildren more than they hate the Jews.
How do you define war?  Do seiges and constant attacks on villiages\ncount as acts of war, or is that only when the Jews do them?\nJanuary, 1948: Arab Liberation Army attacks Kfar Szold\n               1000 men attack Kfar Etzion, 14 miles south of Jerusalem,\n                    after cutting off the supply lines to it.\nAttacks on Yehiam (Western Galilee) and kibbutz Tirat Tzvi.\nBy Mid-March, The Jewish settlements in the Negev had been cut off from\n      land links with the rest of the Jewish population.\n         The Etzion group of villiages, near Hebron, had been cut off,\n            while 42 members of a convoy trying to supply Yehiam were\n            slaughtered, cutting off the villiage.\nJerusalem was under seige, being cut off from its supply route from\n     Tel Aviv (the bombed out supply trucks have been left on the side\n     of that road to this day in memoriam).  By this time, 1200 Jews \n     had been killed.\n\nOf course, this isn't war, since it's only the Arabs attacking.\nJust like last week when the Fatah launched Katyusha rockets\nagainst Northern israel.  Where does uprising end and war begin?\nWill it still be 'Intifadah' when the PLO brings in tanks?
Andy Beyer has claimed that the Israeli Press is a bit biased.\nBut the fact is that there are events shaping the politics of the\nmideast that people who do not read the Israeli press simply know\nnothing about.  Many of these events are not even mentioned here.\nI read the Israeli press to learn of important events about which\nyou know nothing, because of your total reliance on western media\nfor your information on Israel.  Since I read both American media\nand Israeli media, I can say with absolute certainty that anybody\nwho reliesx exclusively on the American press for knowledge about\nIsrael does not have a true picture of what is going on.
# Well said Mr. Beyer :)\n\nHe-he. The great humanist speaks. One has to read Mr. Salah's posters,\nin which he decribes Jews as "sons of pigs and monkeys", keeps\npromising the "final battle" between Muslims and Jews (in which the\nstons and the trees will "cry for the Muslims to come and kill the\nJews hiding behind them"), makes jokes about Jews dying from heart\nattacks etc, to realize his objective stance on the matters involved.
THE HAMAS WAY of DEATH\n \n     (Following is a transcript of a recruitment and training\nvideotape made last summer by the Qassam Battalions, the military\narm of Hamas, an Islamic Palestinian group. Hamas figures\nsignificantly in the Middle East equation. In December, Israel\ndeported more than 400 Palestinians to Lebanon in response to\nHamas's kidnapping and execution of an Israeli soldier. A longer\nversion appears in the May issue of Harper's Magazine, which\nobtained and translated the tape.)\n \n     My name is Yasir Hammad al-Hassan Ali. I live in Nuseirat [a\nrefugee camp in the Gaza Strip]. I was born in 1964. I finished\nhigh school, then attended Gaza Polytechnic. Later, I went to work\nfor Islamic University in Gaza as a clerk. I'm married and I have\ntwo daughters.\n     The Qassam Battalions are the only group in Palestine\nexplicitly dedicated to jihad [holy war]. Our primary concern is\nPalestinians who collaborate with the enemy. Many young men and\nwomen have fallen prey to the cunning traps laid by the [Israeli]\nSecurity Services.\n     Since our enemies are trying to obliterate our nation,\ncooperation with them is clearly a terrible crime. Our most\nimportant objective must be to put an end to the plague of\ncollaboration. To do so, we abduct collaborators, intimidate and\ninterrogate them in order to uncover other collaborators and expose\nthe methods that the enemy uses to lure Palestinians into\ncollaboration in the first place. In addition to that, naturally,\nwe confront the problem of collaborators by executing them.\n     We don't execute every collaborator. After all, about 70\npercent of them are innocent victims, tricked or black-mailed into\ntheir misdeeds. The decision whether to execute a collaborator is\nbased on the seriousness of his crimes. If, like many\ncollaborators, he has been recruited as an agent of the Israeli\nBorder Guard then it is imperative that he be executed at once.\nHe's as dangerous as an Israeli soldier, so we treat him like an\nIsraeli soldier.\n     There's another group of collaborators who perform an even\nmore loathsome role -- the ones who help the enemy trap young men\nand women in blackmail schemes that force them to become\ncollaborators. I regard the "isqat" [the process by which a\nPalestinians is blackmailed into collaboration] of single person as\ngreater crime than the killing of a demonstrator. If someone is\nguilty of causing repeated cases of isqat, than it is our religious\nduty to execute him.\n     A third group of collaborators is responsible for the\ndistribution of narcotics. They work on direct orders from the\nSecurity Services to distribute drugs as widely as possible. Their\nvictims become addicted and soon find it unbearable to quit and\nimpossible to afford more. They collaborate in order to get the\ndrugs they crave. The dealers must also be executed.\n     In the battalions, we have developed a very careful method of\nuncovering collaborators, We can't afford to abduct an innocent\nperson, because once we seize a person his reputation is tarnished\nforever. We will abduct and interrogate a collaborator only after\nevidence of his guilt has been established -- never before. If\nafter interrogation the collaborator is found guilty beyond any\ndoubt, then he is executed.\n     In many cases, we don't have to make our evidence against\ncollaborators public, because everyone knows that they're guilty.\nBut when the public isn't aware that a certain individual is a\ncollaborator, and we accuse him, people are bound to ask for\nevidence. Many people will proclaim his innocence, so there must be\nirrefutable proof before he is executed. This proof is usually\nobtained in the form of a confession.\n     At first, every collaborator denies his crimes. So we start\noff by showing the collaborator the testimony against him. We tell\nhim that he still has a chance to serve his people, even in the\nlast moment of his life, by confessing and giving us the\ninformation we need.\n     We say that we know his repentance in sincere and that he has\nbeen a victim. That kind of talk is convincing. Most of them\nconfess after that. Others hold out; in those cases, we apply\npressure, both psychological and physical. Then the holdouts\nconfess as well.\n     Only one collaborator has ever been executed without an\ninterrogation. In that case, the collaborator had been seen working\nfor the Border Guard since before the intifada, and he himself\nconfessed his involvement to a friend, who disclosed the\ninformation to us. In addition, three members of his network of\ncollaborators told us that he had caused their isqat. With this\nmuch evidence, there was no need to interrogate him. But we are\nvery careful to avoid wrongful executions. In every case, our\nprincipal is the same: the accused should be interrogated until he\nhimself confesses his crimes. \n     A few weeks ago, we sat down and complied a list of\ncollaborators to decide whether there were any who could be\nexecuted without interrogation. An although we had hundreds of\nnames, still, because of our fear of God and of hell, we could not\nmark any of these men, except for the one I just mentioned, for\nexecution.\n     When we execute a collaborator in public, we use a gun. But\nafter we abduct and interrogate a collaborator, we can't shoot him\n-- to do so might give away our locations. That's why collaborators\nare strangled. Sometimes we ask the collaborator, "What do you\nthink? How should we execute you?" One collaborator told us,\n"Strangle me." He hated the sight of blood.
Bullshit.  You've been in Iceland for the past 30 years.  You told us\nso yourself.  It had something to do with not wanting to suffer the\nfate of your mother, who has lived with Jews for a long time or\nsomesuch.  Sounded awful.\n\n\nAre you as concerned about peace and justice in Palestine (Jordan)?\n\n\nLet's say that Israel grants the PLO _EVERYTHING THEY EVER ASKED FOR_.\nThat Israel goes back to the 1967 borders.  What will the "Palestinean\nArabs" in Tel-Aviv call themselves?  The Palestineans in West\nJerusalem?  In Haifa?  Will they still claim to be "occupied"?\n\nOr do you suggest that Israel expell or kill off any remaining Arabs,\nmuch as the Arabs did to their Jews?\n\nIndeed, there is much which is not symmetrical about the conflict in\nthe M.E.  And most of this lack of symmetry does NOT favor Israel.

As \n the door swung shut behind me I saw they came from a man's body lying face \n up, naked but for its grimy turban. He was about fifty years old by what \n was left of his face - a rifle butt had bashed an eye. The one left slanted, \n as with Tartars rather than with Turks. Any uniform once on him was gone, so \n I'd no proof which he was, and quickly went out, gagging at the mess of his  \n slashed genitals."\n\np. 363 (first paragraph). \n\n 'How many people lived there?'\n 'Oh, about eight hundred.' He yawned.\n 'Did you see any Turk officers?'\n 'No, sir. I was in at dawn. All were Tartar civilians in mufti.'\n\n "The lieutenant dozed off, then I, but in the small hours a voice woke me - \n Dro's. He stood in the starlight bawling out an officer. Anyone keelhauled\n so long and furiously I'd never heard. Then abruptly Dro broke into \n laughter, quick and simple as child's. Both were a cover for his sense\n of guilt, I thought, or hoped. For somehow, despite my boast of irreligion,\n Christian massacring 'infidels' was more horrible than the reverse would\n have been.\n\n From daybreak on, Armenian villagers poured in from miles around.....\n The women plundered happily, chattering like ravens as they picked over\n the carcass of Djul. They hauled out every hovel's chattels, the last \n scrap of food or cloth, and staggered away, packing pots, saddlebags, \n looms, even spinning-wheels.\n\n 'Thank you for a lot, Dro,' I said to him back in camp. 'But now I must \n leave.'...We shook hands, the captain said 'A bientot, mon camarade.' And \n for hours the old Molokan scout and I plodded north across parching plains. \n Like Lot's wife I looked back once to see smoke bathing all, doubtless in \n a sack of other Moslem villages up to the line of snow that was Iran.'"\n\np. 354.\n\n"At morning tea, Dro and his officers spread out a map of this whole\n high region called the Karabakh. Deep in tactics, they spoke Russian,\n but I got their contempt for Allied 'neutral' zones and their distrust\n of promises made by tribal chiefs. A campaign shaped; more raids on\n Moslem villages."\n\np. 358.\n\n"It will be three hours to take," Dro told me. We'd close in on three\n sides.\n"The men on foot will not shoot, but use only the bayonets," Merrimanov\nsaid, jabbing a rifle in dumbshow.\n"That is for morale," Dro put in. "We must keep the Moslems in terror."\n"Soldiers or civilians?" I asked.\n"There is no difference," said Dro. "All are armed, in uniform or not."\n"But the women and children?"\n"Will fly with the others as best they may."\n\np. 360.\n\n"The ridges circled a wide expanse, its floors still. Hundreds of feet \n down, the fog held, solid as cotton flock. 'Djul lies under that,' said \n Dro, pointing. 'Our men also attack from the other sides.'\n\n Then, 'Whee-ee!' - his whistle lined up all at the rock edge. Bayonets\n clicked upon carbines. Over plunged Archo, his black haunches rippling;\n then followed the staff, the horde - nose to tail, bellies taking the\n spur. Armenia in action seemed more like a pageant than war, even though \n I heard our Utica brass roar.\n\n As I watched from the height, it took ages for Djul to show clear. A tsing\n of machine-gun fire took over from the thumping batteries; cattle lowed,\n dogs barked, invisible, while I ate a hunk of cheese and drank from a snow\n puddle. Mist at last folded upward as men shouted, at first heard faintly.\n The came a shrill wailing.\n\n Now among the cloud-streaks rose darker wisps - smoke. Red glimmered about\n house walls of stone or wattle, into dry weeds on roofs. A mosque stood in\n clump of trees, thick and green. Through crooked alleys on fire, horsemen\n were galloping after figures both mounted and on foot.\n\n 'Tartarski!' shouted the gunner by me. Others pantomimed them in escape\n over the rocks, while one twisted a bronze shell-nose, loaded, and yanked\n breech-cord, firing again and again. Shots wasted, I thought, when by\n afternoon I looked in vain for fallen branch or body. But these shots and\n the white bursts of shrapnel in the gullies drowned the women's cries.\n\n At length all shooting petered out. I got on my horse and rode down toward\n Djul. It burned still but little flame showed now. The way was steep and \n tough, through dense scrub. Finally on flatter ground I came out suddenly,\n through alders, on smoldering houses. Across trampled wheat my brothers-in-\n arms were leading off animals, several calves and a lamb."\n\np. 361 (fourth paragraph).\n\n"Corpses came next, the first a pretty child with straight black hair, \n large eyes. She looked about twelve years old. She lay in some stubble \n where meal lay scattered from the sack she'd been toting. The bayonet \n had gone through her back, I judged, for blood around was scant. Between \n the breasts one clot, too small for a bullet wound, crusted her homespun \n dress.\n\n The next was a boy of ten or less, in rawhide jacket and knee-pants. He \n lay face down in the path by several huts. One arm reached out to the \n pewter bowl he'd carried, now upset upon its dough. Steel had jabbed \n just below his neck, into the spine. \n\n There were grownups, too, I saw as I led the sorrel around. Djul was \n empty of the living till I looked up to see beside me Dro's German-speaking \n colonel. He said all Tartars who had not escaped were dead."\n\np. 358.\n\n "...more stories of Armenian murdering Turks when the czarist troops fled\n  north.

Absolutely. I'm sure that civilians on both sides would be pleased\nif the fighters (military, guerilla, whatever) would just take their\nargument elsewhere, find an unpopulated area somewhere, and slug it out.  \nAt that point, we will all breath a sigh of relief *and* cheer for\nour side in the struggle.

Hey Serdar,\n           What are you retarded?
Oh yeah, Israel was really ready to "expand its borders" on the holiest day\nof the year (Yom Kippur) when the Arabs attacked in 1973.  Oh wait, you\nchose to omit that war...perhaps because it 100% supports the exact \nOPPOSITE to the point you are trying to make?  I don't think that it's\nbecause it was the war that hit Israel the hardest.  Also, in 1967 it was\nEgypt, not Israel who kicked out the UN force.  In 1948 it was the Arabs\nwho refused to accept the existance of Israel BASED ON THE BORDERS SET\nBY THE UNITED NATIONS.  In 1956, Egypt closed off the Red Sea to Israeli\nshipping, a clear antagonistic act.  And in 1982 the attack was a response\nto years of constant shelling by terrorist organizations from the Golan\nHeights.  Children were being murdered all the time by terrorists and Israel\nfinally retaliated.  Nowhere do I see a war that Israel started so that \nthe borders could be expanded.\n \n   Steve\n--

ADL authorities seem to view a lot of people as dangerous, including\nthe millions of Americans of Arab ancestry.  Perhaps you can answer\nthe question as to why the ADL maintained files and spied on ADC members\nin California (and elsewhere??)?  Friendly rivalry perhaps?\n\nPerhaps Yigal is a Greenpeace member?

The wars of 1948, 1956, 1967, 1978 were definitely started by the Arabs.\nThe war in 1982 was instigated by the Arabs who continually murdered\nIsraeli children with their rocket attacks.  Israel was only trying to\nstop this.  \nLast what the heck are you talking about with "1968 (Karama)"?  There was \nno war in 1968!  \n\n   Steve\n--

It seems to me that many readers of this conference are interested\nwho is behind the Center for Polict Research. I will oblige.\n\nMy name is Elias Davidsson, Icelandic citizen, born in Palestine. My\nmother was thrown from Germany because she belonged to the 'undesirables'\n(at that times this group was defined as 'Jews'). She was forced to go\nto Palestine due to many  cynical factors. I have meanwhile settled in\nIceland (30 years ago) and met many people who were thrown out from\nmy homeland, Palestine, because of the same reason (they belonged to\nthe 'indesirables'). These people include my neighbors in Jerusalem\nwith the children of whom I played as child. Their crime: Theyare\nnot Jews. My conscience does not accept such injustice, period. My\nwork for justice is done in the name of my principled opposition to racism\nand racial discrimination. Those who protest against such practices\nin Arab countries have my support - as long as their protest is based\non a principled position, but not as a tactic to deflect criticism\nfrom Israel. The struggle against discrimination and racism is universal.\n\nThe Center for Policy Research is a name I gave to those activities\nundertaken under my guidance in different domains, and which command\nthe support of many volunteers in Iceland. It is however not a formal\ninstitution and works with minimal funds.\n\nProfessionally I am music teacher and composer. I have published \nseveral pieces and my piano music is taught widely in Europe.\n\nI would hope that discussion about Israel/Palestine be conducted in\na more civilized manner. Calling names is not helpful.
A delightful message, interesting, and so kindly written.  Thanks.
So, did the Jews kill the Germans? \nYou even make Armenians laugh.\n\n"An appropriate analogy with the Jewish Holocaust might be the\n systematic extermination of the entire Muslim population of \n the independent republic of Armenia which consisted of at \n least 30-40 percent of the population of that republic. The \n memoirs of an Armenian army officer who participated in and \n eye-witnessed these atrocities was published in the U.S. in\n 1926 with the title 'Men Are Like That.' Other references abound."\n     (Rachel A. Bortnick - The Jewish Times - June 21, 1990)\n\n\nYes.

The estimated population\n of the entire region in 1886 was 4,700,000, of whom 940,000 (20 percent) were\n Armenian, 1,200,000 (25 percent) Georgian, and 2,220,000 (45 percent) Moslem.\n Of the latter group, 1,140,000 were Tatars. Paradoxically, barely one-third\n of Transcaucasia's Armenians lived in the Erevan guberniia, where the \n Christians constituted a majority in only three of the seven uezds. Erevan\n uezd, the administrative center of the province, had only 44,000 Armenians\n as compared to 68,000 Moslems. By the time of the Russian Census of 1897,\n however, the Armenians had established a scant majority, 53 percent, in the\n guberniia; it had risen by 1916 to 60 percent, or 670,000 of the 1,120,000\n inhabitants. This impressive change in the province's ethnic character \n notwithstanding, there was, on the eve of the creation of the Armenian \n Republic, a solid block of 370,000 Tartars who continued to dominate the \n southern districts, from the outskirts of Ereven to the border of Persia." \n (See also Map 1.

Our troops surrounded village after village. \n Little resistance was offered. Our artillery knocked the huts \n into heaps of stone and dust and when the villages became untenable \n and inhabitants fled from them into fields, bullets and bayonets \n completed the work. Some of the Tartars escaped of course. They \n found refuge in the mountains or succeeded in crossing the border \n into Turkey. The rest were killed. And so it is that the whole \n length of the borderland of Russian Armenia from Nakhitchevan to \n Akhalkalaki from the hot plains of Ararat to the cold mountain \n plateau of the North were dotted with mute mournful ruins of \n Tartar villages.

[stuff deleted]\n\n\nGimme a break.  CAPITAL letters, or NOT, the above is pure nonsense.  It\nseems to me that short sighted Armenians are escalating the hostilities\nwhile hoping that Turkey will stay out.  Stop and think for a moment,\nwill you?  Armenia doesn't need anyone to drag her into the conflict, it\nis a part of it.  \n\n\nHuh?  You didn't expect Azeri's to be friendly to forces fighting with them\nwithin their borders?  \n\n[...]\n\nYou're not playing with a full deck, are you?  Where would Turkey invade?\nAre you throwing the Cyprus buzzword around with s.c.g. in the header\nin hopes that the Greek netters will jump the gun?  Yes indeed Turkey\nhas the military prowess to intervene, what she wishes she had, however, is \nthe diplomatic power to stop the hostilities and bring the parties to the\nnegotiating table.  That's hard to do when Armenians are attacking Azeri \ntowns.  Armenian leaders are lacking the statesmanship to recognize the \nfutility of armed conflict and convince their nation that a compromise that \nleads to stability is much better than a military faits accomplis that's \ngoing to cause incessant skirmishes.  Think of 10 or 20 years down the \nline -- both of the newly independent countries need to develop economically\nand neither one is going to wipe the other out.  These people will be\nneighbors, would it not be better to keep the bad blood between them minimal?\n\nIf you belong to the Armenian diaspora, keep in mind that what strikes\nyour fancy on the map is costing the local Armenians dearly in terms of their\nblood and future.  It's easy to be comfortable abroad and propagandize \ncraziness to have your feelings about Turks tickled.  The Armenians\nin Armenia and N-K will be there, with the same people you seem to hate \nas their neighbors, for maybe 3000 years more.  The sooner there's peace in\nthe region the better it is for them and everyone else.  I'd push for\ncompromise if I were you instead of hitting the caps-lock and spreading\ninflammatory half-truths.\n\ncheers,
Does anyone have a schedule of Kol Israel broadcasts in different\nlanguages that could be posted or e-mailed to me. Your\nassistance would be greatly appreciated
[ANAS] A high rank Israeli officer was killed during a clash whith a Hamas\n[ANAS] Mujahid.  The terrorist Israelis chased and killed a young Mujahid\n[ANAS] using anti-tank missiles.  The terrorist zionists cut the Mujahid's\n[ANAS] body into small pieces to the extend that his body was not recognized.\n[ANAS] At leat ten houses were destroyed by these atni-tank missiles.\n\nIf indeed Israeli soldiers killed a "Hamas Mujahid" with an anti-tank missile\nthen I'm almost sure that the "terrorist zionists" would not have been able\nto cut up a body which was probably desintegrated by the missile.\n\nStop polluting the net with you fantasies.\n\nTsiel
This is an interesting question to ponder.  Did Brad/Ali's sickness\nmake Ayatollah-style Islam attractive to him or did this new religion \nthat Brad/Ali has formally adopted give him this sickness?
DA] Armenia is involved in fighting with Azarbaijan.  It is Armenian\nDA] soldiers from mainland Armenia that are shelling towns in Azarbaijan.\n\n\nAre you related to 'Arromdian' of ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism\nTriangle? If you feel that you can simply act as a fascist Armenian \ngovernmental crony in this forum you will be sadly mistaken and duly \nembarrassed. This is not a lecture to another historical revisionist \nand a genocide apologist, but a fact. This time, fascist x-Soviet Armenian \nGovernment will not get away with the genocide of 204,000 Azeri men, women \nand children. Not a chance.\n\n The SUNDAY TIMES 8 March 1992\n Morgues fill as Azeris head for all-out war\n -------------------------------------------\n Thomas Goltz, the first to report the massacre by Armenian soldiers in\n the worst violence since the breakup of the Soviet Union, reports from\n Agdam\n ------\n Khojaly used to be a barren town, with empty shops and treeless dirt\n roads. Yet it was still home to thousands of people who, in happier\n times, tended fields and flocks of geese. Last week it was wiped off\n the map.\n .......\n As sickening reports trickled in to the Azerbaijani border town of\n Agdam, and the bodies piled up in the morgues, there was little doubt\n that Khojaly and the stark foothills and gullies around it had been\n the site of the most terrible massacre since the Soviet Union broke\n apart.\n .......\n I was the last Westerner to visit Khojaly. That was in january and\n people were predicting their fate with grim resignation. Zumrut Ezoya,\n a mother of four on board the helicopter that ferried us into the\n town, called her community "sitting ducks, ready to get shot". She and\n her family were among the victims of the massacre on February 26.\n .......\n "The Armenians have taken all the outlying villages, one by one, and\n the government does nothing." Balakisi Sakikov, 55, a father of five,\n said. "Next they will drive us out or kill us all," said Dilbar, his\n wife. The couple, their three sons and three daughters were killed in\n the assault, as were many other people I had spoken to.\n ......\n "It was close to the Armenian lines we knew we would have to cross.\n There was a road, and the first units of the column ran across then\n all hell broke loose. Bullets were raining down from all sides. we had\n just entered their trap."\n The azeri defenders picked off one by one. Survivors say that Armenian\n forces then began a pitiless slaughter, firing at anything moved in\n the gullies. A video taken by an azeri cameraman, wailing and crying\n as he filmed body after body, showed a grizzly trail of death leading\n towards higher, forested ground where the villagers had sought refuge\n from the Armenians.\n "The Armenians just shot and shot and shot," said Omar Veyselov, lying\n in hospital in Agdam with sharapnel wounds. "I saw my wife and\n daughter fall right by me."\n People wandered through the hospital corridors looking for news of the\n loved ones. Some vented their fury on foreigners: " Where is my\n daughter, where is my son ?" wailed a mother. "Raped. Butchered. Lost."\n Azerbaijan has said as many as 1,000 refugees were killed as they\n tried to flee. The Armenians have denied this, saying the civilians\n were caught in "crossfire".\n .......\n\nSource: The Times, 2 March 1992.\n\nCORPSES LITTER HILLS IN KARABAKH\n\nANATOL LIEVEN COMES UNDER FIRE WHILE FLYING WITH AZERBAIJANI FORCES TO \nINVESTIGATE THE ALLEGED MASS KILLINGS OF REFUGEES BY ARMENIAN TROOPS...\n\nAs we swooped low over the snow-covered hills of Nagorno-Karabagh we saw \nthe scattered corpses. Apparently, the refugees had been shot down as \nthey ran. An Azerbaijani film of the places we flew over, shown to \njournalists afterwards, showed DOZENS OF CORPSES lying in various parts \nof the hills.\n\nThe Azerbaijanis claim that AS MANY AS 1000 have died in a MASS KILLING \nof AZERBAIJANIS fleeing from the town of Khodjaly, seized by Armenians \nlast week. A further 4,000 are believed to be wounded, frozen to death \nor missing... \n\nSeven of us squatted in the cabin of an Azerbaijani M24 attack helicopter \nas we flew to investigate the claims of the mass killings. Suddenly there \nwas a thump against the underside of the aircraft, a red flash of tracer \nripped past the starboard wing, and the helicopter rocked sharply. We \nswung round, and there was a deafening burst of fire from the cannon \nunder our wing as the helicopter crew returned fire.\n\nWe had been fired on from an Armenian anti-aircraft post. We swung round \nagain, tipped to starboard and appeared to dive straight down into a \nvalley. The brown earth swooped around our heads, the helicopter swung \nround again and followed the contours of the ground. Our cannon fired \nrepeated blasts.\n\nLater it emerged that a civilian helicopter that we had been escorting \nhad landed successfully at Nakhichevanik in the east of the disputed \nenclave of Nagorno-Karabakh, to pick up some of the dead. We had, in \nfact, been attacked both by ground fire and by an Armenian helicopter. \nI had seen the Armenian helicopter intermittently through the window, \nits cannons firing, but had thought - mistakenly - that it was on \n"our side". Our group of Western journalists had embarked on a \nsearch-and-rescue flight that had become a combat mission.\n\nOur flight consisted of the civilian passenger helicopter and two \nM24 Soviet attack helicopters in the Azerbaijani service, nicknamed \nflying crocodiles for their armour. Our party was in the second \ncrocodile. The civilian helicopter's job was to land in the mountains \nand pick up bodies at sites of the mass killings. The attack helicopters \nwere there to give covering fire if necessary.\n\nThe operation showed a striking sign of the disintegration of the Soviet \narmed forces because our pilot was a Russian officer. An Azerbaijani \nofficial told us that there were now five former Soviet military \nhelicopters -and their pilots- fighting for Azerbaijan. "They have \nsigned contracts to fly for us," he said. The helicopter we engaged \nin combat was most probably flown by a brother-officer of our Russian \npilot, but fighting for the Armenians.\n\nWe had taken off just before 5pm on Saturday from Agdam airfield, an \nheated for the Armenian-controlled mountains of Karabakh, a sheer \nwhite wall in the distance. The civilian helicopter picked up four \ncorpses, and it was during this and a previous mission that an \nAzerbaijani cameraman filmed the several the several dozen bodies \non the hillsides. We then took off again in a hurry and speed back \ntowards Azerbaijani lines. Azerbaijani gunners on the last hill before \nthe plain - and safety - gazed up at us as we passed.\n\nBack at the airfield in Agdam, we took a look the bodies the \ncivilian helicopter had picked up. Two old men a small girl were \ncovered with blood, their limbs contorted by the cold and rigor \nmortis. They had been shot.\n\nWhat did our Russian pilot think of the tragedy, our close shave, \nand the war in Nagorno-Karabakh? He gave us CHEERFUL GRIN, POLITELY \nDECLINED TO ANSWER QUES TIONS, AND MARCHED OFF TO HIS DINNER.\n\nSerdar Argic
Who is the you Arabs here.  Since you are replying to my article you\nare assuming that I am an Arab.  Well, I'm not an Arab, but I think you\nare brain is full of shit if you really believe what you said.  The\nbombardment of civilian and none civilian areas in Lebanon by Israel is\nvery consistent with its policy of intimidation.  That is the only\npolicy that has been practiced by the so called only democracy in\nthe middle east!
The Orders for the Turkish Extermination of the Armenians #17\n    To the children of genocide: "Send them away into the Desert"\n\nThis is part of a continuing series of articles containing official Turkish \nwartime (WW1) governmental telegrams, in translation, entailing the orders \nfor the extermination of the Armenian people in Turkey. Generally, these\ntelegrams were issued by the Turkish Minister of the Interior, Talaat Pasha,\nfor example, we have the following set regarding children:\n\n	"To the Government of Aleppo.\n\n	 November 5, 1915. We are informed that the little ones belonging to\n	 the Armenians from Sivas, Mamuret-ul-Aziz, Diarbekir and Erzeroum\n	 [hundreds of km distance from Aleppo] are adopted by certain Moslem\n	 families and received as servants when they are left alone through\n	 the death of their parents. We inform you that you are to collect\n	 all such children in your province and send them to the places of\n	 deportation, and also to give the necessary orders regarding this to\n	 the people.\n\n				Minister of the Interior,\n\n						Talaat" [1]\n\n	"To the Government of Aleppo.\n\n	 September 21, 1915. There is no need for an orphanage. It is not the\n	 time to give way to sentiment and feed the orphans, prolonging their\n	 lives. Send them away to the desert and inform us.\n\n				Minister of the Interior,\n						Talaat" [2]\n\n	"To the General Committee for settling and deportees.\n\n	 November 26, 1915. There were more than four hundred children in the\n	 orphanage. They will be added to the caravans and sent to their\n	 places of exile.\n\n	 				Abdullahad Nuri. [3]\n\n\n	"To the Government of Aleppo.\n\n	 January 15, 1916. We hear that certain orphanages which have been\n	 opened receive also the children of the Armenians. Whether this is\n	 done through the ignorance of our real purpose, or through contempt\n	 of it, the Government will regard the feeding of such children or\n	 any attempt to prolong their lives as an act entirely opposed to it\n	 purpose, since it considers the survival of these children as\n	 detrimental. I recommend that such children shall not be received\n	 into the orphanages, and no attempts are to be made to establish\n	 special orphanages for them.\n\n				Minister of the Interior,\n\n						Talaat." [4]\n\n	"To the Government of Aleppo.\n\n\n	 Collect and keep only those orphans who cannot remember the tortures\n	 to which their parents have been subjected. Send the rest away with\n	 the caravans.\n\n				Minister of the Interior,\n\n						Talaat" [5]\n\n	"From the Ministry of the Interior to the Government of Aleppo.\n\n	 At a time when there are thousands of Moslem refugees and the widows\n	 of Shekid [fallen soldiers] are in need of food and protection, it is\n	 not expedient to incur extra expenses by feeding the children left by\n	 Armenians, who will serve no purpose except that of giving trouble\n	 in the future. It is necessary that these children should be turned\n	 out of your vilayet and sent with the caravans to the place of\n	 deportation. Those that have been kept till now are also to be sent\n	 away, in compliance with our previous orders, to Sivas.\n\n				Minister of the Interior,\n\n						Talaat" [6]\n\nIn 1926, Halide Edip (a pioneer Turkish nationalist) wrote in her memoirs\nabout a conversation with Talaat Pasha, verifying and "rationalizing" this\nultra-national fascist anti-Armenian mentality, the following:\n\n	"I have the conviction that as long as a nation does the best for\n	 its own interest, and succeeds, the world admires it and thinks\n	 it moral. I am ready to die for what I have done, and I know I\n	 shall die for it." [7]\n\n\nThese telegrams were entered as unquestioned evidence during the 1923 trial of\nTalaat Pasha's, assassin, Soghomon Tehlerian. The Turkish government never\nquestioned these "death march orders" until 1986, during a time when the world\nwas again reminded of the genocide of the Armenians.\n\nFor reasons known to those who study the psychology of genocide denial, the\nTurkish government and their supporters in crime deny that such orders were\never issued, and further claim that these telegrams were forgeries based on a\nstudy by S. Orel and S. Yuca of the Turkish Historical Society.\n\nIf one were to examine the sample "authentic text" provided in the Turkish \nHistorical Society study and use their same forgery test on that sample, it \ntoo would be a forgery!. In fact, if any of the tests delineated by the \nTurkish Historical Society are performed an any piece of Ottoman Turkish or \nPersian/Arabic script, one finds that anything handwritten in such language is\na forgery. \n\nToday, the body of Talaat Pasha lies in a tomb on Liberty Hill, Istanbul,\nTurkey, just next to the Yildiz University campus. The body of this genocide \narchitect was returned to Turkey from Germany during WW2 when Turkey was in a \nheightened state of proto-fascism. Recently, this monument has served as a\nfocal point for anti-Armenianism in Turkey.\n\nThis monument represents the epitome of the Turkish government's pathological\ndenial of a clear historical event and is an insult to a people whose only\ncrime was to be born Armenian.\n\n			- - - references - - -\n\n[1] _The Memoirs of Naim Bey_, Aram Andonian, 1919, pages 59-60\n\n[2] ibid, page 60\n\n[3] ibid, page 60\n\n[4] ibid, page 61\n\n[5] ibid, page 61\n\n[6] ibid, page 62\n\n[7] _Memoirs of Halide Edip_, Halide Edip, The Century Press, New York (and\n    London), 1926, page 387
Another CPR Non-Fact.\n\n\nActually, they are free to leave and seek work in Egypt, except that\nthe Egyptians don't want them, either.  And who are you going to blame\nif/when Gazans establish their own state of Gaza/Palestine?\n\n\nActually, one such Jew who did risk his life to help Gazan Arabs was\nhacked to death by Palestinean murderers just last week.  It seems\nthat the risk has been primarily from the Arabs "in need of help". \n\nThis is also true for telephone repairmen, traders who seek to buy\nagricultural products from Gazans, Israeli soldiers who get involved\nin fighting between feuding Palestinean groups that are as determined\nto destroy each other as they are to destroy outsiders...\n\n\nI just wanna see you try this here in the USA.

We ran into one of my relatives at the \nbus station and got to talking. A lot of people had gathered not far away,\nnear the store. Well at first we didn't know what was happening, and then a\nfellow I know comes up to me, an Azerbaijani guy, and says, "What are you\nstanding here for? Go home immediately!" I asked, "What's going on?" He says, \n"What's the matter, can't you see, they've overturned a car and they're \nkilling Armenians!" He helped me catch a cab and we got home safely.\n\nWe sat at home for two days. During that time a gang of bandits came into our \ncourtyard. But the neighbors wouldn't let them in the building. There were \nabout 80 of them. They had sticks and pieces of armatures in their hands. They\nwere shouting something, but you couldn't understand it. It wasn't one voice \nor two, all of them were shouting in a chorus. They turned toward Building 35.\nThey went up to the third _floor, and we see that they're breaking glass and \nthrowing things out the window. After a while they come out the entryway: one \nhas a pair of jeans in his hands, another has a tape recorder, and a third a \nguitar. They went on toward the auto parts store.\n\nWe had to save ourselves. After midnight on March 1 we went to hide at School \nNo. 33, which is in Microdistrict 13. There were two other Armenian families \nthere with us. There were 13 of us altogether. Out of all of them I had only \nknown Ernest before, he had moved to Sumgait from Kirovabad. The Azerbaijani \nguard at the school let us in. At first he didn't want to, but there was \nnowhere else for us to go. We had to plead with him and talk him into it. We \nwere told that on that day, the 1st, there would be an attack on our \nmicrodistrict.\n\nWe went upstairs to a classroom on the second floor.\n\nOn the city radio station they announced three telephone numbers that could be\nused to summon assistance or communicate anything important. I called one of \nthem and the First Secretary of the Sumgait City Party Committee answered. I\nasked him for assistance. I say, "We're in School No. 33, we need to be \nevacuated." Well he says, "Got it, wait there, I'm sending out help now."\n\nI know his voice. The First Secretary had been to our plant, I had spoken with\nhim personally. When I called he said, "Muslimzade here."\n\nAbout two hours after the call we heard shouts near the school. We looked out\nthe window and about 100 to 120 people were outside saying, "Armenians, come \nout, we're here to get you." They have clubs, axes, and armature shafts in \ntheir hands. The guard sat there with us, and asked, "Where should I go?" I \nsay, "If your life is of any value to you you'll go down there and say that \nthe Armenians were here and that they left." That's what he did. He went down \nthere and said, "The Armenians were here," he said, "I let them out the back \ndoor, they went that way." And pointed with his hand. And with shouts and \nnoise the mob set off in the direction he had pointed.\n\nSo the assistance we had been promised did come. They sent us help, all right!\nInstead of sending real soldiers he had sent his own. I am positive that\nMuslimzade did that. No one had seen us entering the school, no one knew that \nwe were there. In any case, we stayed at the school until seven in the \nmorning, and no soldiers of any sort came to our aid.\n\nIn the morning we went to my relative's in Microdistrict 1, and the soldiers \ntook us to the SK club from there. The club was jammed with people, and there \nwere lots of people ahead of us--there was no space available. One small boy, \nabout three months old, died right in my arms. There wasn't a single doctor, \nnothing. The boy was uninjured, there were no wounds or bruises on him. He was\njust very ill. They gave him mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, they did everything\nthey could under the circumstances, but were unable to save him. And his \nmother and father, a young Armenian couple, were right there, on the floor ...\n\nI searched for a spot for us in the SK, we have a small child of our own, I\nwanted to find a room or something to put my family in. I went up to the third\nfloor, there were a lot of soldiers up there, bandaged, with canes, limping, \nwith their heads broken open. They were a terrible sight. Young guys, all of \nthem.\n\nThere were a lot of bandaged Armenians, too. Everyone had been beaten, \neveryone was crying, wailing, and calling for help. I think that the City\nParty Committee ignored us completely. True, there was a snack bar: a sausage \nwas 30 kopeks or 40 kopeks, a package of cookies that cost 26 kopeks was being\nsold for 50, a bottled soft drink cost a ruble . . . But there was no way to \nget the things any cheaper.\n\nI met my old uncle, Aram Mikhailovich, there. He saw me and tears welled up in\nhis eyes. My whole life he had told me that we were friendly peoples, that we \nworked together, he always had Azerbaijanis over at his house. And now he saw \nme and there was nothing he could say, he just cried. You can understand his \nfeelings, of course.\n\n   April 8, 1988\n   Yerevan\n\n		     - - - reference - - -\n\n[1] _The Sumgait Tragedy; Pogroms against Armenians in Soviet Azerbaijan,\n    Volume I, Eyewitness Accounts_, edited by Samuel Shahmuradian, forward by\n    Yelena Bonner, 1990, published by Aristide D.

Just to address this one point, what about the two Katyusha rocket \nattacks made within Lebanon, for which Fatah claimed responsibility.\nI didn't realize that one can use Katyushas while onr is disarmed.\nAlso, Page 8 of today's New York Times, Faisal Saleh, a high ranking \nFatah official, and his 9 month old son were gunned down in Beirut \nby members of Abu Nidal.  There have been 46 assasination attempts \nin 1993 alone in the fued between these two factions, resulting in\n11 deaths.
I don't, though when I was in Israel I did make a point of listening\nto JTV news, as well as Monte Carlo Radio.  In the United States,\nI generally read the NYT, and occasionally, a mainstream Israeli\nnewpaper.\n\n\nWhat you may not be taking into account is that the JP is no longer\nrepresentative of the mainstream in Israel.  It was purchased a few\nyears ago and in the battle for control, most of the liberal and\nleft-wing reporters walked out.  The new owner stated in the past,\nmore than once, that the JP's task should be geared towards explaining\nand promoting Israel's position, more than attacking the gov't (Likud\nat the time).  The paper that I would recommend reading, being middle\nstream and factual is "Ha-Aretz" - or at least this was the case two\nyears ago.\n\n\nAnd what about the "Nat'l Enquirer"? 8^)\nBut seriously, if one were to read some of the leftist newspapers\none could arrive at other conclusions.  The information you received\nwas highly selective and extrapolating from it is a bad move.
It would be nice if, as you rightly point out the inherent value of\nfreedom of speech, discussion would also deal with the all-to-\nfrequent ritualized abuses and distortions of that freedom that do \noccur. There are situations where a few extremely vocal, and \nusually radical, people **do** drive people away, effectively stifle\nall other ("opposing") views and generally "take over". *Clearly*,\nthe purpose behind such actions is *to deprive* others of *their*\nfreedom of speech through overt and covert coercion and domination of \nthe "media form" in question. While "freedom" of speech is to be valued,  \nthis is not. How would you suggest that this sort of reoccuring problem be \nalleviated? More particularly, how can this be controlled within the \nstructure of these newsgroups?
Is this the joke of the month? \n\n1. Your fascist grandparents exterminated 2.5 million Muslim people\nbetween 1914 and 1920.\n\n2. Your Nazi parents fully participated in the extermination of the\nEuropean Jewry during WWII.\n\n3. Your criminal cousins have been slaughtering Muslim women, children\nand elderly people in fascist x-Soviet Armenia and Karabag for the last \nfour years.\n\nThe entire population of x-Soviet Armenia now, as a result of the \nGenocide of 2.5 million Muslim people, are Armenians. \n\nFor nearly one thousand years, the Turkish and Kurdish people \nlived on their homeland - the last one hundred under the \noppressive Soviet and Armenian occupation. The persecutions\nculminated in 1914: The Armenian Government planned and carried \nout a Genocide against its Muslim subjects. 2.5 million Turks \nand Kurds were murdered and the remainder driven out of their \nhomeland. After one thousand years, Turkish and Kurdish lands \nwere empty of Turks and Kurds. \n\nThe survivors found a safe heaven in Turkiye.\n\nToday, x-Soviet Armenian government rejects the right of Turks and \nKurds to return to their Muslim lands occupied by x-Soviet Armenia.\n\nToday, x-Soviet Armenian government covers up the genocide perpetrated \nby its predecessors and is therefore an accessory to this crime against \nhumanity.\n\nx-Soviet Armenian government must pay for their crime of genocide \nagainst the Muslims by admitting to the crime and making reparations \nto the Turks and Kurds.\n\nTurks and Kurds demand the right to return to their lands, to determine \ntheir own future as a nation in their own homeland.\n\nDuring the 78th Anniversary, we come once again reiterate the\nunity of the Muslim People, the timelessness of the Turkish\nand Kurdish Demands and the desire to pursue the struggle\nfor that restitution - a struggle that unites all Turks and Kurds.\n\nToday, we appeal to all Turkish and Kurdish people in the United \nStates and Canada to participate en masse in the Commemorative \nEvents, be they cultural, political or religious.\n\n\nSerdar Argic
You can dream whatever you wish. We have demands from the Armenians.\nWith the Government of x-Soviet Armenia, we would sit down, go over\nall our outstanding issues, whether it's land or reparations or\nrecognition, whatever it is. We'd like to sit down and ask for it.\nBy all means, lands and properties were taken away from us and they\nshould be returned to the rightful owners, the Turkish and Kurdish \npeople, who were there 3,000 years, long before the Armenians ever\nshowed up in that area. Entire population of the region was subjected \nto genocide beyond belief; genocide which was planned to exterminate \nthe whole Turkish people of the region to the last man, woman and child. \nArmenians tortured and massacred millions of defenseless civilians. To \nassemble innocent civilians in the mosques and burn them in the buildings \nwas one of their methods. Even today the traveler in that region is seldom \nfree from the evidence of these Armenian crimes.\n\nIf you have the stomach, I would strongly recommend the following\nreferences on the Armenian genocide of the Muslims.

the 'Center for Policy Research' writes...\n \n\n    Considering all the murders of innocent Israelis at the hands \n    of Arab death merchants, I see nothing wrong with the advice.\n\n\n    As usual, the bias of the 'Center for Policy Research' echoes\n    through this newsgroup.  Here we have an enraged Likudnik who\n    is venting his spleen, and you portray it as if this is going\n    to become policy.  You don't say what the response to Matza's\n    suggestion was.  Do do not mention whether he was refering to\n    terrorists caught in the act, which could be a clear cut case\n    of self-defence.  Would you care to elaborate on this, or was\n    this all you wanted to say on the matter.  Why don't you give\n    up this 'Center for Policy Research' crap, and just post your  \n    biases without trying to legitimize them with a pompous name?\n\n\n    A laudable precaution.  \n    \n    Every single thing you post about Israel is posted to portray\n    Israel as negatively as you can.  Deliberate omissions are an\n    integral part of the shtick.  And it's not only the incidents\n    that you do not mention, but even the stories you do post are\n    fraught with omissions, which change the entire meaning.  The\n    absurdity of your respectable name cannot hide your bias.\n\n    In your effort to portray Israel in an unfavorable light, you \n    have accomplished nothing, except to prove that a respectable \n    sounding label like the Center for Policy Research is nothing \n    but a smoke screen for someone with a heavily biased attitude \n    against Israel and the need to vent it.

Now, in the deceptive guise of\n[DG] tolerance, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum begins a propaganda\n[DG] campaign, financed through the unwitting largess of the American taxpayer,\n[DG] in the interests of Israel and its adherents in America.\n\n[JAKE] After reading the first paragraph, a quick scan confirmed my first\n[JAKE] impression: this is a bunch of revisionist and anti-semitic hogwash.\n\nJake, I'm really disappointed in you.

Of course, it hasn't.  Besides Egypt, the rest of the Arab world still\nofficially denies that Israel exists.\n\n\nKick out Syria?\n\n\nAmerican-Occupied Lebanon?  That's a new one on me!
Hehehe.\n\nBTW, does the Litani River not flow West and not South? I think that its waters\nstay entirely within Lebanese territory and so what Hasan says about the Jordan\nRiver makes no sense, in any case. The Hasbani River, on the other hand, flows\ninto the Jordan, if I am not mistaken.

All humans suffered emotionally, some Jews and many\nothers suffered physically. It is sad that people like you are\nso blinded by emotions that they can't see the facts. Thanks\nfor calling me names, it only assures me of what kind of\nignorant people I am dealing with. I included your letter since\nI thought it demonstrated my point more than anything I could\nwrite.
Well, you should have noted that I was cheering an attack on an Israeli \npatrol INSIDE Lebanese territory while I was condemning the "retaliatory"\nshelling of Lebanese villages by Israeli and Israeli-backed forces. My "team",\nyou see, was "playing fair" while the opposing team was rearranging the\nfaces of the spectators in my team's viewing stands, so to speak. \n\nI think that you should try to find more sources of news about what goes on\nin Lebanon and try to see through the propaganda. There are no a priori\nblack and white hats but one sure wonders how the IDF can bombard villages in \nretaliation to pin-point attacks on its soldiers in Lebanon and then call the\nLebanese terrorists.
According to the 1990 Harvard Alumni Directory, Mr. O'Keefe failed to\ngraduate.  You may decide for yourselves if he was indeed educated\nanywhere.
It seems to me that you are the one who is supposed to do some reading. I think\nthat our major difference in opinion is on the legitimacy of Sevres. First, thattreaty was signed by the Ottoman Empire therefore legally it does not bind the \nRepublic of Turkey. The new independence movement (which by the way, is not the same as the Young Turks) naturally rejected it out of hand. to say that we \nshould accept because the Germans did theirs is absurd. We saw what the cosequences of such harsh treaties were in Hitler. Second, the Sevres treaty was even \nworse than Versailles. It divided the Ottoman Empire in to several influence \nzones, had the capital occupied, the economy under Allied control, the army di\nminished to nothing but a police force, in short a country in name only. I'd\nwonder if you would like to live under such conditions. And for the record, I donot feel sorry for the soldiers killed in IZMIR harbour. Before evacuating the \ncity, the Greek forces burned it down, so it serves them right.\nAs for being fooled by Allied promises, that too is your fault. You did not come to Anatolia just to enforce Sevres but to take part in the plunder  as well.\nK. Burak Ucer
DEPOSITION of VITALY NIKOLAYEVICH DANIELIAN [1]\n\n\n          Born 1972\n          Attended 9th Grade\n          Middle School No. 17\n\n          Resident at Building 4/2, Apartment 25\n          Microdistrict No. 3\n          Sumgait [Azerbaijan]\n\nReally, people in town didn't know what was happening on February 27. I came \nhome from school at 12 o'clock, being excused to leave before the last period \nin order to go to Baku. When we left, everything in town was fine. Life was \nthe same as usual, a few groups of people were discussing things, soccer and \nother things. Then we got on the Sumgait bus bound for Baku for my first \ncousin's birthday, my father, my mother, and I. We spent the day in Baku, and \non the 28th, somewhere around 6:00 p.m., we got on the bus for home, figuring \nthat I'd have enough time to do my homework for the next day.\n\nWhen we were entering town, near the 12-story high-rises, our bus was stopped \nby a very large crowd. The crowd demanded that the Armenians get off the bus. \nThe driver says that there are no Armenians on board; then everyone on the bus\nbegins to shout that there are no Armenians on board. The group comes up to \nthe doors of the bus and has people get out one by one, not checking \npassports, just going by the way people look. We get off the bus, but are not \ntaken for Armenians.\n\nWe set out in the direction of home. At first we were going to go into an old \nbuilding where we knew there'd be a place to hide, but the whole road was \npacked with groups of people, all the way from Block 41 to the 8th \nMicrodistrict. These groups were emptying people's pockets and checking\npassports. People who didn't have passports with them were beaten as well.\nThen we decided to go home instead. Near the 12-story high-rises I saw burning\ncars and a great many people standing around the driveways, yelling. "Death to\nthe Armenians" was written on the cars.\n\nWhen we came into the courtyard--we live in an L-shaped building--it was still\nquiet. We went on upstairs, but didn't turn on any lights. We tried to call \nBaku to warn our relatives, who were due to arrive on Wednesday, not to come. \nThen there was a knock at the door. It was our neighbors, who advised us to \ncome down to stay at their place. We went down to their place, and they led us\nto the basement. They live on the first floor and have a basement which you \nenter across the balcony. We sat in the basement while an Armenian woman was \nbeaten--she ran away naked. Our neighbors' daughter said that that's right, \nthat's what the Armenians deserve, because in Stepanakert, allegedly, people \nwere being killed, 11 girls from Agdam had been raped. We didn't stay very \nlong in the basement. We tried to support one another as best we could, \nlooking out the small window with the iron grating. Papa watched and said \nthings now and then. He said that there was a fire near Building 5, probably a\ncar on fire. Then one of the groups approached our driveway and demanded that \nthey be shown the apartments where Armenians lived. The neighbors said that \nthere weren't any Armenians here, and the group set out for the other wing of \nthe building. They appeared from the 5/2 side of the building, where, I later \nfound out, a woman had been murdered. The woman who ran away naked died. Yuri\nAvakian was killed, too.\n\nWhen the crowd left, the neighbors said that it was all over and we could go \nhome. We went back up to our place and again didn't turn on the light. We \nstarted to gather up our things in order to leave Sumgait for a while. We\ntried to call a relative who lived in Sumgait, but there was no answer. We\ndecided she had already left.\n\nWe sat at home. The phone rang, and the caller asked to speak with my\nfather. I called him to the phone. It was Jeykhun Mamedov, from my father's\nwork brigade. He said he was disgusted by what was happening in our\ntown. He asked for our address and promised to get a car and help us get\nout of the city. To be quite honest, Papa didn't want to give him our address,\nbut my mother got on the phone and told him. Some 15 minutes after the\ncall a crowd ran into our entryway. Bursting into the building, they broke\ndown the door and came into the apartment . . .\n\nThey came straight to our apartment, they knew exactly where the Armenians \nwere. They came into our place. We tried to resist, but there was nothing we \ncould do. One of them took my parents' passports and began to read them. He \nread the surname "Danielian," turned the page, read "Armenian," and that alone\nwas enough to doom us. He said that we should be moved quickly out into the \ncourtyard, where they would have done with us. Another, standing next to him, \npushed some of the keys on the piano and said "your death has tolled." They \nhad knives and steel truncheons.\n\nI had a knife in my hand. Unfortunately, I didn't use it. I just knew that if\nI didn't give up the knife things would be much worse. They struck my parents \nand said that I should put the knife on the piano. Then, one of them commanded\nthat we be taken outside. One person was giving orders. When we were taken \noutdoors I went in the middle, and my mother was behind me. Someone started to\npush her so she'd walk faster; I let her go ahead of me, and fell in behind \nher. When he tried to push me, I hit him, and at that moment they began \nbeating my parents; I realized that resistance was completely useless.\n\nWe are taken out into the courtyard, and the neighbors are standing on their \nbalconies to see what will happen next. The crowd surrounds us. At first they \nstrike me, and I'm knocked out; when I come to, they beat me again . . . I \nlose consciousness often . . . I don't see or hear my parents, since I was the\nfirst one hit and was out cold. When I come to I try to pick them up; they are\nlying next to me. The crowd is gone, the only people around are watching from \ntheir balconies. That's it. I try to pick them up, but can't. My left arm is \nbroken. I start toward the drive, wanting to tell the neighbors to call an \nambulance. The bodies of my parents are still warm.\n\nWe were attacked at around 9 o'clock. I regain consciousness at about 11 and \ntry to make it up the stairs home . . . When I knock at the neighbors' door, \nthey push me back and tell me to go away. I go up to the third floor, our \nneighbor puts a damp cloth on my head and says she will call an ambulance; she\nsends her son off for one and takes me to our apartment. I often look out the \nwindow to see if the ambulance has arrived, but I can't see very far as a \nresult of the blows, and it seems that my parents have already been taken \naway. Then I calm down and try to convince myself that they have been taken \naway, and everything will be OK.\n\nBut they were still there. Later, at 8 in the morning as I found out, the\nambulance picked them up, but they were already dead. If they received\nattention on time, it is possible they would still be alive. Later, around 12 \no'clock on the 29th, policemen in civilian clothing come to our house with \nsome "assistants." They call an ambulance, and 20 minutes later it arrives, \nand I am taken to the Sumgait Emergency Hospital. There they stitch the wounds\non my head and rebind my arm. At 3 o'clock I and the other Armenians who are \nin the hospital are sent by ambulance to Baku.\n\nIn my ward at the Sumgait Hospital there were five people, all of them\nArmenians. The hospital was nearly overflowing with Armenians. The only\nAzerbaijanis there were those whose car had flipped over before the events,\nbefore the 27th.\n\nThen I was in the Semashko Hospital in Baku. I was there 38 days. When I was \nreleased, on the 40th day, I found out that my parents were dead. At first \nthey told me that they were in Moscow being treated, but later I found out \nthat they were dead. My father's older brother told me.\n\nMy father's name was Nikolai Artemovich Danielian. He was born in 1938. My \nmother, born in 1937, was Seda Osipovna Danielian. Papa worked at PMK-20, the \nleader of the roofing brigade; mamma was a compressor operator.\n\nThey were also beaten on the head. The coroner's report stated that their\nheads were smashed open and bled profusely.\n\nAt the confrontation I met Jeykhun Mamedov, who had called. As it turned out \nlater, he had been the one who tipped the crowd off. He had called \nspecifically to find out if we were at home and to find out the exact address \nand dispatch the group. He knew the phone number, but didn't know the address.\nBefore the events I had never seen him, but had often spoken with him on the \nphone, when he would ask to speak with my father. I knew him by name. He \ndenies that I was the one who answered the phone, saying that my father \nanswered it. He denies that he called from a public phone, saying that he \ncalled from home, which also isn't true. I heard noise and the sounds of \nautomobiles. As I later found out, earlier he had been convicted, but had \nnever served any time--he had received a suspended sentence. He was about 20 \nyears old. I don't know if he has since confessed or not. I am sure that he \nwas the one who tipped the crowd off. One-hundred percent sure.\n\nMy parents were from Karabagh. Father was from the village of Badar, and was \ntwo years old when his family moved to Baku, where his elder brothers were to\ngo to school. He was a student at the Naval School, but never graduated. He\nwent off to work on the virgin lands [one of the gigantic agricultural \nprojects instituted under Khrushchev.] When he returned he lived in Baku, and \nlater moved to Sumgait, helping with the town's construction. Mamma was from \nthe village of Dagdagan, also from Karabagh. She worked in Sumgait, first in \na bookstore, and later, on a construction site.\n\n\nMy sister is older than I. She lives with her husband here in Karabagh. I\nalways loved my parents. That was why I went on to 9th grade, because it\nwas their dream that I would continue my studies. I finished 8th grade and\nwanted to enter the Baku Nautical School, and after that, the Military\nSchool. But later I changed my mind, or rather, my parents got me to recon-\nsider, saying that it would be better to finish the 10th grade and then join \nthe Naval School. I was planning to be in the Navy almost my whole life\nlong--since childhood I had dreamed of being a sailor. My father wanted it\nmore than anything. He always recollected his youth, telling of the School,\nand he always said that he had made a big mistake in leaving it.\n\nNow I live in Karabagh and never plan to leave here. I will stay at the home \nof my grandfather, of my ancestors, till the end of my days.\n\nWhile in the hospital in Baku I learned the fates of many others who had\nsuffered as well, like Ishkhan [Trdatov]. He managed to hold them off [at\ntheir residence in Microdistrict 3, Building 6/2, Apartment 6.] for a long\ntime, lost his father [Gabriel], and by some miracle managed to survive. I\nalso learned of Uncle Sasha, from Building 5/2, whose daughter was raped\n\n. . . Besides them, Valery--I forgot his last name--was in the hospital too,\nabout a year younger than I, he went to School No. 14. He was riding with\nhis parents in the car. People were throwing rocks at them, he was hit, and\nhis parents brought him to the hospital, and he was in our ward. We even\ncame to be friends. Before that we had just seen each other around town. But\nin the hospital we got to know one another better. I learned of the fates of\nothers, those who had died, or who were befallen by misfortune . . .\n\nToday Suren Harutunian, the First Secretary of the Communist party of Armenia,\nwas shown on television. To be honest I am glad that Armenia agreed to \nrecognize Nagorno Karabagh as part of the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic.\nI was repelled, no, revolted, to hear the Baku announcer who read the decision\nof the Azerbaijani Supreme Soviet Presidium against Karabagh becoming part of \nArmenia.\n\nAfter the events in Sumgait and those in Baku, the best solution is to give\nKarabagh to Armenia, return it to Armenia, since the people want to live\npeacefully with the Azerbaijanis, but everything has to be right before they\ncan do that.\n\nI arrived in Karabagh on April 11. I felt very bad. I had constant headaches.\nAfter a while my strength returned. My older sister, Suzanna, took me in. I \nthink that justice should prevail; the people are demanding their due.\n\nYou can't take away what is their due. My parents and I often spoke of Nagorno\nKarabagh, often visited here--spent almost all of my vacations here. We had \neven decided that if Karabagh would be made part of Armenia, we would move \nhere for sure. We always said that the Armenian people had suffered much, and \nthat what had been done in 1921--removing Nagorno Karabagh from Armenia--was\nwrong. Sooner or later, mistakes should be corrected. And in order to correct \na mistake, it must not be repeated; and the fate of all Nagorno Karabagh lies \nin the hands of our government.\n\nJune 13,1988\n\nStepanakert
Is this group for real? I honestly can't believe that most of you expect you\nor your concerns to be taken remotely seriously if you behave this way in a\nforum for discussion. Doesn't it ever occur to those of you who write letters\nlike the majority of those in this group that you're being mind-bogglingly\nhypocritical?
Well, it did not take long to see how consequent some Greeks are in\nrequesting that Thessaloniki are not called Solun by Bulgarian netters. \nSo, Napoleon, why do you write about Konstantinople and not Istanbul?
Arab leaders are now following by Islamic rules?  (Or is it only applicable\nin cases like this?)  :-\n\nI remember an article of about a year ago which stated that besides his wife,\nSaddam also has a mistress.  Assad's brother has a wife and *several*\nmistresses, and those 'emirs' in the Gulf have, within their lifetimes,\nwives in the double digitas (only they manage to keep four at a time).\n \nThis is all irrelevant.  It takes a *lot* more than infidelity to make these\nleaders ruthless and corrupt.  Maybe Netanyahu thought he could 'cleanse'\nhimself by making such a public confession.  Does the average secular Israeli\ncare, though?  The Mossad probably applauded him.  :-)
Is that what turns you on? The truth needs to be told over and over \nagain. There are Armenians who of course witnessed the Armenian genocide \nof 2.5 million Muslim people between 1914-1920 but their voices of truth \nare suppressed today in the hollow din of anti-Turkish/Muslim campaign\nby the ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle of the fascist \nx-Soviet Armenian Government.

The war\nagainst Azerbaijan under the pretence of protecting the human rights of \nthe Armenians of Ukhari (Upper) Garabag, has meant the destruction of\nAzeri villages and towns, occupation of 10 percent of the territory, 60\nthousand new refugees in addition to 500 thousand already in place.\nThis is all the price of fighting for liberty from Russian imperial rule,\nis said in the document. \n   Azerbaijan's government appeals to all compatriots to make every\neffort to inform the people of the world about the truth in Azerbaijan,\nand to assistance in solving the problems facing the young state.\n   It is stressed in the appeal that there is urgent need for medicine,\nfood, experienced doctors and financial help to settle refugees from\nKelbajar, Fizuli and Lachin regions, and to render medical aid for the \nsick and the wounded men.--O--\n\n\n60 REFUGEES FROM KELBAJAR PERISHED IN THEIR ESCAPE LORRIES \n\n     BAKU (APRIL 5) TURAN: Today, during the evacuation from Kelbajar\nregion, 60 refugees on board two lorries were killed in the fire from the\nArmenian Tanks on the only road to leave Kelbajar.

How would you deal with Arabs who ALWAYS threaten to drive you into the sea or\nburn half your conuntry?  Would you talk nicely?  Would you say please?  You\nwouldn't.  The language of the middle east is power and force.  Sorry - that\nis the way it is now.  If you aren't strong, you go down.  Israel has to talk \nand act tough.  Notice, Israel talks and acts tough in battle, but is willing\nto talk peace.\n\n\n\nTrue - and they have brainwashed their people into thinking Jews are some sort\nof monsters.  Arab non-recognition of Israel and support of war and terror\nis also an important factor, wouldn't you say?\n\n\nWhat do you want Israel to do?  They are negotating? I'm sick of people calling\nfor Israel to withdraw from the territories now.  That's not realistic, don't\nyou realize that?  A solution must be negotiated.  It is on the table.  Have\npatience.
Those who forward offensive posts to the sysadmin aren't curtailing\nanyones' freedom of speech.  The neo-nazi movement has a right to\nmake speeches, say anything they want.  They do not have a right\nto have these speeches published by the N.Y. Times.  That depends\non the Times analysis of the economic and to somewhat extent\nnewsworthy value of those speeches.  Likewise to the sysadmin\nof this fellows system.  If he feels his resources are being\nused in a manner that is not in his best interests, or are\nperhaps embarassing to his organization, he will act just as\nthe New York Times does, not to be a conduit for these ideas.\nThe poster is after all free-loading off of someone else's\npocket book when he posts.  He who controls the purse strings\nhas the right to make the decision how he wants those funds\nspent or not spent.\n\nNoone is going to put the poster in jail, unless he bombs a local\nbuilding as a symbol of his hatred.  Freedom of Speech in no\nway equates to accessibility to conduits of information.  The\nmarket of ideas has its own "natural selection" process that\nweeds out the ga-ga from the credible ideas that are of\nimportance.\n\n\n		Seth Rosenthal
You are conveniently ommitting the fact that the Arab governments told the\nArab citizens of Israel to leave Israel, join with the Arab armies so that\nafter what they felt like an assured victory occured, these Arabs could\nreturn to their former homes, reclaim them as well as anything else they\nwanted that belonged to Jews.  When the Arabs lost, Israel was left with\na bunch of people who has just tried to kill them who now wanted back\ninto the country as citizens.  What would you have done?  Let them in so\nthey could kill Jews?  Israel sees those Arabs who stayed as citizens \nbecause they were loyal to Israel during the war and didn't leave.  Of\ncourse some Arabs could have left to avoid the fighting but distinguishing\nbetween the two is impossible.  Therefore a decision was made based on\nsecuturity of the country.\n\n\nNo kibbutz that I have ever visited has any "employees" unless they had to\nhire some people for the restaurants, hotels etc if there weren't enough \npeople ON the kibbutz to do them.  In such cases, they are paid properly.\nIf a kibbutz turns away an Arab, 9I have never seen or heard of this) but it\nreflects only on the membership comittee of that kibbutz, not the whole\nkibbutz movement.\n\n\nThis just shows how ignorant you are of Israeli politics.  Although the \nmajor parties in Israel aren't religious (however not totally secular),\ndue to the format of the government (coalition) the religious parties have\nalways had a lot of pull since they were needed to form a majority coalition.\nIn fact, from what I heard the present government is the least influenced\nby the religious parties in the existance of Israel.  Israel CANNOT be\ncalled a secular state.  For instace, Haifa is the only city in the country\n(except for maybe some Arab cities) where buses run on the Jewish Sabbath.  \nThere are many other examples of religion in Israel.  Marriages in Israel\nare NOT contolled by the state, but by Rabbis and Priests.  Obviously your \ndisbelief of this fact sheds some light of your ignorance of the country\nyou claim to know so much about.\n\n  Steve\n--

They left and I had an attack. I realized that the dan-\nger was past, and stopped controlling myself. I relaxed for a moment and the \nphysical pain immediately made itself felt. My heart and kidneys hurt. I had \nan awful kidney attack. I rolled back and forth on top of those Christmas\nornaments, howling and howling. I didn't know where I was or how long this \nwent on. When we figured out the time, later it turned out that I howled and \nwas in pain for around an hour. Then all my strength was gone and I burst into\ntears, I started feeling sorry for myself, and so on and so forth . . .\n\nThen someone came into the room. I think I hear someone calling my name. I \nwant to respond and restrain myself, I think that I'm hallucinating. I am \nsilent, and then it continues: it seems that first a man's voice is calling\nme, then a woman's. Later I found out that Mamma had sent our neighbor, the\none whose apartment she was hiding in, Uncle Sabir Kasumov, to our place, \ntelling him, "I know that they've killed Lyuda. Go there and at least bring \nher corpse to me so they don't violate her corpse." He went and returned empty\nhanded, but Mamma thought he just didn't want to carry the corpse into his \napartment. She sent him another time, and then sent his wife, and they were \nwalking through the rooms looking for me, but I didn't answer their calls. \nThere was no light, they had smashed the chandeliers and lamps.\n\nThey started the pogrom in our apartment around five o'clock, and at 9:30 I \nwent down to the Kasumovs'. I went down the stairs myself. I walked out of the\napartment: how long can you wait for your own death, how long can you be \ncowardly, afraid? Come what will. I walked out and started knocking on the \ndoors one after the next. No one, not on the fifth floor, not on the fourth, \nopened the door. On the third floor, on the landing of the stairway, Uncle \nSabir's son started to shout, "Aunt Roza, don't cry, Lyuda's alive!" He \nknocked on his own door and out came Aunt Tanya, Igor, and after them, Mamma. \nAunt Tanya, Uncle Sabir's wife, is an Urdmurt. All of us were in their \napartment. I didn't see Karina, but she was in their home, too, Lying\ndelirious, she had a fever. Marina was there too, and my father and mother.\nAll of my family had gathered there.\n   \nAt the door I lost consciousness. Igor and Aunt Tanya carried me into the\napartment.\n\nLater I found out what they had done to our Karina. Mamma said, "Lyuda, \nKarina's in really serious condition, she's probably dying. If she recognizes \nyou, don't cry, don't tell her that her face looks so awful." It was as though\nher whole face was paralyzed, you know, everything was pushed over to one \nside, her eye was all swollen, and everything flowed together, her lips, her \ncheeks . . . It was as though they had dragged her right side around the whole\nmicrodistrict, that's how disfigured her face was. I said, "Fine." Mamma was \nafraid to go into the room, because she went in and hugged Karina and started \nto cry. I went in. As soon as I saw her my legs gave way. I fell down near the\nbed, hugged her legs and started kissing them and crying. She opened the eye \nthat was intact, looked at me, and said, "Who is it?" But I could barely talk, \nmy whole face was so badly beaten. I didn't say, but rather muttered something\ntender, something incomprehensible, but tender, "My Karochka, my Karina, my \nlittle golden one . . . " She understood me.\n\nThen Igor brought me some water, I drank it down and moistened Karina's lips. \nShe started to groan. She was saying something to me, but I couldn't \nunderstand it. Then I made out, "It hurts, I hurt all over." Her hair was \nglued down with blood. I stroked her forehead, her head, she had grit on her \nforehead, and on her lips . . . She was groaning again, and I don't know how \nto help her. She calls me over with her hand, come closer. I go to her. She's\nsaying something to me, but I can't understand her. Igor brings her a pencil \nand paper and says, "Write it down." She shakes her head as if to say, no, I \ncan't write. I can't understand what she's saying. She wanted to tell me \nsomething, but she couldn't. I say, "Karina, just lie there a little while,\nthen maybe you'll feel better and you can tell me then." And then she says,\n"Maybe it'll be too late." And I completely . . . just broke down, I couldn't\ncontrol myself.\n\nThen I moistened my hand in the water and wiped her forehead and eye. I dipped\na handkerchief into the water and squeezed a little water onto her lips. She \nsays, "Lyuda, we're not saved yet, we have to go somewhere else. Out of this \ndamned house. They want to kill us, I know. They'll find us here, too. We need\nto call Urshan." She repeated this to me for almost a whole hour, Until I \nunderstood her every word. I ask, "What's his number?" Urshan Feyruzovich, \nthat's the head of the administration where she works. "We have to call him." \nBut I didn't know his home number. I say, "Karina, what's his number?" She \nsays, "I can't remember." I say, "Who knows his number? Who can I call?" She \nsays, "I don't know anything, leave me alone."\n\nI went out of the room. Igor stayed to watch over her and sat there, he was \ncrying, too. I say, "Mamma, Karina says that we have to call Urshan. How can \nwe call him? Who knows his telephone number?" I tell Marina, "Think, think, \nwho can we call to find out?" She started calling; several people didn't \nanswer. She called a girlfriend, her girlfriend called another girlfriend and \nfound out the number and called us back. The boss's wife answered and said he \nwas at the dacha. My voice keeps cracking, I can't talk normally. She says, \n"Lyuda, don't panic, get a hold of yourself, go out to those hooligans and \ntell them that they just can't do that." She still didn't know what was really\ngoing on. I said, "It's easy for you to say that, you don't understand what's \nhappening. They are killing people here. I don't think there is a single \nArmenian left in the building, they've cut them all up. I'm even surprised \nthat we managed to save ourselves. "She says, "Well, OK, if it's that serious \n. . . " And all the same she's thinking that my emotions are all churned up \nand that I'm fearing for my life, that in fact it's not all that bad. "OK, \nfine, fine," she says, "if you're afraid, OK, as soon as Urshan comes back \nI'll send him over."\n\nWe called again because they had just started robbing the apartment directly \nunder Aunt Tanya's, on the second floor, Asya Dallakian's apartment. She \nwasn't home, she was staying with her daughter in Karabagh. They destroyed \neverything there . . . We realized that they still might come back. We kept on\ntrying to get through to Aunt Tanya--Urshan's wife is named Tanya too and \nfinally we get through. She says, "Yes, he's come home, he's leaving for your \nplace now." He came. Of course he didn't know what was happening, either, \nbecause he brought two of his daughters with him. He came over in his jeep \nwith his two daughters, like he was going on an outing. He came and saw what \nshape we were in and what was going on in town and got frightened. He has \ngrown up daughters, they're almost my age.\n\nThe three of us carried out Karina, tossed a coat on her and a warm scarf, and\nwent down to his car. He took Karina and me to the Maternity Home. . . No, \nfirst they took us to the po]ice precinct. They had stretchers ready. As\nsoon as we got out of the car they put Karina and me on stretchers and said\nthat we were in serious condition and that we mustn't move, we might have\nfractures. From the stretcher I saw about 30 soldiers sitting and lying on the\nfirst floor, bandaged, on the concrete floor, groaning . . . This was around\neleven o'clock at night. We had left the house somewhere around 1:30. When I \nsaw those soldiers I realized that a war was going on: soldiers, enemies\n. . . everything just like a war.\n\nThey carried me into some office on the stretcher. The emergency medical\npeople from Baku were there. The medical attendant there was an older \nArmenian. Urshan told him what they had done to Karina because she's so proud \nshe would never have told. And this aging Armenian . . . his name was Uncle \nArkady, I think, because someone said "Arkady, get an injection ready," he \nstarted to fill a syringe, and turned around so as to give Karina a shot. But \nwhen he looked at her face he became ill. And he was an old man, in his \nsixties, his hair was all grey, and his moustache, too. He hugged Karina and \nstarted to cry: "What have they done to you?!" He was speaking Armenian. "What\nhave they done to you?!" Karina didn't say anything. Mamma came in then, and \nshe started to cry, too. The man tried to calm her. "I'll give you a shot." \nMamma tells him, "I don't need any shot. Where is the government? Just what \nare they doing? Look what they've done to my children! They're killing people,\nand you're just sitting here!" Some teacups were standing on the table in \nthere. "You're sitting here drinking tea! Look what they've done to my \ndaughters! Look what they've turned them into!" They gave her something to \ndrink, some heart medicine, I think. They gave Karina an injection and the\ndoctor said that she had to be taken to the Maternity Home immediately. Papa \nand Urshan, I think, even though Papa was in bad shape, helped carry Karina \nout. When they put her on the stretcher, none of the medics got near her. I \ndon't know, maybe there weren't any orderlies. Then they came to me: "What's \nthe matter with you?" Their tone was so official that I wrapped myself tighter\nin the half-length coat. I had a blanket on, too, an orange one, Aunt Tanya's.\nI said, "I'm fine." Uncle Arkady came over and was soothing me, and then told \nthe doctor, "You leave, let a woman examine her." A woman came, an \nAzerbaijani, I believe, and said, "What's wrong with you?" I was wearing my \nsister Lyuda's nightshirt, the sister who at this time was in Yerevan. When \nshe was nursing her infant she had cut out a big hole in it so that it would \nbe easier to breast feed the baby. I tore the night shirt some more and showed\nher. I took it off my shoulders and turned my back to her. There was a huge \nwound, about the size of a hand, on my back, from the Indian vase. She said \nsomething to them and they gave me two shots. She said that it should be \ndressed with something, but that they'd do that in the hospital.\n\nThey put me on a stretcher, too. They started looking for people to carry me. \nI raised up my head a little and wanted to sit up, and this woman, I don't \nknow if she was a doctor or a nurse, said, "Lie still, you mustn't move." When\nI was lying back down I saw two policemen leading a man. His profile seemed \nvery familiar to me. I shouted, "Stop!" One of the policemen turned and says, \n"What do you want?" I say, "Bring him to me, I want to look at him." They \nbrought him over and I said, "That person was just in our apartment and he \njust raped me and my sister. I recognize him, note it down." They said, \n"Fine," but didn't write it down and led him on. I don't know where they were \ntaking him.\n\nThen they put my stretcher near where the injured and beaten soldiers were \nsitting. They went to look for the ambulance driver so he would bring the car \nup closer. One of the soldiers started talking to me, "Sister . . . " I don't \nremember the conversation exactly, but he asked me were we lived and what they\ndid to us. I asked him, "Where are you from?" He said that he was from Ufa. \nApparently they were the first that were brought in. The Ufa police. Later I \nlearned that they suffered most of all. He says, "OK, you're Armenians, they \ndidn't get along with you, but I'm a Russian," he says, "what are they trying \nto kill me for?" Oh, I remembered something else. When I went out onto the \nbalcony with Kuliyev for a hammer and nails I looked out the window and saw \ntwo Azerbaijanis beating a soldier near the kindergarten. He was pressed \nagainst the fence and he covered his head with his arms, they were beating him\nwith his own club. The way he cried "Mamma" made my skin crawl. I don't know \nwhat they did to him, if he's still alive or not. And something else. Before \nhe attack on our house we saw sheets, clothes, and some dishes flying from the\nthird or fourth floor of the neighboring building, but I didn't think it was \nAzerbaijanis attacking Armenians. I thought that something was on fire or they\nwere throwing something they didn't need out, or someone was fighting with \nsomeone. It was only later, when they were burning a passenger car in the \nyard, when the neighbors said that they were doing that to the Armenians, that\nI realized that this was serious, that it was anti-Armenian.\n\nThey took Karina and me to the Sumgait Maternity Home. Mamma went to them too \nand said, "I've been beaten too, help me." But they just ignored her. My \nfather went to them and said in a guilty voice, as though it was his fault \nthat he'd been beaten, and says, "My ribs hurt so much, those creeps have \nprobably broken my ribs. Please look at them." The doctor says, "That's not my\njob." Urshan said, "Fine, I'll take you to my place and if we need a doctor, \nI'll find you one. I'll bring one and have him look at you. And he drove them \nto his apartment.\n\nMarina and I stayed there. They examined us. I was more struck by what the \ndoctor said than by what those Azerbaijanis in our apartment did to us. I \nwasn't surprised when they beat us they wanted to beat us, but I was very\nsurprised that in a Soviet medical facility a woman who had taken the\nHippocratic Oath could talk to victims like that. By happy--or unhappy--\ncoincidence we were seen by the doctor that had delivered our Karina. And she,\nhaving examined Karina, said, "No problem, you got off pretty good. Not like \nthey did in Kafan, when you Armenians were killing and raping our women.\n"Karina was in such terrible condition that she couldn't say anything--she\nwould certainly have had something to say! Then they examined me. The same \nstory. They put us in a separate ward. No shots, no medicinal powders, no \ndrugs. Absolutely none! They didn't even give us tea. All the women there soon\nfound out that in ward such and such were Armenians who had been raped. And\nthey started coming and peering through the keyhole, the way people look at \nzoo animals. Karina didn't see this, she was lying there, and I kept her from \nseeing it.\n\nThey put Ira B. in our ward. She had also been raped. True, she didn't have \nany serious bodily injuries, but when she told me what had happened at their \nplace, I felt worse for them than I did for us. Because when they raped Ira \nher daughter was in the room, she was under the bed on which it happened. And\nIra was holding her daughter's hand, the one who was hiding under the bed.\nWhen they were beating Ira or taking her earrings off, gold, when she \ninvoluntarily let go of her daughter's hand, her daughter took her hand again.\nHer daughter is in the fourth grade, she's 11 years old. I felt really awful \nwhen I heard that. Ira asked them not to harm her daughter, she said, "Do what\nyou want with me, just leave my daughter alone." Well, they did what they \nwanted. They threatened to kill her daughter if she got in their way. Now I \nwould be surprised if the criminals had behaved any other way that night. It \nwas simply Bartholomew's Night, I say, they did what they would love to do \nevery day: steal, kill, rape . . .\n\nMany are surprised that those animals didn't harm the children. The beasts \nexplained it like this: this would be repeated in 15 to 20 years, and those \nchildren would be grown, and then, as they put it, "we'll come take the \npleasure out of their lives, those children." This was about the girls that\nwould be young women in 15 years. They were thinking about their tomorrow \nbecause they were sure that there would be no trial and no investigation, just\nas there was no trial or investigation in 1915, and that those girls could be \nof some use in 15 years. This I heard from the investigators; one of the \nvictims testified to it. That's how they described their own natures, that\nthey would still be bloodthirsty in 15 to 20 years, and in 100 years--they\nthemselves said that.\n\nAnd this, too. Everyone is surprised that they didn't harm our Marina. Many \npeople say that they either were drunk or had smoked too much. I don't know \nwhy their eyes were red. Maybe because they hadn't slept the night before, \nmaybe for some other reason, I don't know. But they hadn't been smoking and \nthey weren't drunk, I'm positive, because someone who has smoked will stop at \nnothing he has the urge to do. And they spoke in a cultured fashion with \nMarina: "Little sister, don't be afraid, we won't harm you, don't look over \nthere [where I was], you might be frightened. You're a Muslim, a Muslim woman \nshouldn't see such things." So they were really quite sober . . .\n\nSo we came out of that story alive. Each every day we have lived since it all \nhappened bears the mark of that day. It wasn't even a day, of those several \nhours. Father still can't look us in the eyes. He still feels guilty for what\nhappened to Karina, Mother, and me. Because of his nerves he's started talk-\ning to himself, I've heard him argue with himself several times when he\nthought no one is listening: "Listen," he'll say, "what could I do? What could\nI do alone, how could I protect them?" I don't know where to find the words,\nit's not that I'm happy, but I am glad that he didn't see it all happen. \nThat's the only thing they spared us . . . or maybe it happened by chance. Of \ncourse he knows it all, but there's no way you could imagine every last detail\nof what happened. And there were so many conversations: Karina and I spoke\ntogether in private, and we talked with Mamma, too. But Father was never\npresent at those conversations. We spare him that, if you can say that. And\nwhen the investigator comes to the house, we don't speak with Father present.\n\nOn February 29, the next clay, Karina and I were discharged from the hospital.\nFirst they released me, but since martial law had been declared in the city, \nthe soldiers took me to the police precinct in an armored personnel carrier. \nThere were many people there, Armenian victims. I met the Tovmasian family \nthere. From them I learned that Rafik and their Uncle Grant had died. They \nwere sure that both had died. They were talking to me and Raya, Rafik's wife \nand Grant's daughter, and her mother, were both crying.\n\nThen they took us all out of the office on the first floor into the yard.\nThere's a little one-room house outside there, a recreation and reading area.\nThey took us in there. The women were afraid to go because they thought\nthat they were shooing us out of the police precinct because it had become\nso dangerous that even the people working at the precinct wanted to hide.\nThe women were shouting. They explained to them: "We want to hide you\nbetter because it's possible there will be an attack on the police precinct."\n\nWe went into the little house. There were no chairs or tables in there. We\nhad children with us and they were hungry; we even had infants who needed to \nhave their diapers changed. No one had anything with them. It was just awful. \nThey kept us there for 24 hours. From the window of the one room house you \ncould see that there were Azerbaijanis standing on the fences around the \npolice precinct, as though they were spying on us. The police precinct is \nsurrounded by a wall, like a fence, and it's electrified, but if they were \nstanding on the wall, it means the electricity was shut off. This brought \ngreat psychological pressure to bear on us, particularly on those who hadn't \njust walked out of their apartments, but who hadn't slept for 24 hours, or 48,\nor those who had suffered physically and spiritually, the ones who had lost \nfamily members. For us it was another ordeal. We were especially frightened \nwhen all the precinct employees suddenly disappeared. We couldn't see a single\nperson, not in the courtyard and not in the windows. We thought that they must\nhave already been hiding under the building, that they must have some secret \nroom down there. People were panicking: they started throwing themselves at\none another . . . That's the way it is on a sinking ship. We heard those \npeople, mainly young people, whistling and whopping on the walls. We felt that\nthe end was approaching. I was completely terrified: I had left Karina in the \nhospital and didn't know where my parents were. I was sort of calm about my \nparents, I was thinking only about Karina, if, Heaven forbid, they should \nattack the hospital, they would immediately tell them that there was an \nArmenian in there, and something terrible would happen to Karina again, and \nshe wouldn't be able to take it.\n\nThen soldiers with dogs appeared. When they saw the dogs some of the people \nclimbed down off the fence. Then they brought in about another 30 soldiers.\nThey all had machine guns in readiness, their fingers on the triggers. We \ncalmed down a little. They brought us chairs and brought the children some \nlittle cots and showed us where we could wash our hands, and took the children\nto the toilet. But we all sat there hungry, but to be honest, it would never \nhave occurred to any of us that we hadn't eaten for two days and that people \ndo eat.\n\nThen, closer to nightfall, they brought a group of detained criminals. They \nwere being watched by soldiers with guard dogs. One of the men came back from \nthe courtyard and told us about it. Raya Tovmasian . . . it was like a \ndifferent woman had been substituted. Earlier she had been crying, wailing, \nand calling out: "Oh, Rafik!," but when she heard about this such a rage came \nover her! She jumped up, she had a coat on, and she started to roll up her \nsleeves like she was getting ready to beat someone. And suddenly there were \nsoldiers, and dogs, and lots of people. She ran over to them. The bandits were\nstanding there with their hands above their heads facing the wall. She went up\nto one of them and grabbed him by the collar and started to shake and thrash \nhim! Then, on to a second, and a third. Everyone was rooted to the spot. Not \none of the soldiers moved, no one went up to help or made her stop her from \ndoing it. And the bandits fell down and covered their heads with their hands, \nmuttering something. She came back and sat down, and something akin to a smile\nappeared on her face. She became so quiet: no tears, no cries. Then that round\nwas over and she went back to beat them again. She was walking and cursing \nterribly: take that, and that, they killed my husband, the bastards, the \ncreeps, and so on. Then she came back again and sat down. She probably did \nthis the whole night through, well, it wasn't really night, no one slept. She \nwent five or six times and beat them and returned. And she told the women, \n"What are you sitting there for? They killed your husbands and children, they \nraped, and you're just sitting there. You're sitting and talking as though \nnothing had happened. Aren't you Armenians?" She appealed to everyone, but no \none got up. I was just numb, I didn't have the strength to beat anyone, I \ncould barely hold myself up, all the more so since I had been standing for so \nmany hours--I was released at eleven o'clock in the morning and it was already\nafter ten at night because there weren't enough chairs, really it was the \nelderly and women with children who sat. I was on my feet the whole time. \nThere was nothing to breathe, the door was closed, and the men were smoking. \nThe situation was deplorable.\n\nAt eleven o'clock at night policemen came for us, local policemen, \nAzerbaijanis. They said, "Get up. They've brought mattresses, you can wash up\nand put the children to bed." Now the women didn't want to leave this place, \neither. The place had become like home, it was safe, there were soldiers with \ndogs. If anyone went outside, the soldiers would say, "Oh, it's our little \nfamily," and things like that. The soldiers felt this love, and probably, for \nthe first time in their lives perceived themselves as defenders. Everyone\nspoke from the heart, cried, and hugged them and they, with their loaded\nmachine guns in their hands, said, "Grandmother, you mustn't approach me,\nI'm on guard." Our people would say, "Oh, that's all right." They hugged\nthem, one woman even kissed one of the machine guns. This was all terribly\nmoving for me. And the small children kept wanting to pet the dogs.\n\nThey took us up to the second floor and said, "You can undress and sleep in \nhere. Don't be afraid, the precinct is on guard, and it's quiet in the city."\nThis was the 29th, when the killing was going on in block 41A and in other\nplaces. Then we were told that all the Armenians were being gathered at the\nSK club and at the City Party Committee. They took us there. On the way I \nasked them to stop at the Maternity Home: I wanted to take Karina with me.\nI didn't know what was happening there. They told me, "Don't worry, the\nMaternity Home is full of soldiers, more than mothers-to-be. So you can rest\nassured. I say, "Well, I won't rest assured regardless, because the staff in\nthere is capable of anything."\n\nWhen I arrived at the City Party Committee it turned out that Karina had\nalready been brought there. They had seen fit to release her from the hospi-\ntal, deciding that she felt fine and was no longer in need of any care. Once\nwe were in the City Party Committee we gave free reign to our tears. We met \nacquaintances, but everyone was somehow divided into two groups, those who \nhadn't been injured, who were clothed, who had brought a pot of food with \nthem, and so on, and those, like me, like Raya, who were wearing whatever had \ncome their way. There were even people who were all made up, dolled up like \nthey had come from a wedding. There were people without shoes, naked people, \nhungry people, those who were crying, and those who had lost someone. And of \ncourse the stories and the talk were flying: "Oh, I heard that they killed \nhim!" "What do you mean they killed him!" "He stayed at work!" "Do you know \nwhat's happening at this and such a plant? Talk like that.\n\nAnd then I met Aleksandr Mikhailovich Gukasian, the teacher. I know him very \nwell and respect him highly. I've known him for a long time. They had a small \nroom, well really it was more like a study-room. We spent a whole night \ntalking in that study once. On March 1 we heard that Bagirov [First Secretary \nof the Communist Party of Azerbaijan SSR] had arrived. Everyone ran to see \nBagirov, what news he had brought with him and how this was all being viewed \nfrom outside. He arrived and everyone went up to him to talk to him and ask \nhim things. Everyone was in a tremendous rage. But he was protected by \nsoldiers, and he went up to the second floor and didn't deign to speak with \nthe people. Apparently he had more important things to do.\n\nSeveral hours passed. Gukasian called me and says, "Lyudochka, find another \ntwo or three. We're going to make up lists, they asked for them upstairs, \nlists of the dead, those whose whereabouts are unknown, and lists of people \nwho had pogroms of their apartments and of those whose cars were burned." I \nhad about 50 people in my list when they called me and said, "Lyuda, your \nMamma has arrived, she's looking for you, she doesn't believe that you are \nalive and well and that you're here." I gave the lists to someone and asked \nthem to continue what I was doing and went off.\n\nThe list was imprecise, of course. It included Grant Adamian, Raya Tovmasian's\nfather, who was alive, but at the time they thought him dead. There was Engels\nGrigorian's father and aunt, Cherkez and Maria. The list also included the \nname of my girlfriend and neighbor, Zhanna Agabekian. One of the guys said \nthat he had been told that they chopped her head off in the courtyard in front\nof the Kosmos movie theater. We put her on the list too, and cried, but later \nit turned out that that was just a rumor, that in fact an hour earlier she had\nsomehow left Sumgait for the marina and from there had set sail for \nKrasnovodsk, where, thank God, she was alive and well. I should also say that \nin addition to those who died that list contained people who were rumored \nmissing or who were so badly wounded that they were given up for dead.                                                                 3\n\nAll the lists were taken to Bagirov. I don't remember how many dead were \ncontained in the list, but it's a fact that when Gukasian came in a couple \nof minutes later he was cursing and was terribly irate. I asked, "What's \ngoing on?" He said, "Lyuda, can you imagine what animals, what scoundrels\nthey are! They say that they lost the list of the dead. Piotr Demichev\n[Member of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party\nof the USSR] has just arrived, and we were supposed to submit the list to\nhim, so that he'd see the scope of the slaughter, of the tragedy, whether it\nwas one or fifty." They told him that the list had disappeared and they\nshould ask everyone who hadn't left for the Khimik boarding house all over\nagain. There were 26 people on our second list. I think that the number 26\nwas the one that got into the press and onto television and the radio, because\nthat's the list that Demichev got. I remember exactly that there were 26 \npeople on the list, I had even told Aleksandr Mikhailovich that that was only \na half of those that were on the first list. He said, "Lyuda, please, try to\nremember at least one more." But I couldn't remember anyone else. But there\nwere more than 30 dead. Of that I am certain. The government and the Procuracy\ndon't count the people who died of fright, like sick people and old people \nwhose lives are threatened by any shock. They weren't registered as victims of\nthe Sumgait tragedy. And then there may be people we didn't know. So many \npeople left Sumgait between March 1 and 8! Most of them left for smaller towns\nin Russia, and especially to the Northern Caucasus, to Stavropol, and the \nKrasnodarsk Territory. We don't have any information on them. I know that \nthere are people who set out for parts around Moscow. In the periodical \nKrestyanka [Woman Farmer] there was a call for people who know how to milk \ncows, and for mechanics, and drivers, and I know a whole group of people went \nto help out. Also clearly not on our list are those people who died entering\nthe city, who were burned in their cars. No one knows about them, except the \nAzerbaijanis, who are hardly likely to say anything about it. And there's\nmore. A great many of the people who were raped were not included in the list \ndrawn up at the Procuracy. I know of three instances for sure, and I of course\ndon't know them all. I'm thinking of three women whose parents chose not to \npublicize what had happened, that is, they didn't take the matter to court, \nthey simply left. But in so doing they didn't cease being victims. One of them\nis the first cousin of my classmate Kocharian. She lived in Microdistrict No. \n8, on the fifth floor. I can't tell you the building number and I don't know \nher name. Then comes the neighbor of one of my relatives, she lived in \nMicrodistrict 1 near the gift shop. I don't know her name, she lives on the \nsame landing as the Sumgait procurator. They beat her father, he was holding \nthe door while his daughter hid, but he couldn't hold the door forever, and \nwhen she climbed over the balcony to the neighbors' they seized her by her \nbraid. Like the Azerbaijanis were saying, it was a very cultured mob, because \nthey didn't kill anyone, they only raped them and left. And the third one \n. . . I don't remember who the third one was anymore.\n\nThey transferred us on March 1. Karina still wasn't herself. Yes, we lived for\ndays in the SK, in the cultural facility, and at the Khimik. They lived there \nand I lived at the City Party Committee because I couldn't stay with Karina; \nit was too difficult for me, but I was at peace: she had survived. I could \nalready walk, but really it was honest words that held me up. Thanks to the \nsocial work I did there, I managed to persevere. Aleksandr Mikhailovich said, \n"If it weren't for the work I would go insane." He and I put ourselves in gear\nand took everything upon ourselves: someone had an infant and needed diapers \nand free food, and we went to get them. The first days we bought everything, \nalthough we should have received it for free. They were supposed to have been \ndispensed free of charge, and they sold it to us. Then, when we found out it \nwas free, we went to Krayev. At the time, fortunately, you could still drop by\nto see him like a neighbor, all the more so since everything was still clearly\nvisible on our faces. Krayev sent a captain down and he resolved the issue.\n\nOn March 2 they sent two investigators to see us: Andrei Shirokov and Vladimir\nFedorovich Bibishev. The way it worked out, in our family they had considered \nonly Karina and me victims, maybe because she and I wound up in the hospital.\nMother and Father are considered witnesses, but not victims.\n\nShirokov was involved with Karina's case, and Bibishev, with mine. After I \ntold him everything, he and I planned to sit down with the identikit and\nrecord everyone I could remember while everything was still fresh in my mind. \nWe didn't work with the identikit until the very last day because the\nconditions weren't there. The investigative group worked slowly and did poor \nquality work solely because the situation wasn't conducive to working: there \nweren't enough automobiles, especially during the time when there was a \ncurfew, and there were no typewriters for typing transcripts, and no still or \nvideo cameras. I think that this was done on purpose. We're not so poor that \nwe can't supply our investigators with all that stuff. It was done especially \nto draw out the investigation, all the more so since the local authorities saw\nthat the Armenians were leaving at the speed of light, never to return to \nSumgait. And the Armenians had a lot to say I came to an agreement with \nBibishev, I told him myself, "Don't you worry, if it takes us a month or two \nmonths, I'll be here. I'm not afraid, I looked death in the eyes five times in\nthose two days, I'll help you conduct the investigation."\n\nHe and I worked together a great deal, and I used this to shelter Karina, I\ngave them so much to do that for a while they didn't have the time to get to\nher, so that she would at least have a week or two to get back to being her-\nself. She was having difficulty breathing so we looked for a doctor to take x-\nrays. She couldn't eat or drink for nine days, she was nauseous. I didn't eat\nand drank virtually nothing for five days. Then, on the fifth day, when we\nwere in Baku already, the investigator told me, "How long can you go on like \nthis? Well fine, so you don't want to eat, you don't love yourself, you're\nnot taking care of yourself, but you gave your word that you would see this\ninvestigation through. We need you." Then I started eating, because in fact I\nwas exhausted. It wasn't enough that I kept seeing those faces in our apart-\nment in my mind, every day I went to the investigative solitary confinement\ncells and prisons. I don't know . . . we were just everywhere! Probably in\nevery prison in the city of Baku and in all the solitary confinement cells of\nSumgait. At that time they had even turned the drunk tank into solitary \nconfinement.\n\nThus far I have identified 31 of the people who were in our apartment. Mamma \nidentified three, and Karina, two. The total is 36. Marina didn't identify \nanyone, she remembers the faces of two or three, But they weren't among the \nphotographs of those detained. I told of the neighbor I recognized. The one \nwho went after the axe. He still hasn't been detained, he's still on the \nloose. He's gone, and it's not clear if he will be found or not. I don't know \nhis first or last name. I know which building he lived in and I know his \nsisters' faces. But he's not in the city. The investigators informed me that \neven if the investigation is closed and even if the trial is over they will \ncontinue looking for him.\n\nThe 31 people I identified are largely blue-collar workers from various \nplants, without education, and of the very lowest level in every respect.\nMostly their ages range from 20 to 30 years; there was one who was 48. Only\none of them was a student. He was attending the Azerbaijan Petroleum and\nChemical Institute in Sumgait, his mother kept trying to bribe the investiga-\ntor. Once, thinking that I was an employee and not a victim, she said in front\nof me "I'll set you up a restaurant worth 500 rubles and give you 600 in cash\nsimply for keeping him out of Armenia," that is, to keep him from landing in\na prison on Armenian soil. They're all terribly afraid of that, because if the\ninvestigator is talking with a criminal and the criminal doesn't confess even\nthough we identified him, they tell him--in order to apply psychological\npressure--they say, "Fine, don't confess, just keep silent. When you're in an\nArmenian prison, when they find out who you are, they'll take care of you\nin short order." That somehow gets to them. Many give in and start to talk.\n\nThe investigators and I were in our apartment and videotaped the entire\npogrom of our apartment, as an investigative experiment. It was only then\nthat I saw the way they had left our apartment. Even without knowing who was \nin our apartment, you could guess. They stole, for example, all the money and \nall the valuables, but didn't take a single book. They tore them up, burned \nthem, poured water on them, and hacked them with axes. Only the Materials\nfrom the 27th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and James \nFenimore Cooper's Last of the Mohigans. Oh yes, lunch was ready, we were \nboiling a chicken, and there were lemons for tea on the table. After they had \nbeen in our apartment, both the chicken and the lemons were gone. That's \nenough to tell you what kind of people were in our apartment, people who don't\neven know anything about books. They didn't take a single book, but they did \ntake worn clothing, food, and even the cheapest of the cheap, worn-out \nslippers.\n\nOf those whom I identified, four were Kafan Azerbaijanis living in Sumgait. \nBasically, the group that went seeking "revenge"--let's use their word for \nit--was joined by people seeking easy gain and thrill-seekers. I talked with \none of them. He had gray eyes, and somehow against the back-drop of all that \nblack I remembered him specifically because of his of his eyes. Besides taking\npart in the pogrom of our apartment, he was also involved in the murder of \nTamara Mekhtiyeva from Building 16. She was an older Armenian who had recently\narrived from Georgia, she lived alone and did not have anyone in Sumgait. I \ndon't know why she had a last name like that, maybe she was married to an \nAzerbaijani. I had laid eyes on this woman only once or twice, and know \nnothing about her. I do know that they murdered her in her apartment with an \naxe. Murdering her wasn't enough for them. They hacked her into pieces and \nthrew them into the tub with water.\n\nI remember another guy really well too, he was also rather fair-skinned. You \nknow, all the people who were in our apartment were darker than dark, both \ntheir hair and their skin. And in contrast with them, in addition to the grey-\neyed one, I remember this one fellow, the one l took to be a Lezgin. I \nidentified him. As it turned out he was Eduard Robertovich Grigorian, born\nin the city of Sumgait, and he had been convicted twice. One of our own. How \ndid I remember him? The name Rita was tattooed on his left or right hand. I \nkept thinking, is that Rita or "puma," which it would be if you read the word \nas Latin characters instead of Cyrillic, because the Cyrillic "T" was the one \nthat looks like a Latin "M." When they led him in he sat with his hands behind\nhis back. This was at the confrontation. He swore on every holy book, tried to\nput in an Armenian word here and there to try and spark my compassion, and \ntold me that I was making a mistake, and called me "dear sister." He said, \n"You're wrong, how could I, an Armenian, raise my hand against my own, an \nArmenian," and so on. He spoke so convincingly that even the investigator \nasked me, "Lyuda, are you sure it was he?" I told him, "I'll tell you one more\nidentifying mark. If I'm wrong I shall apologize and say I was mistaken. The \nname Rita is tattooed on his left or right hand." He went rigid and became \npale. They told him, "Put your hands on the table." He put his hands on the\ntable with the palms up. I said, "Now turn your hands over," but he didn't \nturn his hands over. Now this infuriated me. If he had from the very start\nacknowledged his guilt and said that he hadn't wanted to do it, that they \nforced him or something else, I would have treated him somewhat differently.\nBut he insolently stuck to his story, "No, I did not do anything, it wasn't \nme." When they turned his hands over the name Rita was in fact tattooed on his\nhand. His face distorted and he whispered something wicked. I immediately flew\ninto a rage. There was an ashtray on the table, a really heavy one, made out \nof granite or something, very large, and it had ashes and butts in it. \nCatching myself quite by surprise, I hurled that ashtray at him. But he ducked\nand the ashtray hit the wall, and ashes and butts rained down on his head and \nback. And he smiled. When he smiled it provoked me further. I don't know how, \nbut I jumped over the table between us and started either pounding him or \nstrangling him; I no longer remember which. When I jumped I caught the \nmicrophone cord. The investigator was there, Tolya . . .I no longer recall his\nlast name, and he says, "Lyudochka, it's a Japanese microphone! Please . . .\n" And shut off all the equipment on the spot, it was all being video taped. \nThey took him away. I stayed, and they talked to me a little to calm me down, \nbecause we needed to go on working, I only remember Tolya telling me, "You're \nsome actress! What a performance!" I said, "Tolya, honestly . . . " Beforehand\nthey would always tell me, "Lyuda, more emotion. You speak as calmly as if \nnothing had happened to you." I say, "I don't have any more strength or \nemotion. All my emotions are behind me now, I no longer have the strength \n. . . I don't have the strength to do anything." And he says, "Lyuda, how were\nyou able to do that?" And when I returned to normal, drinking tea and watching\nthe tape, I said, "Can I really have jumped over that table? I never jumped \nthat high in gym class."\n\nSo you could say the gang that took over our apartment was international. Of \nthe 36 we identified there was an Armenian, a Russian, Vadim Vorobyev, who \nbeat Mamma, and 34 Azerbaijanis.\n\nAt the second meeting with Grigorian, when he had completely confessed his \nguilt, he told of how on February 27 the Azerbaijanis had come knocking. Among\nthem were guys--if you can call them guys--he knew from prison. They said, \n"Tomorrow we're going after the Armenians. Meet us at the bus station at three\no'clock." He said, "No, I'm not coming." They told him, "If you don't come \nwe'll kill you." He said, "Alright, I'll come." And he went.\n\nThey also went to visit my classmate from our microdistrict, Kamo Pogosian. He\nhad also been in prison; I think that together they had either stolen a \nmotorcycle or dismantled one to get some parts they needed. They called him \nout of his apartment and told him the same thing: "Tomorrow we're going to get\nthe Armenians. Be there." He said, "No." They pulled a knife on him. He said, \n"I'm not going all the same." And in the courtyard on the 27th they stabbed \nhim several times, in the stomach. He was taken to the hospital. I know he was\nin the hospital in Baku, in the Republic hospital. If we had known about that \nwe would have had some idea of what was to come on the 28th.\n\nI'll return to Grigorian, what he did in our apartment. I remember that he\nbeat me along with all the rest. He spoke Azerbaijani extremely well. But he\nwas very fair-skinned, maybe that led me to think that they had it out for\nhim, too. But later it was proved that he took part in the beating and burning\nof Shagen Sargisian. I don't know if he participated in the rapes in our \napartment; I didn't see, I don't remember. But the people who were in our \napartment who didn't yet know that he was an Armenian said that he did. I \ndon't know if he confessed or not, and I myself don't recall because I blacked\nout very often. But I think that he didn't participate in the rape of Karina\nbecause he was in the apartment the whole time. When they carried her into the\ncourtyard, he remained in the apartment.\n\nAt one point I was talking with an acquaintance about Edik Grigorian. From her\nI learned that his wife was a dressmaker, his mother is Russian, he doesn't \nhave a father, and that he's been convicted twice. Well this will be his third\nand, I hope, last sentence. He beat his wife, she was eternally coming to work\nwith bruises. His wife was an Armenian by the name of Rita.\n\nThe others who were detained . . . well they're little beasts. You really can't\ncall them beasts, they're just little beasts. They were robots carrying out\nsomeone else's will, because at the investigation they all said, "I don't \nunderstand how I could have done that, I was out of my head." But we know that\nthey were won around to it and prepared for it, that's why they did it. In the\nname of Allah, in the name of the Koran, in the name of propagating Islam--\nthat's holy to them--that's why they did everything they were commanded to do.\nBecause I saw they didn't have minds of their own, I'm not talking about their\nlevel of cultural sophistication or any higher values. No education, they\nwork, have a slew of children without the means to raise them properly, they \ncrowd them in, like at the temporary housing, and apparently, they were \npromised that if they slaughtered the Armenians they would receive apartments.\nSo off they went. Many of them explained their participation saying, "they \npromised us apartments."\n\nAmong them was one who genuinely repented. I am sure that he repented from the\nheart and that he just despised himself after the incident. He worked at a \nchildren's home, an Azerbaijani, he has two children, and his wife works at \nthe children's home too. Everything that they acquired, everything that they \nhave they earned by their own labor, and wasn't inherited from parents or \ngrandparents. And he said, "I didn't need anything I just don't know . . . how\nI ended up in that; it was like some hand was guiding me. I had no will of my \nown, I had no strength, no masculine dignity, nothing." And the whole time I\nkept repeating, "Now you imagine that someone did the same to your young wife \nright before your own eyes." He sat there and just wailed.\n\nBut that leader in the Eskimo dogskin coat was not detained. He performed a \nmarvelous disappearing act, but I think that they'll get onto him, they just \nhave to work a little, because that Vadim, that boy, according to his\ngrandfather, is in touch with the young person who taught him what to do, how \nto cover his tracks. He was constantly exchanging jackets with other boys he \nknew and those he didn't, either, and other things as well, and changed \nhimself like a chameleon so they wouldn't get onto him, but he was detained.\n\nThat one in the Eskimo dogskin coat was at the Gambarians' after Aleksandr \nGambarian was murdered. He came in and said, "Let's go, enough, you've spilled\nenough blood here."\n\nMaybe Karina doesn't know this but the reason they didn't finish her off was \nthat they were hoping to take her home with them. I heard this from Aunt Tanya\nand her sons, the Kasumovs, who were in the courtyard near the entryway. They \nliked her very much, and they had decided to take her to home with them. When \nKarina came to at one point--she doesn't remember this yet, this the neighbors \nold me--and she saw that there was no one around her, she started crawling to \nthe entryway. They saw that she was still alive and came back, they were \nalready at the third entryway, on their way to the Gambarians'. They came back\nand started beating her to finish her. If she had not come to she would have \nsustained lesser bodily injuries, they would have beat her less. An older \nwoman from our building, Aunt Nazan, an Azerbaijani, all but lay on top of \nKarina, crying and pleading that they leave her alone, but they flung her off.\nThe woman's grown sons were right nearby; they picked her up in their hands \nand led her home. She howled and cried out loudly and swore: God is on Earth, \nhe sees everything, and He won't forgive this.\n\nThere was another woman, too, Aunt Fatima, a sick, aging woman from the first \nfloor, she's already retired. Mountain dwellers, and Azerbaijanis, too, have a\ncustom: If men are fighting, they throw a scarf under their feet to stop them.\nBut they trampled her scarf and sent her home. To trample a scarf is \ntantamount to trampling a woman's honor.\n\nNow that the investigation is going on, now that a lot is behind us and we \nhave gotten back to being ourselves a little, I think about how could these \nevents that are now called the Sumgait tragedy happen? How did they come \nabout? How did it start? Could it have been avoided? Well, it's clear that \nwithout a signal, without permission from the top leadership, it would not \nhave happened. All the same, I'm not afraid to say this, the Azerbaijanis,\nlet other worthy people take no offense, the better representatives of their \nnations, let them take no offense, but the Azerbaijanis in their majority are \na people who are kept in line only by fear of the law, fear of retribution for\nwhat they have done. And when the law said that they could do all that, like\nunleashed dogs who were afraid they wouldn't have time to do everything, they \nthrew themselves from one thing to the next so as to be able to get more done,\nto snatch a bit more. The smell of the danger was already in the air on\nFebruary 27. You could tell that something was going to happen. And everyone \nwho had figured it out took steps to avoid running into those gangs. Many left\nfor their dachas, got plane tickets for the other end of the country, just got\nas far away as their legs would carry them.\n\nFebruary 27 was a Saturday. I was teaching my third class. The director came \ninto my classroom and said that I should let the children out, that there had \nbeen a call from the City Party Committee asking that all teachers gather for \na meeting at Lenin Square. Well, I excused the children, and there were few \nteachers left at school, altogether three women, the director, and six or \nseven men. The rest had already gone home. We got to Lenin Square and there \nwere a great many people there. This was around five-thirty or six in the \nevening, no later. They were saying all kinds of rubbish up on the podium and \nthe crowd below was supporting them stormily, roaring. They spoke over the \nmicrophone about what had happened in Kafan a few days earlier and that the \ndriver of a bus going to some district had recently thrown a small Azerbaijani\nchild off the bus. The speaker affirmed that he was an eyewitness, that he had\nseen it himself..The crowd started to rage: "Death to the Armenians! They must\nbe killed!" Then a woman went up on stage. I didn't see the woman because \npeople were clinging to the podium like flies. I could only hear her. The \nwoman introduced herself as coming from Kafan, and said that the Armenians \ncut her daughters' breasts off, and called, "Sons, avenge my daughters!" That \nwas enough. A portion of the people on the square took off running in the \ndirection of the factories, toward the beginning of Lenin Street.\n\nWe stood there about an hour. Then the director of School 25 spoke, he gave a \nvery nationalist speech. He said, "Brother Muslims, kill the Armenians!" This \nhe repeated every other sentence. When he said this the crowd supported him \nstormily, whistling and shouting "Karabagh!" He said, "Karabagh has been our \nterritory my whole life long, Karabagh is my soul. How can you tear out my \nheart?" As though an Azerbaijani would die without Karabagh. "It's our \nterritory, the Armenians will never see it. The Armenians must be eliminated. \nFrom time immemorial Muslims have cleansed the land of infidel Armenians, from\ntime immemorial, that's the way nature created it, that every 20 to 30 years \nthe Azerbaijanis should cleanse the land of filth." By filth he meant \nArmenians.\n\nI heard this. Before that I hadn't been listening to the speeches closely.\nMany people spoke and I stood with my back to the podium, talking shop with \nthe other teachers, and somehow it all went right by, it didn't penetrate,\nthat in fact something serious was taking place. Then, when one of our\nteachers said, "Listen to what he's saying, listen to what idiocy he's \nspouting," we listened. That was the speech of that director. Before that we \nlistened to the woman's speech.\n\nRight then in our group--there were nine of us--the mood changed, and the \nsubject of conversation and all school matters were forgotten. Our director of\nstudies, for whom I had great respect, he's an Azerbaijani . . . Before that I\nhad considered him an upstanding and worthy person, if there was a need to \nobtain leave we had asked him, he seemed like a good person. So he tells me,\n"Lyuda, you know that besides you there are no Armenians on the square? If \nthey find out that you're an Armenian they'll tear you to pieces. Should I \ntell them you're an Armenian? Should I tell them you're an Armenian?" When he \nsaid it the first time I pretended not to hear it, and then he asked me a \nsecond time. I turned to the director, Khudurova, and said that it was already\nafter eight, I was expected at home, and I should be leaving. She answered, \n"No, they said that women should stay here until ten o'clock,.and men, until \ntwelve. Stay here." There was a young teacher with us, her children were in \nkindergarten and her husband worked shifts. She asked to leave: "I left my \nchildren at the kindergarten." The director excused her. When she let her go I\nturned around, said, "Good-bye," and left with the young teacher, the \nAzerbaijani. I didn't see them after that.\n\nWhen we were walking the buses weren't running, and a crowd from the rally ran\nnearby us. They had apparently gotten all fired up. It must have become too \nmuch for them, and they wanted to seek vengeance immediately, so they rushed \noff. I wasn't afraid this time because I was sure that the other teacher \nwouldn't say that I was an Armenian.\n\nTo make it short, we reached home. Then Karina told of how they had been at \nthe movies and what had happened there. I started telling of my experience and\nagain my parents didn't understand that we were in danger. We watched \ntelevision as usual, and didn't even imagine that tomorrow would be our last \nday. That's how it all was.\n\nAt the City Party Committee I met an acquaintance, we went to school together,\nZhanna, I don't remember her last name, she lives above the housewares store \non Narimanov Street. She was there with her father, for some reason she \ndoesn't have a mother. The two of them were at home alone. While her father \nheld the door she jumped from the third floor, and she was lucky that the \nground was wet and that there wasn't anyone behind the building when she went \nout on the balcony, there was no one there, they were all standing near the \nentryway. That building was also a lucky one in that there were no murders \nthere. She jumped. She jumped and didn't feel any pain in the heat of the \nmoment. A few days later I found out that she couldn't stand up, she had been \ninjured somehow. That's how people in Sumgait saved their lives, their honor, \nand their children: any way they could. \n\nWhere it was possible, the Armenians fought back. My father's first cousin, \nArmen M., lives in Block 30. They found out by phone from one of the victims \nwhat was going on in town. The Armenians in that building all called one \nanother immediately and all of them armed themselves with axes, knives, even \nwith muskets and went up to the roof. They took their infants with them, and \ntheir old women who had been in bed for God knows how many months, they got \nthem right out of their beds and took everyone upstairs. They hooked \nelectricity up to the trap door to the roof and waited, ready to fight. Then \nthey took the daughter of the school board director hostage, she's an \nAzerbaijani who lived in their building. They called the school board director\nand told her that if she didn't help them, the 17 Armenians on the roof, to \nescape alive and unharmed, she'd never see her daughter again. I'm sure, of \ncourse, that Armenians would never lay a hand on a woman, it was just the only\nthing that could have saved them at the time. She called the police. The \nArmenians made a deal with the local police to go into town. Two armored \npersonnel carriers and soldiers were summoned They surrounded the entryway and\nled everyone down from the roof, and off to the side from the armored \npersonnel carriers was a crowd that was on its way to the building at that \nvery moment, into Block 30. That's how they defended themselves.\n\nI heard that our neighbors, Roman and Sasha Gambarian, resisted. They're big, \nstrong guys. Their father was killed. And I heard that the brothers put up a \nstrong defense and lost their father, but were able to save their mother.\n\nOne of the neighbors told me that after it happened, when they were looking \nfor the criminals on March 1 to 2 and detaining everyone they suspected, \npeople hid people in our entryway, maybe people who were injured or perhaps \ndead. The neighbors themselves were afraid to go there, and when they went \nwith the soldiers into our basement they are supposed to have found \nAzerbaijani corpses. I don't know how many. Even if they had been wounded and \nput down there, after two days they would have died from loss of blood or \ninfection--that basement was filled with water. I heard this from the \nneighbors. And later when I was talking with the investigators the subject \ncame up and they confirmed it. I know, too, that for several hours the \nbasement was used to store objects stolen from our apartment. And our neighbor\ncarried out our carpet, along with the rest: he stole it for himself, posing \nas one of the criminals. Everyone was taking his own share, and the neighbor \ntook his, too, and carried it home. And when we came back, when everything \nseemed to have calmed down, he returned it, saying that it was the only thing \nof ours he had managed to "save."\n\nRaya's husband and father defended themselves. The Trdatovs defended \nthemselves, and so did other Armenian families. To be sure there were\nAzerbaijani victims, although we'll never hear anything about them. For some \nreason our government doesn't want to say that the Armenians were not just \nvictims, but that they defended the honor of their sisters and mothers, too. \nIn the TV show "Pozitsiya" [Viewpoint] a military man, an officer, said that \nthe Armenians did virtually nothing to defend themselves. But that's not \nimportant, the truth will come out regardless.\n\nSo that's the price we paid those three days. For three days our courage, our \nbravery, and our humanity was tested. It was those three days, and not the \nyears and dozens of years we had lived before them, that showed what we've \nbecome, what we grew up to be. Those three days showed who was who.\n\nOn that I will conclude my narrative on the Sumgait tragedy. It should be said\nthat it's not over yet, the trials are still ahead of us, and the punishments\nreceived by those who so violated us, who wanted to make us into nonhumans \nwill depend on our position and on the work of the investigators, the \nProcuracy, and literally of every person who lent his hand to the investiga-\ntion. That's the price we paid to live in Armenia, to not fear going out on \nthe street at night, to not be afraid to say we're Armenians, and to not fear\nspeaking our native tongue.\n\n   October 15,1988\n   Yerevan\n\n			- - - reference for #008 - - -\n\n[1] _The Sumgait Tragedy; Pogroms against Armenians in Soviet Azerbaijan,\n    Volume I, Eyewitness Accounts_, edited by Samuel Shahmuradian, forward by\n    Yelena Bonner, 1990, published by Aristide D.

Let us not forget about the genocide of the Azeri people in 'Karabag' \nand x-Soviet Armenia by the Armenians. Between 1914 and 1920, Armenians \ncommitted unheard-of crimes, resorted to all conceivable methods of \ndespotism, organized massacres, poured petrol over babies and burned \nthem, raped women and girls in front of their parents who were bound \nhand and foot, took girls from their mothers and fathers and appropriated \npersonal property and real estate. And today, they put Azeris in the most \nunbearable conditions any other nation had ever known in history.\n                               \n\nAREF  SADIKOV sat  quietly  in the  shade of  a  cafe-bar on  the\nCaspian Sea  esplanade of Baku and  showed a line of  stitches in\nhis trousers, torn  by an Armenian bullet as he  fled the town of\nHojali just over three months ago, writes Hugh Pope.\n\n"I'm still  wearing the same  clothes, I don't have  any others,"\nthe  51-year-old carpenter  said,  beginning his  account of  the\nHojali disaster. "I was wounded in five places, but I am lucky to\nbe alive."\n\nMr Sadikov and  his wife were short of  food, without electricity\nfor more than a month, and cut off from helicopter flights for 12\ndays. They  sensed the  Armenian noose was tightening  around the\n2,000 to  3,000 people left in  the straggling Azeri town  on the\nedge of Karabakh.\n\n"At about 11pm  a bombardment started such as we  had never heard\nbefore,  eight  or  nine   kinds  of  weapons,  artillery,  heavy\nmachine-guns, the lot," Mr Sadikov said.\n\nSoon neighbours were  pouring down the street  from the direction\nof  the  attack. Some  huddled  in  shelters but  others  started\nfleeing the town,  down a hill, through a stream  and through the\nsnow into a forest on the other side.\n\nTo escape, the  townspeople had to reach the Azeri  town of Agdam\nabout 15  miles away. They  thought they  were going to  make it,\nuntil at  about dawn  they reached a  bottleneck between  the two\nArmenian villages of Nakhchivanik and Saderak.\n\n"None of my group was hurt up to then ... Then we were spotted by\na  car on  the road,  and the  Armenian outposts  started opening\nfire," Mr Sadikov said.\n\nAzeri militiamen fighting their way  out of Hojali rushed forward\nto force  open a  corridor for the  civilians, but  their efforts\nwere mostly  in vain.  Mr Sadikov  said only  10 people  from his\ngroup of  80 made it  through, including his wife  and militiaman\nson.  Seven  of  his  immediate  relations  died,  including  his\n67-year-old elder brother.\n\n"I only had time to reach down  and cover his face with his hat,"\nhe said, pulling his own big  flat Turkish cap over his eyes. "We\nhave never got any of the bodies back."\n\nThe first groups were lucky to have the benefit of covering fire.\nOne hero  of the  evacuation, Alif  Hajief, was  shot dead  as he\nstruggled to change  a magazine while covering  the third group's\ncrossing, Mr Sadikov said.\n\nAnother hero,  Elman Memmedov, the  mayor of Hojali, said  he and\nseveral others  spent the whole day  of 26 February in  the bushy\nhillside, surrounded by  dead bodies as they tried  to keep three\nArmenian armoured personnel carriers at bay.\n\nAs the  survivors staggered the  last mile into Agdam,  there was\nlittle comfort  in a town from  which most of the  population was\nsoon to flee.\n\n"The night  after we reached  the town  there was a  big Armenian\nrocket attack. Some people just  kept going," Mr Sadikov said. "I\nhad to  get to the  hospital for treatment. I  was in a  bad way.\nThey even found a bullet in my sock."\n\nVictims of  war: An  Azeri woman  mourns her  son, killed  in the\nHojali massacre in February  (left).

That's why zoologists refer to you as a 'fecal shield'. Colonel Semen \nM. Budienny, a subsequent Soviet military fame, said about the \nArmenian genocide of 2.5 million defenseless Turkish and Kurdish \nwomen, children and elderly people during his visit to Anatolia \nin June 1919 that\n\n"the Armenians had become troublemakers, their Hinchakist\n and Dashnakist parties were opportunist, serving as lackeys\n of whatever power happened to be ascendent."\n\nIn September 16, 1920, Major General W. Thwaites, Director of\nMilitary Intelligence, wrote to Lord Hardinge, Under-Secretary\nof State for Foreign Affairs:\n\n"...it is useless to pretend that the Armenians are satisfactory\n allies, or deserving of all the sympathy to which they claim."[1]\n\n[1] F.O. 331/3411/158288.\n\nIn the Special Collection at Stanford Hoover Library, donated by\nGeorgia Cutler, the letter dated Nov. 1, 1943 states that\n\n"Prescot Hall wrote a large volume to prove that Armenians were\n not and never could be desirable citizens, that they would \n always be unscrupulous merchants."\n\n\nSource: Documents: Volume I (1919).\n        "Document No: 50," Archive No: 4/3621, Cabin No: 162, Drawer \n        No: 5, File No: 2905, Section No: 433, Contents No: 6, 6-1, 6-2.\n        (To 36th Division Command - Militia Commander Ismail Hakki)\n\n"For eight days, Armenians have been forcibly obstructing people from\n leaving their homes or going from one village to the other.

It was shafting on the part of the Arab land owners for doing it \nwithout notifying their tenant farmers and for not being responsible \nenough to make provisions for them, but rather just leaving\nthem to their fate.\n\nThe point is that the land was sold legally, often at prices\nabove its actual value.  It was legal, and good business for\nthe sellers, though it left the Palestinians who worked the land\nin a poor situation.  \n\nI don't know if others share this opinion.  It is mine,\nand I'm sure there are some who agree and some who don't\nThe way I see it, the fallahin were caught in circumstances \nbeyond their control, in that since they didn't own the land,\nthey didn't have a say. Of course, now for the sake of the "greater \nArab unity" the Arabs are angry that the land was sold to the Jews\n(an act that is illegal in Jordan), but when it happened, it was just \nbusiness.   \n\nThe purpose of buying the land was to provide space and jobs for \nJewish immigrants.  In any case, no matter what the purpose, \nthe sales were legal, so I really don't see any grounds for \ncontesting them.
From: Center for Policy Research <cpr>\nSubject: Hebrew labor: racist connotations\n\n\nAVODA IVRIT - HEBREW LABOR\n---------------------------------\n\n"Hebrew labor" is a concept which has served the Zionist movement\nfor a long time.  It has a double-barreled message: 1) The new Jew\nmust learn to do physical labor, i.e. working the land; 2) The\nland in this country must pass into Jewish hands, i.e. to the same\nnew Jew who has "learned" to work it. Both aspects of the\ntwo-pronged concept of "Hebrew labor" have racist connotations. On\nthe one hand, the diaspora Jew's lack of training in physical\nlabor is a myth shared by Zionists and antisemites.  On the other\nhand, its meaning in practice has been the displacement of the\nArab farmer from the source of his livelihood.\n\nThe occupation and the cheap Palestinian labor which streamed from\nthe occupied territories to the factories, orchards, and\nhot-houses of Israel relegated the myth of "Hebrew labor" to the\nhistory books and nostalgic memories of the Zionist Movement. It\nhas blossomed forth anew, however, as the government's answer to\nproblems caused by the closure of the territories. Today too this\nconcept has two functions: 1) to give a progressive look to the\nclosing of the Palestinian population.  Or in the words of\nEnvironment Minister Yossi Sarid, "I have no tears for those who\nget rich off of cheap labor". 2) to furnish an answer to the\nunemployed Israeli who complains of being obliged to work for\nwages that are lower than the unemployment insurance he receives.
Never. I don't know whether anybody formulated and proposed such an \nindex or criteria to determine the magnitude of a genocide as mentioned \nand advised by Toynbee. If one ever does you will easily see the magnitude \nof the crime of genocide committed by the Armenians, by massacring an alien\npopulation under their rule which constituted about 40% of their total\npopulation and they did it only within a time period of a little over\ntwo years in which they enjoyed having full control over this population.\n\nNow I would like to ask you:\n\n  Is there any other genocide in the history of mankind similar to \n  this one?\n\nAnd again I would like to ask you:\n\n  Whether the silent and unmourned martyrdom of these hundreds of thousands\n  of Turks of the Republic of Armenia who were exterminated as a "Final\n  Solution" to Turco-Tartar problems in Armenia is similar or not\n  to the martyrdom of six million Jews in Europe as a final solution to\n  Jewish problems?\n\n\nSerdar Argic

Still living in an alternate universe? Numerous articles in major newspapers \n(London Times) and periodicals (Newsweek) during the war, had suggested \nthe existence of a significant collaboration between Armenians and the \nNazis. Arthur Derounian deserves credit for being the first person to \ndeal with this issue extensively. Derounian's motives were twofold: his \ndeeply held democratic convictions gave him a sense of duty and he felt \nobliged to shed light on this yet another dark chapter of Armenian history.\nConcurrently, Derounian embarked on what one would call 'crisis control' \nor face-saving. In order to forestall any potential attacks on the larger \nArmenian community in the United States, he marginalized collaboration \nas deplorable but insignificant.[1]\n\n[1] John Roy Carlson (real name Arthur Derounian), 'The Plotters,'\n    E. P. Dutton & Company, Inc., New York 1946, p. 182.\n\n\n Source: "Mitteilungsblatt, Berlin, December 1939, Nr. 2 and 5-6"\n\n Yet another historical fact: a fact that for years has been deliberately \n forgotten, concealed, and wiped from memory - the fact of Armenian-Nazi \n collaboration.\n\n A magazine called Mitteilungsblatt der Deutsch-Armenischen Gesselschaft\n is the clearest and most definite proof of this collaboration. The \n magazine was first published in Berlin in 1938 during Nazi rule of Germany\n and continued publication until the end of 1944. Even the name of the\n magazine, which implies a declaration of Armenian-Nazi cooperation,\n is attention-getting.\n\n This magazine, every issue of which proves the collaboration, is historically\n important as documentary evidence. It is a heap of writing that should be\n an admonition to world opinion and to all mankind. \n\n In Nazi Germany, Armenians were considered to be an Aryan race and certain\n political, economic, and social rights were thus granted to them. They \n occupied positions in public service and were partners in Nazi practices.\n The whole world of course knows what awaited those who were not considered \n "Aryan" and what befell them.\n\nNow wait, there is more.\n\nSource: "From Sardarapat to Sevres and Lausanne" by Avetis Aharonian.

'SDPA.ORG' criminals/Nazis in action. Your fascist government got away with \nthe genocide of 2.5 million Turkish men, women and children and is enjoying \nthe fruits of that genocide. And your criminal organization will not get away \nwith the genocide's cover-up. In June 1915, a major uprising took place in \nSebinkarahisar under the leadership of the famous Nazi Boyadjian. The Moslem \ndistricts were burnt down. Hundreds of soldiers and gendarmerie were killed\nand hundreds of civilians also perished.\n\n   Armenians first of all occupied the Talori region, which included \n   the villages of Siner, Simai, Gulli-Guzat, Ahi, Hedenk, Sinank,\n   Ekind, Effard, Musson, Etek, Akcesser. Leaving their wives, \n   children and property in these inaccessible spots, the Armenians \n   joined forces with other armed bands coming from the Silvan \n   districts in the plain of Mus, after which the whole body of\n   3000 men gathered in the Andok Mt. Five or six hundred wished\n   to surround Mus, and started off by attacking the Delican tribe to\n   the south of the city. They slaughtered a number of the tribe and\n   seized their goods. The religious beliefs of the Muslims who fell\n   into their hands were derided and disparaged, and the Muslims\n   themselves murdered in the most frightful manner. The rebels\n   also attacked the regular troops in the vicinity of Mus, but the\n   large numbers of the regular forces prevented them from\n   occupying the city.\n\n   The rebels joined the bandits in the Andok Mts., carrying out\n   the most frightful massacres and looting among the tribes of the\n   neighbourhood. They burned Omer Agha's nephew alive. They\n   raped a number of Turkish women at a spot three or four hours'\n   distance from Gulli-Guzat and then strangled them.\n\n   At the beginning of August the rebels attacked the Faninar,\n   Bekiran and Badikan tribes, perpetrating equally horrible\n   atrocities. The rebels in the villages of Yermut and Ealigernuk in\n   the nahiye of Cinan in the kaza of Cal attacked the Kurds in the\n   neighbourhood, as well as the villages of Kaisser and Catcat.\n\n   Towards the end of August, the Armenians attacked the\n   Kurds in the vicinity of Mus and burned down three or four\n   villages, including Gulli-Guzat. As for the 3000 rebels in Talori,\n   they continued to spread death and destruction among the\n   Muslims and other Christian communities, refusing to lay down\n   their arms. \n\nSource: Uras, Esat: The Armenians in History.

It\n			 esp for political purposes.\n			 It sounds more like your guys...\n\n\nYeah? Well,I guess you were in there,and you know it all...\n\n                             ^^^^^^^^^^---\/\n                           Where from do you know that it was "on purpose"?\n			   Personally,I didn't hear about this case,although\n			   I don't deny it.But how can ANYBODY,besides the\n			   person itself,can say it was "on purpose"?\n\n\nYeah,sure.The truck driver looked in the car with his Zionist Equipment of\nDetecting Palestinian Children,and then he thought to himself:Hey there is a\n5 year  and 2 weeks girls in the car.Why won't I make an accident and kill\nthe "enemy"? Maximum I will die too in the crash...But what do I care?...\n\n\nWell,It was about 3 years ago ,in the Intifada (The fact that  you can't\nremember the time prooves how much do you care about it). I DO NOT think\nthat what the soliders did was correct. But I will not agree that they "were\nbreaking their arms".I saw that film,and,unlike in the USA,it was broadcasted\nentirely not long ago (in a talk show) and at the end the "arm-broken" guys got\nup and walked and used their arms very good. They guy who did it was interviewed\nand he said he did it because the terrorist or whatever he was refused to take\nhis orders,and spitted in his face. What ammount of truth exist in this\nstatement I cannot tell you,because I wasn't there. But the guy who did it was\nin prison,if it makes you any good.\n\n\nNo,it didn't. The Israeli army is still the most important army in the midlle\neast.It is still the only human army(as much as an ARMY can be human).To any\nAmerican who will claim the opposite,I can only remember the CNN broadcasting\nof the American Solider who beat a Somalian boy. It was very cruel to see.But\nI won't say because of this that the American army is cruel.\n\n\nSome kind of proof! "Obvious"? Where from? If you say it is behind the scenes,\nhow do you know about it?\n\n\n\nI just wanted to show how much garbadge one can say,without knowing ANYTHING\nabout what he says,and living a life far away from the place he talks about.
It was announced on NPR 4/17/93 10:00 am EDT, that Turkish President Ozal died \nof a heart attack in Ankara.
First let me correct myself in that it was Goerbels and\nnot Goering (Airforce) who ran the Nazi propaganda machine. I\nagree that Arab news sources are also inherently biased. But I\nbelieve the statement I was reacting to was that since the\namerican accounts of events are not fully like the Israeli\naccounts, the Americans are biased. I just thought that the\nIsraelis had more motivation for bias.\n	The UN has tried many times to condemn Israel for its\ngross violation of human rights. However the US has vetoed most\nsuch attempts. It is interesting to note that the U.S. is often\nthe only country opposing such condemnation (well the U.S. and\nIsrael). It is also interesting to note that that means\nother western countries realize these human rights violations.\nSo maybe there are human rights violations going on after all.
Pardon me?\n\n"Greece Government Rail-Roads Two Turkish Ethnic Deputies"\n\nWhile World Human Rights Organizations Scream, Greeks \nPersistently Work on Removing the Parliamentary Immunity\nof Dr. Sadik Ahmet and Mr. Ahmet Faikoglu.\n\n\nDr. Sadik Ahmet, Turkish Ethnic Member of Greek Parliament, Visits US\n\nWashington DC, July 7- Doctor Sadik Ahmet, one of the two ethnic\nTurkish members of the Greek parliament visited US on june 24 through\nJuly 5th and held meetings with human rights organizations and\nhigh-level US officials in Washington DC and New York.\n\nAt his press conference at the National Press Club in Washington DC,\nSadik Ahmet explained the plight of ethnic Turks in Greece and stated\nsix demands from Greek government.\n\nAhmet said "our only hope in Greece is the pressure generated from\nWestern capitals for insisting that Greece respects the human rights.\nWhat we are having done to ethnic Turks in Greece is exactly the same\nas South African Apartheid." He added: "What we are facing is pure\nGreek hatred and racial discrimination."\n\nSpelling out the demands of the Turkish ethnic community in Greece\nhe said "We want the restoration of Greek citizenship of 544 ethnic\nTurks. Their citizenship was revoked by using the excuse that this\npeople have stayed out of Greece for too long. They are Greek citizens\nand are residing in Greece, even one of them is actively serving in\nthe Greek army. Besides, other non-Turkish citizens of Greece are\nnot subject to this kind of interpretation at an extent that many of\nGreek-Americans have Greek citizenship and they permanently live in\nthe United States."\n\n"We want guarantee for Turkish minority's equal rights. We want Greek\ngovernment to accept the Turkish minority and grant us our civil rights.\nOur people are waiting since 25 years to get driving licenses. The Greek\ngovernment is not granting building permits to Turks for renovating\nour buildings or building new ones. If your name is Turkish, you are\nnot hired to the government offices."\n\n"Furthermore, we want Greek government to give us equal opportunity\nin business. They do not grant licenses so we can participate in the\neconomic life of Greece. In my case, they denied me a medical license\nnecessary for practicing surgery in Greek hospitals despite the fact\nthat I have finished a Greek medical school and followed all the\nnecessary steps in my career."\n\n"We want freedom of expression for ethnic Turks. We are not allowed\nto call ourselves Turks. I myself have been subject of a number of\nlaw suits and even have been imprisoned just because I called myself\na Turk."\n\n"We also want Greek government to provide freedom of religion."\n\nIn separate interview with The Turkish Times, Dr. Sadik Ahmet stated\nthat the conditions of ethnic Turks are deplorable and in the eyes of\nGreek laws, ethnic Greeks are more equal than ethnic Turks. As an example,\nhe said there are about 20,000 telephone subscribers in Selanik (Thessaloniki)\nand only about 800 of them are Turks. That is not because Turks do not\nwant to have telephone services at their home and businesses. He said\nthat Greek government changed the election law just to keep him out\nof the parliament as an independent representative and they stated\nthis fact openly to him. While there is no minimum qualification\nrequirement for parties in terms of receiving at least 3% of the votes,\nthey imposed this requirement for the independent parties, including\nthe Turkish candidates.\n\nAhmet was born in a small village at Gumulcine (Komotini), Greece 1947.\nHe earned his medical degree at University of Thessaloniki in 1974.\nhe served in the Greek military as an infantryman.\n\nIn 1985 he got involved with community affairs for the first time\nby collecting 15,000 signatures to protest the unjust implementation\nof laws against ethnic Turks. In 1986, he was arrested by the police\nfor collecting signatures.\n\n\nSerdar Argic

It's irritating when someone mis-labels "us" as "fundamentalists",\nisn't it?  This sort of thing may help us understand why some muslims \nrather resent being put under this label.

Are you trying to say that there were no massacres in Deir Yassin\nor in Sabra and Shatila? If so then let me tell you some good jokes:\n\nThere is not and was not any such thing like jewish killing in WWII\n\nPalestinians just did what Davidians did for fourty years and more.\n\nIn fact no one was killed in any war at any time or any place.\n\nPeople die that is all.

Like it or not, Edward, Anwar has a very good, valid point.  Obviously,\nin presenting it, he (quite legitimately and deliberately) takes a point\nof view to an extreme which might not have been what you intended, but\nthat is one of the best ways to demonstrate a "slippery slope" type of\nargument, which I believe was his aim.\n\nI very frankly believe that the ADL will be proved innocent in this\ncase.  I doubt there's enough evidence to weigh against them even in a\ncivil court, where preponderance of the evidence, not evidence beyond\nany reasonable doubt, is the standard for "winning" such a case.  That,\nhowever, does not prevent me from seeing the merit in Anwar's point. \n\nRest deleted.
In the South Lebanon area, only Israeli (and SLA) and Lebanese troops \nare present.\nSyrian troops are deployed north of the Awali river.

Hopefully a comprehensive peace settlement\nwill be concluded soon, and will include security guarantees for\nboth sides.  My proposal was aimed at decreasing the casualties\nin the interim period.

Los Angeles Times, Tuesday, April 13, 1993.  P. A1.\n\nNEW DETAILS OF EXTENSIVE ADL SPY OPERATION EMERGE\n\n	* INQUIRY: Transcripts reveal nearly 40 years of espionage\n	  by a man who infiltrated political groups\n\nBy Richard C. Paddock, Times staff writer.\n\nSAN FRANCISCO -- To the outside world, Roy Bullock was a small-time\nart dealer who operated from his house in the Castro District.  In\nreality, he was an undercover spy who picked through garbage and\namassed secret files for the Anti-Defamation League for nearly 40\nyears.\n\nHis code name at the prominent Jewish organization was Cal, and he was\nso successful at infiltrating political groups that he was once chosen\nto head an Arab-American delegation that visited Rep. Nancy Pelosi\n(D-San Francisco) in her Washington, D.C., office.\n\nFor a time, Cal tapped into the phone message system of the White\nAryan Resistance to learn of hate crimes.  From police sources he\nobtained privileged, personal information on at least 1,394 people. \nAnd he met surreptitiously with agents of the South African government\nto trade his knowledge for crisp, new $100 bills.\n\nThese are among the secrets that Bullock and David Gurvitz, a former\nLos Angeles-based operative, divulged in extensive interviews with\npolice and the FBI in a growing scandal over the nation-wide\nintelligence network operated by the Anti-Defamation League.\n\nOfficials of the Anti-Defamation League, while denying any improper\nactivity, have said they will cooperate with the investigation.  They\nhave refused to discuss Bullock and Gurvitz.\n\nTranscripts of the interviews -- among nearly 700 pages of documents\nreleased by San Francisco prosecutors last week -- offer new details\nof the private spy operation that authorities allege crossed the line\ninto illegal territory.\n\nAt times, the intelligence activities took on a cloak-and-dagger air\nwith laundered payments, shredded documents, hotel rendezvous with\nforeign agents and code names like "Ironsides" and "Flipper."\n\nOn one occasion, Gurvitz recounts, he received a tip that a\npro-Palestinian activist was about to board a plane bound for Haifa,\nIsrael.  Although the Anti-Defamation League publicly denies any ties\nto Israel, Gurvitz phoned an Israeli consular official to warn him. \nShortly afterward, another official called Gurvitz back and debriefed\nhim.\n\nThe court papers also added to the mystery of Tom Gerard, a former CIA\nagent and San Francisco police officer accused of providing\nconfidential material from police files to the Anti-Defamation League.\n\nGerard fled to the Philippines last fall after he was interviewed by\nthe FBI, but left behind a briefcase in his police locker.  Its\ncontents included passports, driver's licenses and identification\ncards in 10 different names; identification cards in his own name for\nfour American embassies in Central America; and a collection of blank\nbirth certificates, Army discharge papers and official stationery from\nvarious agencies.\n\nAlso in the briefcase were extensive information on death squads, a\nblack hood, apparently for use in interrogations, and photos of\nblindfolded and chained men.\n\nInvestigators suspect that Gerard and other police sources gave the\nADL confidential driver's license or vehicle registration information\non a vast number of people, including as many as 4,500 members of one\ntarget group, the Arab-American Anti-Discrimination Committee.\n\nEach case of obtaining such data from a law enforcement officer would\nconstitute a felony, San Francisco Police Inspector Ron Roth noted in\nan affidavit for a search warrant.\n\nThe Anti-Defamation League, a self-described Jewish defense and civil\nrights organization, acknowledges it has long collected information on\ngroups that are anti-Semitic, extremist or racist. The ADL's\nfact-finding division, headed by Irwinn Suall in New York, enjoys a\nreputation for thoroughness and has often shared its information with\npolice agencies and journalists. \n\nHowever, evidence seized from Bullock's computer shows he kept files\non at least 950 groups of all political stripes, including the\nAmerican Civil Liberties Union, Earth Island Institute, the United\nFarm Workers, Jews for Jesus, Mother Jones magazine, the Center for\nInvestigative Reporting, the Bo Gritz for President Committee, the\nAsian Law Caucus and the AIDS activist group ACT UP.\n\nThe computer files also included information on several members of\nCongress, including Pelosi, House Armed Services Committee Chairman\nRon Dellums (D-Berkeley) and former Republican Rep. Pete McCloskey\nfrom the Bay Area.\n\nIn their statements, Bullock and Gurvitz said the Anti-Defamation\nLeague has collected information on political activists in the Los\nAngeles area for more than 30 years.  They said they worked closely\nwith three Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies who specialized in\nintelligence work, a Los Angeles Police Department anti-terrorism\nexpert and a San Diego County Sheriff's Department intelligence\nofficer.\n\nA spokesman for the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department said he knew\nnothing of any contact between the deputies and the ADL.  The Los\nAngeles Police Department, which earlier refused to cooperate with the\ninvestigation, and the San Diego Sheriff's Department declined\ncomment.\n\nBullock, 58, is one of the most intriguing characters in the spy\ndrama.  Although he is not Jewish, he began working undercover as a\nvolunteer for the ADL and the FBI in Indiana in 1954 after reading a\nbook about a man who infiltrated the Communist Party.\n\nBullock moved to Los Angeles in 1960 and was given a paid position by\nthe ADL as an intelligence operative, he told authorities.  In the\nmid-1970s, he moved to San Francisco and continued his spy operations\nup and down the West Coast.\n\nTo keep his identity secret, his salary has always been funneled\nthrough Beverly Hills attorney Bruce I. Hochman -- who has never\nmissed a payment in more than 32 years, Bullock said.\n\n"I was an investigator for the ADL.  I investigated any and all\nanti-democratic movements," Bullock said.  ". . . Officially, I'm only\na contract worker with Bruce Hochman.  That way, the league would not\nbe officially connected with me."\n\nBullock said he became a master at infiltrating groups from Communists\nto Arab-American to gay radicals to skinheads, usually using his own\nname but once adopting the alias Elmer Fink.\n\n"I'm one of a kind," he told police.\n\nIn recent years, however, his ADL affiliation has increasingly become\nknown, and at one point he was confronted by a skinhead armed with a\nshotgun who threatened to kill him.\n\nIn the mid-1980s, he helped San Francisco police solve a bombing at a\nsynagogue by combing through the trash of extremist Cory Phelps and\nmatching handwriting with samples on a threatening letter obtained by\npolice.  In part because of this investigation, he became close\nfriends with Gerard, who at the time was working in the San Francisco\npolice intelligence division.\n\nBullock frequently searched through the garbage of target groups.  An\nFBI report noted how he investigated one Palestinian group:\n\n"Bullock would write reports based on what he found in the trash, and\nwould share the reports with Gerard.  Bullock also gave the trash to\nGerard for Gerard to examine.  Gerard would later return the trash to\nBullock."\n\nFrom a wide range of sources, Bullock compiled files on 9,876\nindividuals and more than 950 political groups.  Gerard, whose files\ncontained many identical entries, kept files on 7,011 people.\n\nIn 1987, Bullock and Gerard began selling some of their vast wealth of\ninformation to the South African government.  Bullock tells of\nmeetings secretly with South African agents at San Francisco hotels\nand receiving envelopes filled with thousands of dollars in new $100\nbills.\n\nBullock insists the information he sold consisted of data he culled\nonly from public sources. Once he rewrote an innocuous item published\nby San Francisco Chronicle columnist Herb Caen about South African\nBishop Desmond Tutu and the wife of prominent attorney Melvin Belli --\nand submitted it as his own work.\n\nBullock said it was Gerard who sold official police intelligence. \nBullock said he split about $16,000 from the South African government\nevenly with Gerard, telling him at one point, "I may be gay but I'm a\nstraight arrow."\n\nIn his interviews with the police and FBI, Bullock talked freely about\nengaging in certain activities that prosecutors say would appear to\nviolate the law.\n\nFor example, Bullock admitted to receiving driver's license records\nand criminal histories from Gerard on about 50 people -- a fraction of\nthe confidential police data found in his computer.  And he said\nGerard gave him complete San Francisco Police Department intelligence\nfiles on various Nazi groups that were supposed to be destroyed under\ndepartment policy.\n\nBullock said he also received a confidential FBI report on the Nation\nof Islam that he later shredded at the Anti-Defamation League's San\nFrancisco office.\n\nBullock seemed proud of his "Operation Eavesdrop," in which he used a\npaid informant, code-named Scumbag, to help tap into a White Aryan\nResistance phone message network, listening to the messages left by\nmembers of the right-wing group.  "For a short time, it was\nwonderful," he told police.\n\nIn Los Angeles, ADL operative Gurvitz was hired about four years ago\nas a "fact-finder" to keep intelligence files and occasionally go\nundercover to the meetings of target groups.\n\nAmong other things, he told San Francisco authorities, the Los Angeles\nADL office kept a record of any Arab-American who had "anti-Israel\nleanings" or who wrote a letter to a newspaper expressing such\nsentiment.\n\nGurvitz was recently forced to resign after an incident in which he\nattempted to misuse the ADL intelligence network to seek revenge on a\nrival who got a job Gurvitz wanted at the Simon Wiesenthal Center for\nHolocaust Studies.  Gurvitz got confidential police data on the rival\nand threatened to expose him as a Jewish spy to a right-wing hate\ngroup.\n\nGurvitz has since begun cooperating with police and the FBI in the\nprobe, providing considerable information about the ADL operation. \nUnlike Bullock, he has been assured he is not a subject of the\ninvestigation.\n\nGurvitz declined through his father in Los Angeles to be interviewed\nby The Times.

Let's face it, if the words don't get into your noggin in the first place, \nthere's no hope. Now tell us, 'SDPA.ORG', a mouthpiece of the fascist x-Soviet \nArmenian Government: what was your role in the murder of Orhan Gunduz and \nKemal Arikan? How many more Muslims will be slaughtered by 'SDPA.ORG' as \npublicly declared and filed with the legal authorities? \n\n\n "...that more people have to die..." \n\n                    SDPA <91@urartu.UUCP>\n\n  "Yes, I stated this and stand by it."\n\n                    SDPA <255@urartu.UUCP>\n\n\n    	January 28, 1982 - Los Angeles\n	Kemal Arikan is slaughtered by two Armenians while driving to work. \n\n    	March 22, 1982 - Cambridge, Massachusetts\n	Prelude to grisly murder.

Boghosian, "Radical Group Hosts Well-Attended Solidarity\nMeeting," The Armenian Reporter, May 1, 1986, pp. 1 & 18.\n\nATHENS, Greece - An array of representatives of Greek political parties,\nincluding the ruling PASOK party, and a host of political groups, both\nArmenian and non-Armenian, joined to voice their solidarity with the \nArmenian people in their pursuit of their cause and activities of a new\nArmenian political force were voiced here on Sunday, April 20 during\nthe 2nd International Meeting of Solidarity with the Armenian People. And\njudging from encouraging messages offered by the representatives of these\npolitical groups and organizations, at least here in Greece, the Armenian\nCause enjoys abundant support from a wide spectrum of the political world.\n\nThe International Meeting of Solidarity was sponsored by the Greek branch of\nthe Armenian Popular Movement, a comparatively new political force headed\nby younger generations of Armenians, who openly profess their support of the\narmed struggle and of the Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia\n(ASALA). The organization has branches in various European and Middle Eastern\ncountries and the United States although some of these branches appear to\nhave gone through a switch of loyalties because of the split within the ranks\nof ASALA...\n\nVoicing the support of PASOK, the ruling party in Greece, to the Armenian\npeople, was Mr. Charalambidi Michalis, a member of the Central Committee of\nthe party and the Greek member of the Permanent People's Tribunal...\nExplaining the goals and aspirations of the Armenian Popular Movement \nwas Ara Sarkisian. Significant was the address delivered by Mr. Bassam \nAbu-Salim, on behalf of the Popular Front for the movement's continued \nsupport of the Armenians' armed struggle in their pursuit of their cause, \npledging that Palestinian operated and run training camps would always be \nopen to Armenian youth who need training for such a struggle. Later, Mr. \nAbu-Salim, answering a question put to him by this writer, affirmed that \nhis organization had always trained Armenian members of ASALA and that\nthis policy will continue. "The doors of our camps are always open to \nArmenian freedom fighters," he affirmed.\n\nAmong the prominent Greek politicians who attended the conference was the son\nof Prime Minister Papandreou, who himself holds a post in the Greek cabinet;\ntwo members of the Cypriot Parliament who had journeyed to Athens for the\nspecific purpose of attending the international gathering; representatives of\nthe Christian Democratic party, EDIK Center party, two wings of the Communist\nparty, representatives of an assortment of labor unions and trade associations,\na number of mayors of Greek towns and cities; two Greek members of the\nEuropean Parliament and other members of the Greek Parliament were also among\nthose who participated in the international conference. Also on hand to follow\nthe deliberations was the ambassador of Bulgaria in Athens.\n\nMore than significant was the large number of messages received by the \norganizers, including the following: Palestinian National Revolutionary\nMovement, Fatah; Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General\nCommand; the Central Committee of the Palestinian National Liberation\nMovement-Fatah; the Socialist Progressive Party of Lebanon; Arab Socialist\nLabor Party; the Kurdistan Democratic Union of Iraq; and numerous other\ninternational groups, all noted for their radical stand in the Israeli-\nPalestinian conflict.\n\n                 SUPPORT FROM ARF-RM\n\nAmong messages received from Armenian groups was the Armenian Revolutionary\nFederation-Revolutionary Movement, the group that has claimed the abduction\nand assassination of key party leaders in Lebanon accused of selling out to\nforeign interests and powers. The message clearly gave its support to the\nArmenian Popular Movement pledging that the Revolutionary movement will\ncontinue to "reveal the realities, no matter how bitter or tragic they are,"\nto expose the anti-Armenian activities of the leaders of the Dashnag "Bureau."\nThe message was taken as an indication of the link, loose as it may be, that\nexists between the dissident Dashnag group and the Armenian Popular Movement,\nopen supporters of ASALA and armed struggle.\n\nThe Armenian Popular Movement has set up its headquarters in a suburb of the\nGreek capital, known as Neos Kosmos, where there is a large Armenian presence.\nThe headquarters are located in a two-story building, which appears to have\nturned into a beehive of activity on the part of scores of Armenian youth, who\nprefer to give their first names only when invited to introduce themselves...\n\nNow any comment?\n\n#From: vd8@cunixb.cc.columbia.edu (Vedat  Dogan)\n#Subject: Re:Addressing.....\n#Message-ID: <1993Apr8.233029.29094@news.columbia.edu>\n\n \n \nn>crap posted by Mr. [(*]!\n \n o boy!   \n \n Please, can you tell us why those quotes are "crap"?..because you do not \n like them!!!...because they really exist...why?\n \n As I said in my previous posting, those quotes exactly exist in the source \n given by Serdar Argic .. \n  \n You couldn't reject it...\n \n \n Here we go again..\n In the book I have, both the front page and the Author's preface give \n the same year: 1923 and 15 January, 1923, respectively!\n (Anyone can check it at her/his library,if not, I can send you the copies of\n pages, please ask by sct) \n \n \nI really don't care what year it was first published(1923 or 1924)\nWhat I care about is what the book writes about murders, tortures,et..in\nthe given quotes by Serdar Argic, and your denial of these quotes..and your\ngroundless accussations, etc. \n \n[...]\n \n \n I claim I have a book in my hand published in 1923(first publication)\n and it exactly has the same quoted info as the book published\n in 1934(Serdar Argic's Reference) has..You couldn't reject it..but, now you\n are avoiding the real issues by twisting around..\n \n Let's see how you lie!..(from 'non-existing' quotes to re-publication)\n \n First you said there was no such a quote in the given reference..You\n called Serdar Argic a liar!..\n I said to you, NO, MR.Davidian, there exactly existed such a quote...\n (I even gave the call number, page numbers..you could't reject it.)\n \n And now, you are lying again and talking about "modified,re-published book"\n(without any proof :how, when, where, by whom, etc..)..\n (by the way, how is it possible to re-publish the book in 1923 if it was\n  first published in 1924(your claim).I am sure that you have some 'pretty \n  well suited theories', as usual)\n \n And I am ready to send the copies of the necessary pages to anybody who\n wants to compare the fact and Mr.Davidian's lies...I also give the call number\n and page numbers again for the library use, which are:  \n                 949.6 R 198\n   \n  and the page numbers to verify the quotes:218 and 215\n              \n     \n \n \n Now, are you claiming that there can't be such a reference by saying "it is\n not possible..." ..If not, what is your point?\n \n Differences in the number of pages?\n Mine was published in 1923..Serdar Argic's was in 1934..\n No need to use the same book size and the same letter \n charachter in both publications,etc, etc.. does it give you an idea!!\n \n The issue was not the number of pages the book has..or the year\n first published.. \n And you tried to hide the whole point..\n the point is that both books have the exactly the same quotes about\n how moslems are killed, tortured,etc by Armenians..and those quotes given \n by Serdar Argic exist!! \n It was the issue, wasn't-it?  \n \n you were not able to object it...Does it bother you anyway? \n \n You name all these tortures and murders (by Armenians) as a "crap"..\n People who think like you are among the main reasons why the World still\n has so many "craps" in the 1993. \n \n Any question?\n \nSerdar Argic
Many of you ask me whether I approve of severe human rights\nviolations by Arab States becuse I focus on Israeli human rights\nviolations.\n\nLet's make things clear: My opposition to H.R. violations in Arab\nStates is total and without qualification. No Arab State is and can\nclaim to be democratic. No Arab state claims to be democratic.\n\nI am born in Palestine (now Israel). I have family there. The lack of\npeace and utter injustice in my home country has affected me all my life.\nI am concerned by Palestine (Israel) because I want peace to come to\nit. Peace AND justice. \n\nIf anybody has legitimate claims towards Arab states, he should present\nhis claims and ask for support. Jews who left Arab states are fully \nentitled to make claims and should do so, if they consider their case has\na merit. It is their basic right to return to these countries, if they\nwish. If not, they should not complain and compare themselves to the\nPalestinians who have been struggling for the right of return since\nIsrael was established and whose right is upheld by the United Nations\nquasi totally. If Jews feel discriminated in Arab countries, they have a\nlegitimate claim that any decent person can and should support. \n\nHuman rights violations by Arab States don't justify, legitimate nor\nare the cause for Israeli breaches of international law and human rioghts.\nIsraeli breaches stem from the Zionist concept, which can only be\nimplemented by negating basic rights to Palestinians. \n\nIsraeli trights and Palestinian rights are not symmetrical. The first\nparty has a state and the other has none. The first is an occupier and\nthe second the occupied. For any meaningful relationship to emerge, some\nsymmetry must be established. As long as Israelis and Jews don't realise\nthe necessity of a change of perspective towards the Palestinian people\nand as long as Israelis and Jews don't want to exorcise their own\npast towards the Palestinians (the Naqba of 1948, etc.) and refuse to\nacknowledge that the creation of Israel was dependent upon the removal\nof most Palestinian Arabs, there will be no base for a real trust.\n\nWhen I read the first time the list of the 383 Arab villages\ndestroyed by the State of Israel in and after 1948, I got a shock. \nI hope others will be touched by this discovery and think about the\nmeaning of such massive destruction and destitution.
This is the latest from UPI \n\n     Foreign Ministry spokesman Ferhat Ataman told journalists Turkey was\n     closing its air space to all flights to and from Armenia and would\n     prevent humanitarian aid from reaching the republic overland across\n     Turkish territory.\n\n  \n   Historically even the most uncivilized of peoples have exhibited \n   signs of compassion by allowing humanitarian aid to reach civilian\n   populations. Even the Nazis did this much.\n\n   It seems as though from now on Turkey will publicly pronounce \n   themselves 'hypocrites' should they choose to continue their\n   condemnation of the Serbians.\n\n\n\n--
I didnot know that "Master of wisdom" can be "name clling" too,\nunless you consider yourself deserve-less !\n\n\nThat was only to confuse you! (ha ha ha hey )\n\n	       ^^^^^^^ are you trying to retaliate and confuse me here.\n\n\nFirst, my above statement doesnot say that "the existence of israeli citizens\nin the WB revoke their right of life" but it says "the israeli occupation\nof the WB revoke the right of life for some/most its citizens - basically\nrevokes the right of for its military men". Clearly, occupation is an\nundeclared war; during war, attacks against military targets are fully legitimate. \n\nSecondly, surely israeli have human rights, but they ask their goverment to\nprotect it by withdrawing from the occupied terretories, not by further oppressing\nPalestinean human rights.\n\n\n\n\nBecause not all states are like Israel, as oppressive, as ignorant, or as tyrant.\n\n\n   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nSo you agree that that an israeli solution wouldnot preserve human rights.\n(i am understanding this from your first statement in this paragraph).\n\n\nExactly, you are right. I guess that the problem is that the israeli goverment \nis full with  men like Joseph Weitz. \n\n\n\nAbove you wrote that you understood what i meant (underlined by ^ ): \nany system can be used to solve the conflict , but not any system would \nresolve it JUSTLY.\n\n\nYou are proving yourself as a " ". First you understood what i meant, but then\nyou claim you didnot so to claim a contradiction in my logic. Too bad for you, \nthe Master of Wisdom.\n\n\n\nWhy do you feel ashamed by things and facts that you believe in , if you were a\nZionists. If you believe in Zionist codes and acts, well i feel sorry for you,\nbecause the same Rabbi Shoham had said "Yes, Zionism is racism".\nIf you feel ashamed and bothered by the Zionist codes, then drop Zionism.\nIf you are not Zionist, why are you bothered then. You should join me in\ncondemning these racist Zionist codes and acts.\n\nHasan
There is no known writing directly attributable to Menachem Begin\nwhich admits a massacre at Deir Yassin.  Thus, Hasan is wrong.\n\n\nThe word "troops" is unjustified.  There has never been any evidence\nthat there were any regular or irregular Arab forces in the village\napart from the villagers defending themselves.  According to the\nHaganah observer Pa'il, the Irgun/Lehi forces suffered a lot of\ncasualties because they were incompetent soldiers.  When they ran\ninto trouble securing the central part of the village, a small group \nof Palmach soldiers came and took it without a single casualty.\nBegin's failure to even mention the Palmach is only one of the\nmajor inaccuracies (to use a kind word) in his account.\n\nIncidentally, "three times as heavy" may be correct, as there is\nserious evidence that the Arab loss was closer to 120 lives than\nto the oft-quoted 250 lives.  However, note that Begin compares\nwounded Jews to dead Arabs.  He fails to mention the number of\nwounded Arabs.  Guess why.\n\n\nAs is thoroughly established by many sources, the loudspeaker truck\ngot stuck in a ditch too far from the village for it to provide a\nusueful warning.\n\n\nIt is worth noting how Begin disputes the standard myth that the\nPalestinian Arabs fled as part of a calculated plan.\n\n\nApparently 90% of Israeli historians are Jew-haters.\n\n\nI have previously posted quotations by Irgun participants that\ntotally destroys Begin's whitewash.  I have no particular desire\nto post it yet again.

Although I realize that principle is not one of your strongest\npoints, I would still like to know why do do not ask any question\nof this sort about the Arab countries.\n\n   If you want to continue this think tank charade of yours, your\nfixation on Israel must stop.  You might have to start asking the\nsame sort of questions of Arab countries as well.  You realize it\nwould not work, as the Arab countries' treatment of Jews over the\nlast several decades is so bad that your fixation on Israel would\nbegin to look like the biased attack that it is.\n\n   Everyone in this group recognizes that your stupid 'Center for\nPolicy Research' is nothing more than a fancy name for some bigot\nwho hates Israel.

Done. But did it change the fact that during the period of 1914 to 1920, \nthe Armenian Government ordered, incited, assisted and participated \nin the genocide of 2.5 million Muslim people because of race, religion\nand national origin? By the way, you still haven't corrected yourself.\nDuring World War II Armenians were carried away with the German might and\ncringing and fawning over the Nazis. In that zeal, the Armenian publication\nin Germany, Hairenik, carried statements as follows:[1]\n\n"Sometimes it is difficult to eradicate these poisonous elements (the Jews)\n when they have struck deep root like a chronic disease, and when it \n becomes necessary for a people (the Nazis) to eradicate them in an uncommon\n method, these attempts are regarded as revolutionary. During the surgical\n operation, the flow of blood is a natural thing." \n\nNow for a brief view of the Armenian genocide of the Muslims and Jews -\nextracts from a letter dated December 11, 1983, published in the San\nFrancisco Chronicle, as an answer to a letter that had been published\nin the same journal under the signature of one B. Amarian.\n\n "...We have first hand information and evidence of Armenian atrocities\n  against our people (Jews)...Members of our family witnessed the \n  murder of 148 members of our family near Erzurum, Turkey, by Armenian \n  neighbors, bent on destroying anything and anybody remotely Jewish \n  and/or Muslim. Armenians should look to their own history and see \n  the havoc they and their ancestors perpetrated upon their neighbors...\n  Armenians were in league with Hitler in the last war, on his premise \n  to grant them self government if, in return, the Armenians would \n  help exterminate Jews...Armenians were also hearty proponents of\n  the anti-Semitic acts in league with the Russian Communists.

[snip]\n   In the first place the death of three soldiers on a patrol in occupied\n   Lebanese terrritory is NOT an act of terrorism or murder.  It is \n   disingeneous to compare their death to that of athletes in Munich\n   or any other act of terrorism or mrder.  This exercise is aimed \n   solely at diverting the issue and is far from the truth.\n\nI agree that the death of three soldiers on a patrol etc... is\nnot terrorism.  That having been said, lets continue.\n\n   [snip]\n   imagine ????  It is NOT a "terrorist camp" as you and the Israelis like \n   to view the villages they are small communities with kids playing soccer\n   in the streets, women preparing lunch, men playing cards, etc.....\n\nI would not argue that all or even most of the villages are "terrorist\ncamps".  There are however some which come very close to serving that\npurpose and that is not to say that other did not function in that way\nprior to the invasion. \n\n   SOME young men, usually aged between 17 to 30 years are members of\n   the Lebanese resistance.  Even the inhabitants of the village do not \n   know who these are, they are secretive about it, but most people often\n   suspect who they are and what they are up to.  These young men are\n   supported financially by Iran most of the time.  They sneak arms and\n   ammunitions into the occupied zone where they set up booby traps\n   for Israeli patrols.  Every time an Israeli soldier is killed or injured\n   by these traps, Israel retalliates by indiscriminately bombing villages\n   of their own choosing often killing only innocent civilians.  Once they\n   are back they announce that they bombed a "terrorist  hideout" where\n   an 8 year old girl just happened to be.\n\nSome of the villages, and yours might well be among them, are as you\ndescribe.  Not all are.  There are a large number of groups in the area,\nbacked by various organizations, with a wide range of purposes.  Hizbollah\nand Amal were two of the larger ones and may still be.  As to retaliation,\nwhile mistakes may be made, that is still a far cry from indiscriminate\nbombing, which would have produced major casualties.\n\n   Israel's retalliation policy is cold hearted, but a reality that\n   we have come to accept and deal with, the Lebanese Resistance\n   on the other hand is not going to stop its attacks on OCCUPYING \n   ISRAELI SOLDIERS until they withdraw, this is the only real \n   leverage that they have to force Israel to withdraw.\n\nWell, here we disagree.  I think that Israel would willingly withdraw if\nthe Lebanese gov't was able to field a reliable force in the area to police\nit and prevent further attacks.\n\n   This is the only realistic solution, it is time for Israel to\n   realize that the concept of a "buffer zone" aimed at protecting\n   its northern cities has failed.  In fact it has caused much more\n   Israeli deaths than the occasional shelling of Northern Israel\n   would have resulted in.  \n\nActually that is not clear at all.  I will agree that the death toll is no\nlonger civilian and now primarily military though.\n\n   There seems to be very little incentive for the Syrian and Lebanese\n   goovernment to allow Hizbollah to bomb Israel proper under such \n   circumstances, and now the Lebanese government has proven that it is\n   capable of controlling and disarming all militias as they did\n   in all other parts of Lebanon.\n\nNo, the Syrian gov't is more than happy to have Israel sink into another\nLebanese morass.  I could elaborate if necessary.\n\n   I agree, only in the case of the Isareli soldiers their killing\n   CANNOT be qualified as murder, no matter what you say.\n\nNo, but it is regretable, as is the whole situation.

04/16/93 1045  ARMENIA SAYS IT COULD SHOOT DOWN TURKISH PLANES\n\nBy David Ljunggren\n\nMOSCOW, April 16, Reuter - Armenia accused Turkey on Friday of flying weapons\nx and troops across Armenian airspace to Azerbaijan and strongly hinted it\nmight try to shoot the planes down, local journalists in Yerevan said.\n\nSeparately, Itar-Tass news agency said Armenian forces had halted their latest\noffensive which has swallowed up one-tenth of Azerbaijan and sent tensions in\nthe Transcaucasian region soaring.\n\nThe journalists in the Armenian capital quoted Armen Duliyan, head of the\nArmenian defence ministry press centre, as saying Ankara had been sending \nplanes up to 15 times a day to Azerbaijan with arms and troops.\n\nIt looks as though the Armenian leadership will have to warn Turkey about\nthe impermissibility of such actions," the journalists quoted Duliyan as \nsaying.\n\n"If such steps are pursued in the future we will have recourse to appropriate\nmeasures. We have all the necessary means, including modern anti-aircraft\nunits."\n\nTurkey, which shares a border with Armenia, has supported Azerbaijan in the\nconflict over the mainly Armenian-populated Nagorno-Karabakh region in which\nmore than 2,500 people have been killed since fighting erupted in 1988.\n\nThe Turkish foreign ministry said on Friday it had so far sent one plane to\nAzerbaijan containing humanitarian aid.\n\nA Turkish foreign ministry spokesman on Thursday would not comment directly\non a report by Hurriyet newspaper that a first consignment of rockets, rocket\nlaunchers, ammunition and light weapons had arrived in Azerbaijan from Turkey.\n\nDuliyan said Turkey had been sending up to 30 trucks a day carrying troops\nand arms to the bordering Azeri autonomous territory of Nakhichevan, from where\nthey were flown across Armenian airspace to the Azeri capital Baku.\n\n"All the responsibility for possible consequences will be borne by the\ncountry which is affording military assistance over our airspace," he said.\n\nArmenia denies any formal role in the conflict, saying that the troops \ninvolved in the fighting are from the enclave itself.\n\nTass said the Karabakh forces decided on Friday to suspend their offensive\nalong the entire Armenian-Azerbaijani front.\n\n"The Karabakh authorities are reportedly ready to give independent\ninspectors a chance to see for themselves on the spot that the (enclave's)\nleadership is striving to achieve a ceasefire," the agency said.\n\nArmenian President Levon Ter-Petrosyan called for a two-stage ceasefire in\nKarabakh when he arrived in the Belarus capital Minsk on Friday for a summit of\nCommonwealth leaders.\n\n"The first stage of the settlement should involve a ceasefire and securing the\nprotection of the Karabakh population," Tass quoted him as saying.\n     \nAt least 10 ceasefires have been brokered in the conflict but all have\ncollapsed.\n\n"The second stage should involve discussing and finding a solution to the\nlegal issues: that is, a clarification of the status of Nagorno-Karabakh," he\nsaid. The republic declared full independence last year but the move has not \nbeen recognised by any other country.\n\nArmenia insists that a separate Karabakh delegation should take part in future\npeace talks, something Azerbaijan rejects.\n\nLocal news agencies in Baku said on Friday that Interior Minister Iskender\nGamidov, a fiery nationalist and hardliner in the territorial dispute with\nArmenia, had resigned.\n\nTuran news agency said he quit on Thursday and had cleared his office.\nKhabar-Servis agency said he would be replaced by the military commandant of\nBaku, police Major-General Abdullah Allakhverdiyev. There was no official\nconfirmation.
The fact that Israel is already discussing with some Palestinians what the composition\nof the armed Palestinian Police Force in the territories will be during the transition\nphase indicates some real solid concessions and liberal thinking on the part of the\nIsraeli side.
The Litani river flows in a west-southwestern direction and indeed does\nnot run through the buffer zone.  The Hasbani does flow into the Jordan\nbut contrary to what our imaginative poster might write, there has been\nno increase in the inflow from this river that is not proportional to\nclimatic changes in rainfall.
I recently read that during Bill Clinton's campaign, he stated\nthat if elected he would immediately recognize Jerusalem as\nIsrael's capital.  According to the article, Mr. Clinton\nreaffirmed this after winning the presidency.  However,\nduring recent talks with President Mubarak, Secretary of\nState Christopher stated that "the status of Jerusalem\nwill be a final matter of discussion between the parties".\n\nNow I don't want to start a big discussion over the status\nof Jerusalem.  All I want to know is if anyone can \nauthenticate Mr. Clinton's statements with dates, places, etc.\n\nThank you.
The latest Israeli "proposal", first proposed in February of 1992, contains \nthe following assumptions concerning the nature of any "interim status" \nrefering to the WB and Gaza, the Palestinians, implemented by negotiations.\nIt states that:    \n   >Israel will remain the existing source of authority until "final status"\n    is agreed upon;\n   >Israel will negiotiate the delegation of power to the organs of the \n    Interim Self-Government Arrangements (ISGA);\n   >The ISGA will apply to the "Palestinian inhabitants of the territories"\n    under Israeli military administration. The arrangements will not have a \n    territorial application, nor will they apply to the Israeli population \n    of the territories or to the Palestinian inhabitants of Jerusalem;\n   >Residual powers not delegated under the ISGA will be reserved by Israel;\n   >Israelis will continue to live and settle in the territoriesd;\n   >Israel alone will have responsibility for security in all its aspects-\n    external, internal- and for the maintenance of public order;\n   >The organs of the ISGA will be of an administrative-functional nature;\n   >The exercise of powers under the ISGA will be subject to cooperation and \n    coordination with Israel. \n   >Israel will negotiate delegation of powers and responsibilities in the \n    areas of administration, justice, personnel, agriculture, education,\n    business, tourism, labor and social welfare, local police,\n    local transportation and communications, municipal affairs and religious\n    affairs.\n\nSeveral question do come to mind concerning the "success" we all hope for \nin the ongoing negotiation process. These arrangements certainly seem to \nbe essentially a rejection of any Palestinian "interim" self-control. \nWithout exposing itself to unwarranted risks and creating irresversible \nvulnerability, can Israel reasonably put forward (at later points in the \nnegotiating process) more "relaxed" proposals for this"interim" period? \nHow should proposals (from either side) be altered to temper their \n"maximalist" approaches as stated above? How can Israeli worries ,and \ndesire for some "interim control", be addressed while providing for a  \nvery *real* interim Palestinian self-governing entity?\n\nTim
There certainly are muslims who *do not* believe that their dream of \na global Islamic community should be achieved through force. There are, \nhowever, others (and, they are often far more visible/vocal than the \nformer) who *do* accept the establishment of global Islam through force. \nI  would *not* feel threatened by those only accepting or pursuing \n"Islamicization" through peaceful means, nor by Jews advocating the same\napproach. Those advocating force as a means of expanding their side's\npower are certainly a threat.\n\nTo Palestinians, Israel is doing just that; maintaining its dominance\nof those *outside* its own "group". If I am told that "I am not one of\nyou" but you then impose your control on me, damn right you are a threat.\nIf I am a member of a non-muslim minority *inside* the Islamic\nworld and *actively did not* accept my "minority" status, I *would also \ncertainly* see Islam's domination as having been acheived, and maintained, \nthrough the powerful coercive force all majorities wield over minorities\nwithin their ranks.\n\nI am not a zionist, but do feel that *both* Jewish and Palestinian\nnationalist desires need, at this juncture, to be accepted in some way.\nFor the same reason that some muslims believe it is proper and righteous\nfor Islam to be spread by force upon those who DO NOT WANT THAT. \n\n\n[I refer to the "most" you also refer to] \nBecause they are scared, and feel very threatened, as well feeling that \nthis area *is* to some degree part of their belief/religion/heritage/\nidentity/etc.
Your suggestion to learn something about "the perversion of Judaism"\nfrom someone you claim has experience in Israeli intelligence and the\nPLO is like a suggestion to learn something about the conspiracy of\nSesame Street from someone with experience in fashion design and\npizza-making. \n\n\n"Judeo-Nazism"?  CPR, you're in a league with Barf Shmidling himself.\nYou can take that as a compliment, if you see it that way.
In his neverending effort to make sure that we do not forget         \n     what a moron he is, Brad Hernlem has asked why Israel rarely\n     abides by UN Security Council resolutions.

With regards to my condemnation of Marc's ridiculous attacks on the\nAmerican Department of Justice, and further attacks on Jews, to\nanyone who took offense to my calling Marc stupid, I\napologize for pointing out the obvious.  It was a waste of the\nNet's time.  I hope, though, that most American citizens have\nthe basic knowlege of the structure of American government to\nunderstand the relationship between the Justice Department\nas a part of the Executive Branch, and the Courts, which\nare of the Judicial Branch.  \nMarc's ignorance of basic civic knowlege underscores his\ninability to comprehend and interpret foreign affairs.
And some of us call them murderous bastards, but what's in a name.\n\n\nJust a damn minute! What history books did you read? I seem to recall\nthat there were a few British, Canadian, American, and Commonwealth\nsoldiers in France about that time. Perhaps you believe they were taking\na vacation trip?\n\n\nSure, the Lebanese want to get all foreigners out of the country so they\ncan go back to killing each other off.\n\n\n\nREB
Elias' initial statement certain *is* hot air. But it seems to be\nalmost standard procedure around here to first throw out an absurb,\noverstated image in order to add extra "meaning" to the posting's\n*real point*. \n\nHowever, his second statement *is* quite real. The essential sealing off\nof Gaza residents from the possibility of making a living *has happened*.\nCertainly, the Israeli had a legitimate worry behind the action they took,\nbut isn't that action a little draconian?
Not acceptable. Syria and Lebanon have a right to determine if\nthey wish to return to the situation prior to the French invasion\nwhere they were both part of the same "mandate territory" - read\ncolony.\n\nIsrael has no right to determine what happens in Lebanon. Invading another\ncountry because you consider them a threat is precisely the way that almost\nall wars of aggression have started.\n\n\n\nAgain territorial expansion by force.\n\n\n\nThe UN defines them as occupied. They are recognised as such by every\nnation on earth (excluding one small caribean island).\n\n\n\nSo the Adam thinks that peace is possible with continued occupation and \na continued military presence? That is a completely unsustainable situation\nbecause the USA is bankrupt and simply cannot afford to finance the\nIsraeli ecconomy any more. There is no money for such an occupation.\n\n\n\nThey were moved in as part of a deliberate policy to prevent the return\nof the occupied territories. Machiavelli described the reasoning in the\nPrince. The clear intention was to create a constituency which the Likud\nbeleived could not be deprived of the land stolen from the indigenous\npopulation.\n\nThe pretexts under which the settlers aquired land was through the \nredefinition of much land used in common as "public land". The assertion\nthat the village common on which the village depends for food belongs to\nan invader simply because no individual has title is clearly an\nexcuse. When the land is used to build a condominium for aliens brought\nin to occupy the land for a foreign power there is a clear breach of the\nGeneva convention which stipulates that land use in occupied territories\nmust not be changed. \n\nNo amount of self justifying on the part of Likud and hard linner appologists\nwill change the fact that the majority of world governments, and all of\nthose that actually have any power have condemned this practice.\n\n\n\nTheyu also are a liability. We are talking about civilian encampments that\nwould last no more than hours against tanks,\n\n\nDon't fool yourself. It was the gulf war that brought the Israelis to the\nnegotiating table. Once their US backers had a secure base in the gulf\nthey insrtructed Shamir to negotiate or else.\n\nIf the creation of settlements had gone on any longer the USA would have\ncut the money supply.\n\n\nNot at all. They can chose to live in an arab state or return to Israel.\n\n\nThe existence of a comunity does not give the right for another country\nto annexe territory, not in Bosnia, not in the West Bank.\n\n\nUnless the new boundaries drawn up are those of 48 there will be no peace.\nAraffat has precious little authority to agree to anything else.\n\n\nThe real issue is not the land treaty but the trade treaty. Since the\nPalestinians will remain heavily dependent on Israel indefinitely it\nis this that will be the guarantor of peace. another factor will be the\nreturn of lands confiscated by the Israeli state within Israel and the\ndismantling of the shadow structures which allow discrimination against\nnon-Jews within what is nominaly a secular state. \n\nThe irony is that in return for a guarantee that the palestinian state has\na non descrimination law in order to protect the remaining settlers the\nIsraeli state is going to be forced inot the same position. This will mean\noutlawing of discrimination such as that which prevents arabs from buying\nor using much of the land.
If "ownership" were rightly based on "worthiness" there wouldn't be any owners.\nWhat is your point?\n\nAs I understand it, Israel's "claim" on Jerusalem is based on 1) possession,\nand 2) the absolutely CENTRAL (not second, not third) role it plays in jewish \nidentity.
Anas Omran has claimed that, "the Israelis used to arrest, and\nsometime to kill some of these neutral reporters."  The assertion\nby Anas Omran is, of course, a total fabrication.  If there is an\nonce of truth iin it, I'm sure Anas Omran can document such a sad\nand despicable event.  Otherwise we may assume that it is another\npiece of anti-Israel bullshit posted by someone whose family does\nnot know how to teach their children to tell the truth.  If Omran\nwould care to retract this 'error' I would be glad to retract the\naccusation that he is a liar.  If he can document such a claim, I\nwould again be glad to apologize for calling him a liar.  Failing\nto do either of these would certainly show what a liar he is.
Would it be asking too much for you to DOCUMENT these allegations of\n"Israel used to arrest and kill neutral reporters"? I think you confuse\nIsrael with other nations of that geographical region to which the notion\nof a free, unmonitored by the government, press corps would be a joke.
I did say *any* invader, didn't I?  What do you want from me, perhaps a neural\nnet design with all countries involved in Lebanon as its nodes? :-)  (You are\nin Cognitive and Neural Systems)

From: Center for Policy Research <cpr>\nSubject: Zionism - racism\n\n\nDiaspora 'a cancer'\n------------------- by Julian Kossoff and Lindsay Schusman in:\nJewish Chronicle, London, 22. Dec. 1989\n\nLeading Israeli author and cultural commentator, A.B. Yehoshua,\nlaunched a ferocious attack on diaspora Jewry at a Zionist Youth\nCouncil meeting in North London, last week.\n\nThe diaspora, he claimed, "was the cancer connected to the main\ntissue of the Jewish people". He was scathing about its failure to\nact before the Holocaust.\n\nHe said the diaspora's religious and secular leadership had\nignored the warning signs in the 1920s, and had fiercely opposed\nZionism. Consequently, he considered the Holocaust, "the failure\nof Judaism".\n\nHis talk, entitled "Diaspora: A Neurotic Solution", covered 5,000\nyears of Jewish history.\n\nMr. Yehoshua's other targets included Soviet Jews who were, he\nsaid "not staying [in Israel], but running [away]", and all Jews\noutside Israel "who were using other people's countries like\nhotels".\n\nThe only conclusion he could draw was that the diaspora was\nimmoral, because it looked to Israel for its identity but lived\nelsewhere.\n\nWorse, it threatened Israel itself, creating a distraction for her\ncitizens, who were leaving by the thousands.\n\nMr. Yehoshua, who described himself as "a soldier for aliyah",\nended by calling for the creation of a new "total Jew", living in\nIsrael.\n\nEarlier, speaking at a meeting of Jewish students on the\ndifficulties of forging a national identity in Israeli literature,\nMr. Yehoshua claimed that Israeli writers were paralyzed by the\ncountry's political situation.\n\nHe said Israel's wars had once provided writers with a vital\nsource of inspiration.  Today, Israeli writers avoided writing\ndirectly about the Arab-Israeli conflict. No major work had been\nproduced about the intifada.\n\nInstead, writers were tackling themes such as Jewish identity,\nemigration from Israel and personal and family issues.\n\nMr. Yehoshua admitted he also felt unable to write about the\nIsraeli political situation. He could no longer step into an\nIsraeli Arab's shoes and portray him as a real "flesh and blood\ncharacter".\n\nHe claimed that after 40 years of statehood, the problem of\nIsraeli identity had not been solved. He said Jews remained too\npre-occupied with the borders of identity between Jew and non-Jew,\nand were not concerned with the nature of that identity.\n\nJewish values in Israel embraced every aspect of daily life,\nunlike in the diaspora, where Jews had no responsibility for the\ncountry they lived in, he said.\n\nHe warned that modern Hebrew, a unifying force for the Jewish\npeople, would have to struggle for its future, especially in\nliterary circles. It faced fierce competition from the English\nlanguage.
From: Center for Policy Research <cpr>\nSubject: Gaza and separation from Israel\n\n\nGaza and the idea of separation\n\nThe Israeli Left's inability to cope with the challenges it is\npresented with by reality becomes obvious at those moments when\nthe reality does not line up with the expectations of the left. We\nwere able to see this clearly during the Gulf War.  Because of the\nPalestinian's popular solidarity with Iraq, Yossi Sarid -\ncurrently Minister of the Environment - made his infamous\nstatement: "You look for me !", i.e., I'am not making any more\nefforts to speak with you. From Yossi Sarid's point of view,\nPalestinian reality during the Gulf War was not the lengthy curfew\nor the danger of hunger it brought with it, but whether or not the\nPalestinians accepted what was acceptable to the party. Similarly\nMERETZ, MK Deddi Tzuker, recently faced with criticism from\nresidents of the West Bank town of Beit Sahour over his\ngovernment's and his party's lack of action for human rights and\npeace, responded by asking those present at the discussion whether\nthey would rather have a Likud government. From the Leftists'\nperspective this is the best government because it is THEIR\ngovernment, regardless of what it does.\n\nThese members of the Israeli Left have already decided how the\nfuture of the Occupied Territories will look, and they want to\ndictate to the Palestinians how to get there. An essential step\ntowards this future is their participation in Yitzhak Rabin's\ngovernment, and from their point of view the expulsions were a\nmarginal byproduct of this "government of peace", which need not\ndisturb the routine course of events. Likewise the "Rabinic"\npolicies in Gaza - the blowing up of houses with anti-tank rockets\nand the significant increases in the number of persons injured in\nthe suppression of demonstrations - need not disturb it.\n\nBut the fact that reality is not as they would have it forces\nitself upon them when a mob in Gaza falls upon a settler who has\nlost his way, when a settler is stabbed by his Palestinian\nworkers, or when a Palestinian knifes people in the streets of Tel\nAviv. Then all hell breaks loose and the Israeli Left has nothing\nto propose except separation: Let's cut ourselves off from the\nPalestinians, let's build a fence so high that they won't be able\nto harm us - this is the cry of the Israeli Left. Let us erect a\nfence between us and the reality whith is the occupation.\n\nMeron Benvenisti writes about this in Ha'aretz (4-3-93): "...The\nliberal Left. which does not differentiate between physical\nseparation and 'the future of the territories', must come to\nunderstand that the regime of magnetic cards, exclusion of Arab\nworkers, closure, and curfew are instruments of enforcement\ndesigned for the suppression of a population in revolt, and that\ntheir ideological support for separation only provides\n'humanitarian' arguments for the legitimization of the <status\nquo>.\n\nEnforced separation is carried out only to meet the need of the\nruling community, but it is only the ruled population which bears\nits burden. [.....].\n\n"Whoover thinks that 'out of Gaza first' is a liberal,\nhumanitarian idea had best contemplate the question of whether\nthis position is also moral. It is very easy to shake off\nresponsibility for this concentration of human suffering, and to\nthus also disregard responsibility for it's creation. It is very\neasy to erect a fence between Jewish and Arab neighborhoods in\nJerusalem, when this fence has a gate - the keys to which are at\nthe disposal of one hand - which opens to allow the Jews to pursue\nall their interests, but is barred to the Arabs...".
Why retract your accusation that he's a liar?  If Omran retracts his "verbal\ndiarrohea" doesn't that only prove the liar he *really* is?  A retraction\nwould be pointless!  Giving this guy the opportunity to "save face" after\nuttering such bullshit would just encourage him to do it again!  I must say\nthat your style is very impressive, Mark.  Keep it up!\n\n- Mike
April 13, 1993 response by Al Moore (L629159@LMSC5.IS.LMSC.LOCKHEED.COM):\n\nBasically the problem is that Israel may remain, or leave, the occupied \nterritories; it cannot do both, it cannot do neither. So far, Israe \ncontinues to propose that they remain. The Palestinians propose that they \nleave. Why should either change their view? It is worth pointing out that \nthe only area of compromise accomodating both views seems to require a\nreduction in the Israeli presence. Israel proposes no such reduction....\nand in fact may be said to *not* be negotiating.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTim: \n\nThere seem to be two perceptions that **have to be addressed**. The\nfirst is that of Israel, where there is little trust for Arab groups, so\nthere is little support for Israel giving up **tangible** assets in \nexchange for pieces of paper, "expectations", "hopes", etc. The second\nis that of the Arab world/Palestinians, where there is the demand that\nthese "tangible concessions" be made by Israel **without** it receiving\nanything **tangible** back.  Given this, the gap between the two stances\nseems to be the need by Israel of receiving some ***tangible*** returns\nfor its expected concessions. By "tangible" is meant something that\n1) provides Israel with "comparable" protection (from the land it is to \ngive up), 2) in some way ensures that the Arab states and Palestine \n**will be** accountable and held actively (not just "diplomatically) \nresponsible for the upholding of all actions on its territory (by citizens \nor "visitors").\n\nIn essence I do not believe that Israel objections to Palestinian\nstatehood would be anywhere near as strong as they are now IF Israel\nwas assured that any new Palestinian state *would be committed to** \nco-existing with Israel and held responsible for ALL attacks on Israel \nfrom its territory.\n	Aside from some of the rather slanted proposals above,\n	how *could* such "guarantees" be instilled? For example,\n	how could such "guarantees"/"controls" be added to the\n	Palestinian PISGA proposals?\n\nIsrael is hanging on largely because it is scared stiff that the minute\nit lets go (gives lands back to Arab states, no more "buffer zone", gives\nfull autonomy to Palestinians), ANY and/or ALL of the Arab parties\ncould (and *would*, if not "controlled" somehow) EASILY return to the \ntraditional anti-Israel position. The question then is HOW to *really*\nensure that that will not happen.
Davidian, who are fascists? Armenians in Azerbaijan are killing Azeri \npeople, invading Azeri soil and they are not fascists, because they \nlack food ha? Strange explanation.

TORTURE." ---------- */\nFROM THE ISRAELI PRESS.\n\nNewspaper: Ma'ariv Date: 18. December 1992 Author: Avi Raz\n\nSubject: Torture\n\nTitle of article: Moderate physical pressure\n\nSeveral times in the course of the long hours in the interrogation\nroom in Tulkarm prison, during which he says he was humiliated,\nbeaten and tortured, Omar Daoud Jaber heard his interrogator, a\nShabak agent 'Captain Louis', chatting on the phone with his wife.\n"At those moments", Omar said, "I felt that he was like a\nhumanbeing, but right after he finished talking, he would be beat\nme and say, 'You listened to the conversation and enjoyed\nyourself' and I understood that he was not really a human being".\n\nIn late October 1992, after 38 days in detention at Tulkarm\nprison, Omar Jaber was released without charges. "Among the Jews,\nas among the Arabs, there are good people and bad people", he said\nafter his release, "but there, in Tulkarm, in the interrogations\nrooms, you cannot find even one person about whom you can say that\nhe is a human being". Although he left the detention installation\nin Tulkarm bruised and humiliated ("I sat at home for ten days. My\nhands shook from nerves"), one may consider Omar Jaber lucky: He\ngot out, not so healthy, but entire, and even ultimately returned\nto normal functioning, at the small solar heater plant he owns.\n\nIn contrast, Hassan Bader al-Zbeidi, for example, was released\nseven weeks ago from detention in Tulkarm after 33 days in the\nShabak wing, cut off from his surroundings. He doesn't speak or\nreact. Mustafa Barakat, aged only 23, who was arrested in early\nAugust and was brought to the Tulkarm detention installation, left\nit one day later - dead. "We have recently received an especially\nlarge number of testimonies concerning cruel tortures employed at\nthe Tulkarm detention installation by Shabak interrogators", noted\nDr. Niv Gordon, director of the Association of Israel and\nPalestinian Physicians for Human Rights. (...)\n\nThe right to complain against the Shabak does not excite Anan\nSaber Makhlouf, a 20 year old student. In fact, he was extremely\nfearful about describing the manner in which he was interrogated\nin Tulkarm prison, in case the publication in the paper would\nreturn him to detention and lead to renewed mistreatment.\n\n(...follow description of tortures....)\n\nOmar, a tall bearded man, was silent. "I do not want to talk about\nit", he finally said, quietly. Some time later, embarrased and\nashamed, he spoke: "Sometimes he beats you and beats you until\nyou'll kiss his hand, and not only his hand. Even the hands of\nanother interrogator, and another, whom he calls into the room,\nlater if I want, you will kiss my ass."\n\nThese things take place in an Israeli army detention installation,\nlocated within the military government compound in Tulkarm (West\nBank). But the Shabak interrogation wing is a separate kingdom. In\nearly March the IDF allowed representatives of B'Tselem, the\nIsraeli Information Center for Human Rights in the Territories, to\nvisit Tulkarm prison, but denied them access to the interrogation\nwing. "The interrogation wing is Shabak property, being solely\nunder Shabak responsibility. All interrogations are performed by\nit", said Lieutnant Sharon Sho'an, the commander of the\ninstallation, according to the internal report written by B'tselem\nmember, Yuval Ginbar, following the visit. Major David Pe'er,\ngoverning commander of the prison system in the Central Command,\nwas quoted in the report:  "There is an ethical problem here - no\none can enter the interrogation wing".

It was for the purpose of establishing a state, not an\nexclusive state.  If the state was to be exclusive, it would not have\n400 000 arab citizens.\n\n	And no, I do not consider the purchase of land a hostile\naction.  When someone wants to buy land, and someone else is willing\nto sell it, at a mutually agreeable price, then that is commerce.  It\nis not a hostile action leading to war.\n\n\n	Oh, you mean like both Jews and Arabs being citizens?  The\narabs who stayed are now citizens, with as much right to choose who\nthey vote for as the Jews.\n\n\n	Huh?  The people who left, did so voluntarily.  There is no\nreason for Israel to let them in.\n\n\n	Israel got no western aid in 1948, nor in 1949 or 50...It\nstill granted citizenship to those arabs who remained.  And how\nis granting citizenship a facade?\n\n\n\n	Try again, you tell me what its isn't, but you fail to\nestablish what it is.\n\n	Also, Jews did have history in Israel for over a thousand\nyears.  There were lots of Jews slaughtered by Crusaders in Israel.\nThere was a thriving community in Gaza city from roughly 1200-1500.\nJews were a majority in Jerusalem from 1870 or so onwards.

Do you have a terminal cold? Karabag is 'Turkish' and will remain \n'Turkish'. Here we are, almost at the end of the 20th century, and \na whole community, the Azeri Turks of x-Soviet Armenia and Karabag, \nis facing forced assimilation, torture and murder on one hand and \nforced exodus, expulsion and genocide on the other, all because \nof their ethnic and religious background. And one should ask herself: \nis the world community really so powerless? Where are all those human \nrights advocates? Where are all the decent people? Are we going to \nlet this human tragedy go on and do nothing about it? The number\nof Azeris murdered by the terrorist Armenian army and its savage\ngangs is increasing. On the one hand they wish to distort the truth\nand on the other, they beg mercy from Turkiye.\n\n        The Age...Melbourne...6/3/92\n\n        By Helen WOMACK  .... Agdam, Azerbaijan, Thursday\n\n        The exact number of victims is still unclear,  but there can be \n        little  doubt that Azeri civilians were massacred  by  Armenian \n        fighters in the snowy mountains of Nagorno-Karabakh last week. \n\n        Refugees  from the enclave town of Khojaly,  sheltering in  the \n        Azeri border town of Agdam, give largely consistent accounts of \n        how  their  enemies  attacked their homes on the  night  of  25 \n        February,    chased  those  who  fled  and  shot  them  in  the \n        surrounding forests. Yesterday, I saw 75  freshly dug graves in \n        one  cemetery  in  addition to four mutilated corpses  we  were \n        shown in the mosque when we arrived in Agdam late on Tuesday. I \n        also  saw women and children with bullet wounds in a  makeshift \n        hospital in a string of railway carriages. \n\n        Khojaly, an Azeri settlement in the enclave mostly populated by \n        Armenians,  had a population of about 6000. Mr.  Rashid Mamedov \n        Commander of Police in Agdam,  said  only about 500  escaped to \n        his  town.   " So where are the rest?".  Some might have  taken \n        prisoner, he said, or fled. Many bodies were still lying in the \n        mountains  because  the  Azeris were short  of  helicopters  to \n        retrieve them. He believed more than 1000 had perished, some of \n        cold in temperatures as low as minus 10 degrees. \n\n        One  refugee,  Rami Nasiru,  described how Khojaly residents at \n        first thought the attack was no more than the routine  shooting \n        to  which they had become accustomed in four years of conflict. \n        But  when  they  saw the Armenians with  a  convoy  of  armored \n        personnel carriers, they realised they could not hope to defend \n        themselves  with  machineguns and grenades,  and fled into  the \n        forests. In the small hours, the massacre started. \n\n        Mr.  Nasiru,  who believes his wife and two children were taken \n        prisoner,   repeated what many other refugees have said -  that \n        troops of the former Soviet army helped the Armenians to attack \n        Khojaly. "It is not my opinion, I saw it with my own eyes." \n\n\nSerdar Argic

C'mon, you still haven't corrected yourself, 'wieneramus'. In April \n1942, Hitler was preparing for the invasion of the Caucasus. A \nnumber of Nazi Armenian leaders began submitting plans to German\nofficials in spring and summer 1942. One of them was Souren Begzadian\nPaikhar, son of a former ambassador of the Armenian Republic in Baku.\nPaikhar wrote a letter to Hitler, asking for German support to his\nArmenian national socialist movement Hossank and suggesting the\ncreation of an Armenian SS formation in order \n\n"to educate the youth of liberated Armenia according to the \n spirit of the Nazi ideas."\n\nHe wanted to unite the Armenians of the already occupied territories\nof the USSR in his movement and with them conquer historic Turkish\nhomeland. Paikhar was confined to serving the Nazis in Goebbels\nPropaganda ministry as a speaker for Armenian- and French-language\nradio broadcastings.[1] The Armenian-language broadcastings were\nproduced by yet another Nazi Armenian Viguen Chanth.[2]\n\n[1] Patrick von zur Muhlen (Muehlen), p. 106.\n[2] Enno Meyer, A. J. Berkian, 'Zwischen Rhein und Arax, 900\n    Jahre Deutsch-Armenische beziehungen,' (Heinz Holzberg\n    Verlag-Oldenburg 1988), pp. 124 and 129.\n\n\nThe establishment of Armenian units in the German army was favored\nby General Dro (the Butcher). He played an important role in the\nestablishment of the Armenian 'legions' without assuming any \nofficial position. His views were represented by his men in the\nrespective organs. An interesting meeting took place between Dro\nand Reichsfuehrer-SS Heinrich Himmler toward the end of 1942.\nDro discussed matters of collaboration with Himmler and after\na long conversation, asked if he could visit POW camp close to\nBerlin. Himmler provided Dro with his private car.[1] \n\nA minor problem was that some of the Soviet nationals were not\n'Aryans' but 'subhumans' according to the official Nazi philosophy.\nAs such, they were subject to German racism. However, Armenians\nwere the least threatened and indeed most privileged. In August \n1933, Armenians had been recognized as Aryans by the Bureau of\nRacial Investigation in the Ministry for Domestic Affairs.\n\n[1] Meyer, Berkian, ibid., pp. 112-113.\n\nNeed I go on?\n\nSerdar Argic

They are news because they are the exceptions. And the 'Islamic Holocaust'\nis much the topic of the day. The historical evidence proves that during \nthe period of 1914 to 1920, the Armenian Government ordered, incited, \nassisted and participated in the genocide of 2.5 million Muslim people \nbecause of race, religion and national origin. Armenians perpetrated acts \nof sabotage, destroyed telephone cables, blew up bridges, blocked passes, \nset up ambushes, attacked security stations and small Turkish outposts \nbehind the Ottoman Army lines on the one hand, and on the other ruthlessly \nattacked Turkish and Kurdish villages, slaughtering the Turkish population \nindiscriminately, women, children, old and young alike. Innocent \nMuslims were one by one cruelly bayonetted to death, or massacred with \naxes and swords, or else shut up in mosques or in schools and then burnt\nalive as can be seen below.\n\nWidespread Armenian massacres of innocent Muslims took place in regions \nof Van, Kars, Sivas, Erzurum, Bitlis, Erzincan, Mus, Diyarbakir and \nMaras. The Ottoman Army, while fighting to prevent the Russian invasion,\nalso had to deal with Armenian genocide squads who cowardly hit from \nbehind. The Armenian genocide of the Muslims spread to all parts of \nEastern Anatolia. Starting from late 1914, Armenians committed \nwidespread massacres and genocide in Eastern Anatolia, because the arena\nwas left to the Armenians. Almost every Turkish town and village from \nErzincan up to Azerbaidjan suffered large scale massacres and genocide \nby Armenians and the Turkish genocide has been documented by Armenian, \nRussian, American, British, Ottoman, German, Austrian and French \njournalists and officers who observed the first genocide of this century\ncommitted by the blood-thirsty Armenian genocide squads.\n\nThe Ottoman Army, liberating Trabzon, Bayburt, Erzincan, Erzurum, \nKars and other regions from the Russians, saw that the cities and their \nvillages had been destroyed and burnt, people slaughtered, massacred.\nThe massacres conducted by Armenians, which became a black stain for\nhumanity, shocked and disgusted even the Russian, British, German,\nAustrian, French and American authorities.\n\nAlmost every Ottoman document is related to Armenian massacres and \ncruelties. The inhuman treatment, cruelties, atrocities, genocide by \nArmenian genocide squads perpetrated against innocent Moslem Turkish \nand Kurdish people, are sufficiently reflected in historical documents. \nEven today over seventy-five years later, the terrifying screams of \nthe victims of these cruelties can be heard.\n\n\nSource: Documents: Volume I (1919).\n        "Document No: 76," Archive No: 1/2, Cabin No: 109, Drawer \n        No: 3, File No: 346, Section No: 427(1385), Contents No: 3, 52-53.\n        (To Lt.

All the villages from Trabzon to Erzincan and from\n Erzincan to Erzurum are destroyed. Corpses of Turks brutally and cruelly\n slain are everywhere. According to accounts by those who were able to\n save their lives by escaping to mountains, the first horrible and fearful\n events begun when the Russian forces evacuated the places which were then\n taken over by Armenian gangs. The Russians usually treated the people \n well, but the people feared the intervention of the Armenians. Once these\n places had been taken over by the Armenians, however, the massacres begun.\n They clearly announced their intention of clearing what they called the\n Armenian and Kurdish land from the Turks and thus, solve the nationality\n problem. Today I had the opportunity to meet Austrian and German soldiers\n who had escaped from Russian prison camps and come from Kars and\n Alexander Paul (Gumru-Leninakan)...Russian officers tried to save the \n Turks and there were clashes between Russian officers and Armenian gangs. \n I am now in Erzurum, and what I see is terrible. Almost the whole city is \n destroyed. The smell of the corpses still fills the air. Although there are \n speculations that Armenian gangs murdered Austrian and German prisoners as \n well, I could not get the supporting evidence in this regard, but there is \n proof of murdering of Turkish prisoners of war."\n\n                                                     Dr. Stephan Eshnanie\n\nSerdar Argic

The 27th was a short day at\nwork, we worked until eleven or eleven-thirty and left for home. I decided\nto go for a short walk. I went to Primorsky Park. I walked past the Eternal\nFlame and saw a group of about 8 to 10 people standing there. When I had\nwalked another 15 to 20 yards I heard the screech of automobile brakes\nbehind me. I turned my head toward the sound. It was a light blue GAZ-24\nVolga. I see that the people who were standing there have gone over to the \ncar. A man and a woman get out. The man is expensively dressed, in a suit,\nand the woman has a raincoat on. She doesn't have anything on her head, and \nher hair is let down, sightly reddish hair, a heavy-set woman. They're 40 to \n45 years old. They get something out of the trunk. The people start to help\nthem. I become curious just what are they pulling out of there?\n\nWhen I got up close I heard them turn something on. I didn't see what it was, \nbut it was probably a tape recorder. They put it on the ground near the \nEternal Flame honoring the 26 Baku Commissars and formed a tight circle\naround it. I ask, "What's going on?" Someone tells me, "Come listen." Well\nthey were Azerbaijanis, I had asked in Azerbaijani. I hear appeals: "Brother\nMuslims, our time has come . . . " and something else along that line. I\ndidn't understand what it was all about. I walked around the group trying to \nget a look at the owner of the tape recorder. But the circle drew in tighter. \nNew people started coming from various directions, five here, seven there. And\nthe comments started: "Right, we should slaughter the Armenians!" and "There's\nno need to be afraid, all of Moscow is behind us." I even heard that: "All \nMoscow is behind us." Well I watched and listened in and realized that this \nwas no joke. I quietly left and went home.\n\nNow before that at work I had heard that something was going on in Karabagh, \nthat there were demonstrations there. Well, people were saying all kinds of \nthings, but I didn't have any idea what was really going on.\n\nMy wife and son were at home, but my daughter was at my aunt's house in Baku. \nI didn't say anything to my wife. We sat and drank tea. Sometime around two\no'clock right behind our house suddenly there is noise, whistling, and \nshouting. I looked out the window and saw a crowd. The crowd is moving slowly,\nlike they show on TV when blacks in South Africa are striking or having a \ndemonstration and move slowly.\n\nMy wife asks what's going on out there. I say I don't know. I put on some\noutdoor clothes and went out to find out what it was all about. In the crowd\npeople are shouting "Down with the Armenians!" and "Death to the Armenians!" I\nwaited for the entire crowd to pass. At first they went down Narimanov Street \non the side with the SK club and the City Party Committee; then they turned \nand went against the traffic--it's one way there--down the Street of the 26 \nBaku Commissars toward the streetcar line. I went home and told my wife there \nwas a demonstration going on. In fact I thought that we were having the same \nkind of demonstrations that they had had in Yerevan and in Karabagh. Aside \nfrom the things they were shouting, I was surprised that there were only young\npeople in the crowd. And they were minors, under draft age.\n\nMy wife and son wanted to go upstairs to visit a friend, but I was kind of\nuneasy and said, "No, let's stay at home instead." An hour went by, or maybe \nan hour and a half. Well, I wasn't keeping track of the time, I can't say\nexactly how long it was. I look and see another crowd on Narimanov, but now on\nthe side with the microdistricts, the bazaar, and the Rossiya movie theater.\n\nI put outside clothes on and went out again. There's noise, an uproar outside,\nand the crowd has grown. There are more people. And whereas the first time \nthere were individual shouts, this time they are more focused, more \naggressive. No, I think, something's wrong here, this isn't any demonstration.\nThey would run, stop, then walk quickly and make sharp dashes, and then run \nagain. I was walking along the sidewalk and they were in the street. I \nfollowed them. I was thinking I'd just watch and see. Who knew where this was \nleading? We came out on Lenin Square. At the square the SK club is on one \nside, and the City Party Committee is on the other. I went toward the square \nand heard noise and shouting, as though the whole town had turned out. There \nwas some sort of a rally going on. I go closer and hear exclamations, appeals.\nI heard both anti-Armenian and anti-Soviet appeals. "We don't need \nperestroika, we want to go on living like we have been." Now what did they \nmean by "living like we have been?" The Azerbaijanis work like everyone else. \nBut too many people live at the expense of the government and at the expense \nof others. Speculation, theft, and cheating go on all the time. And not just \nin Azerbaijan, everywhere, in all the republics, but I've never seen it \nanywhere else like I have in Azerbaijan.\n\nNow at this rally someone says that they should go around to the Armenians' \napartments and drive them out, beat them and drive them out. True, I didn't \nhear them say "kill them" over the microphone, I only heard "beat them and \ndrive them out." I stayed at the square a few minutes longer. First one, then\nanother are going up onto the stage, and no one tries to stop the crowd. Off\nto the side of the crowd there were small groups of three or four people, and \nI think they were MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] or State Security KGB.\nThere were also uniformed policemen there, but I didn't see any of them try \nto pacify the crowd. New people kept coming up onto the stage.\n\nWell I had finally decided that this could end badly: This was no\ndemonstration, and I had to protect my family.\n\nI left the Square to return home and suddenly noticed a truck. It was next\nto the City Party Committee, on Narimanov Street, it stood next to the tai-\nlor's shop there, a low truck, and it had low, wooden panels. I see that some-\nthing is being unloaded, crates of some sort. I decided to go look because\nafter all those appeals I was apprehensive and thought there might be weapons\nin there. They pulled the crates out onto the square, not toward the City \nParty Committee, but toward the SK club. And when I went right up to them I \nsaw that they were cases of vodka. There were two people handing down the \ncases from the bed of the truck, and on the ground there were many people, 15 \nto 20. They were handing them down from the truck and each case was carried \noff by two people. Two people, one case of vodka. And there was a man standing\nright next to the truck and he was handing out roundish black lumps, maybe \nabout the size of a fist, maybe a little bigger or smaller. It was anasha. \nWhen I passed next to that person, he stood with his side to me. There was \nabout a yard and a half between us, and two people were standing near him. He \nhas a package in his hand, and he's pulling out anasha and handing it out. I \nhave never smoked it myself. Once I tried it for fun, but I've seen a lot of \npeople smoke it, I've seen it many times, and I know what it is. I strolled \naround and no one asked me who I was or what I was doing there.\n\nBefore I got to the Glass Bazaar I heard more howling, more warlike shouting. \nI turned around and saw them running. Well I'll just keep on going like I am, \nI thought. When they caught up with me I saw that they were carrying flags. \nAnd I recognized the person who was carrying the flag on my side of the \nstreet. He's a young guy, 21 or 22 years old. He was carrying a red flag, \nwhich had "Ermeni oryum" written on it in Azerbaijani, that means "Death to \nArmenians!" That guy used to live off the same courtyard as us. I don't really\nknow what his name is, but I know his father very well. His father's name is\nRafik; he used to be a cook, and then became head chef. He used to have a dark\nblue Zhiguli van, then he sold it and now he has a white Zhiguli 06. His \nfamily, as I said, lived on the same courtyard as we did. Our building was on \nNarimanov Street, and theirs was on the Street of the 26 Baku Commissars; \ntheir apartment was in the far entryway, on the fifth floor, the door on the \nleft. Now Rafik's little brother lives there, and he, Rafik, I heard, got a \nnew apartment either in the forth or eighth microdistrict. In a word, his son \nwas carrying a flag that said "Death to Armenians!" I was surprised because \nbefore this I had gotten the impression that all of this nonsense was being \ndone not by people from Sumgait, but by Azerbaijanis from Agdam and Kafan.\n\nWell anyway I went home. My wife was upset. I told her, "It's OK, it'll pass, \nthey're young kids, they've just gotten all whooped up." Naturally I didn't \nwant her to get overly upset. After a while a new surge of crowd went by. And \nthis time they were breaking glass. I could hear it breaking, but I couldn't \nsee where. Well I think, here we go, the machine's in motion. They weren't \nhanding out that vodka and anasha for nothing. I didn't see people drinking \nand smoking on the spot, but they certainly hadn't unloaded the vodka and \nhashish to put in a store window!\n\nSo the thought flashed through my head that the machine was running, no one \nwould stop them now, they weren't even trying, although, I'll say it again, \nthe police were there, I saw them. And it's not just that the police weren't \nbreaking them up, they were joking with them, they were having a good time. \nTrue, at the time I couldn't even imagine that under our government, our much-\nvaunted leadership--and I'm not afraid to say these words: so many people \ndied, So many women were abused, and how many abominations there were!--I \ncouldn't imagine that under our much-vaunted authorities, and if I were to be \nspecific, I would say under the much-touted authorities in our city of \nSumgait, I couldn't imagine that such things could take place.\n\nWhen they started breaking glass I told my wife and son: "Let's go upstairs." \nWe went to our neighbors, the Grigorians, on the fourth floor. And in the \nevening, when those crowds started going past again, I went outside once more.\nI stopped at "The Corner," a place called that right next to the bazaar. I \nlook and see a crowd on the run. And there, a few yards from the entrance to \nthe bazaar, are three respectable-looking men of around, say, 50 years old. \nThe crowd was running and one of the three waved with his arm and pointed \ntoward the bazaar. And then the whole crowd, as though it were one person, \nwheeled and raced toward the bazaar. And not a soul went past those three, as \nthough it were off limits! Well everything got all churned up, there was more \nnoise, and the glass was flying again.\n\nWe spent the night at the neighbors'. My apartment was on the first floor,\nthere was really no way to defend yourself there.\n\nIn the morning I went out to buy bread and to see what was happening in town. \nOn the way I saw someone hunched up, still. I never found out who it was or \nwhat happened to him. There were 10 to 15 people standing near him. I got the \nbread and on my way back, they had gathered around the person who was lying \nthere hunched up, sort of enclosing him; because of the way they were standing\nyou couldn't even see him.\n\nThat was on the morning of February 28. Everyone knows the rest.\n\n   May 17, 1988\n   Yerevan\n\n		     - - - reference - - -\n\n[1] _The Sumgait Tragedy; Pogroms against Armenians in Soviet Azerbaijan,\n    Volume I, Eyewitness Accounts_, edited by Samuel Shahmuradian, forward by\n    Yelena Bonner, 1990, published by Aristide D.

Come on!  Most if not all Arabs are sympathetic to the Palestinian war \nagainst Israel.  That is why the ADL monitors Arab organizations.  That is\nthe same reason the US monitored communist organizations and Soviet nationals\nonly a few years ago.  \n\n\nAll of these groups have, in the past, associated with or been a part of anti-\nIsrael activity or propoganda.  The ADL is simply monitoring them so that if\nanything comes up, they won't be caught by surprise.\n\n\n\nNo, that is why World Trade Center bombings don't happen in Israel (aside from\nthe fact that there is no world trade center) and why people like Zein Isa (\nPalestinian whose American group planned to bow up the Israeli Embassy and \n"kill many Jews.") are caught.  As Mordechai Levy of the JDL said, Paranoid\nJews live longer.\n\n\n\nThey probably do.
You apparently think you are some sort of one-man judge and jury who\ncan declare "total" victory and then sit back and enjoy the\napplause.  But you've picked the wrong topic if you think a few\nrigged "quotations" can sustain the legend and lie of the Deir\nYassin "massacre."\n\nYou have a lot to learn when it comes to historical methodology.\nAt the most basic level, you should know that there is a big\ndifference between weighing evidence fairly and merely finding\n"quotations" that support your preset opinions.\n\nIf you have studied the history of Israel at all you must know that\nmany of the sources of your "quotations" have an axe to grind, and\ntherefore you must be very careful about whom you "quote."  For\nexample, Meir Pa'il, whom you cite, was indeed a general, a scholar,\nand a war hero.  But that doesn't mean everything that comes out of\nhis mouth is gold.  In fact (and here your lack of experience\nshows), Pa'il is such a fanatic, embittered leftist that much of his\nanti-Israel blathering (forget about anti-Irgun blathering) would be\nconsidered something like treason in non-Israel contexts.  But of\ncourse you don't consider this AT ALL when you find a juicy\n"quotation" that you can use to attack Israel.\n\nBenny Morris (of Hashomer Hatzair) represents himself as a "scholar"\nwhen he rehashes the old attacks on the Irgun.  Don't be fooled.\nIt's just the old Zionist ideological catfight, surfacing as an\nattack on the (then-) Likud government.  If you will look closely at\nthe section on Deir Yassin in his book on the War of Independence,\nyou will see his "indictment" to be pure hot air.  And this is the\nBEST HE CAN DO after decades of digging for any sort of damning\nevidence.  Unfortunately for him, because his book parades itself as\n"scholarly," he is forced to put footnotes.  So you can clearly see\nthat his Deir Yassin account is based on nothing.\n\nThe Deir Yassin "massacre" never took place as the propagandists\ntell it, any more than the Sabra and Shatila "massacres." Do you get\nthe feeling people like to blame the Jews for "massacres," even if\nthey have to make them up?  It must sound spicy.  Even some Jews\nlike to do it, for reasons of their own.\n\nPlease, don't confuse any of you Deir Yassin "massacre" stuff\nwith facts or scholarship.  You should stick to Begin's version\nunless you find something serious to contradict it.
I'm sure the Federal Bureau of Investigation (fbi.gov on the Internet) is going\nto *love* reading your incitement to murder.
Yes it is, as has been evidenced by the previous two stages\nof withdrawal from the area and by the reductions in troops.\nCurrently the troops are kept at a level consistent with light\nand armored patrols.  No permanent installations have been\nbuilt in the area, nor are any planned.\n\nAs to the prodigal "water question",  you can continue to waste\nyour time looking for non-existent proof, or you can accept the\ntestimony of people here, some Lebanese, who have acknowledged\nthat they know of no evidence for these allegations.\n\n\nIt depends which of those territories you refer to.\nIn general, settlers were moved into the territories because\nat the time, in the context of the situations, it seemed the\nlogical move.  This is not to say that views don't change\nor that mistakes are not made.  Currently, I would say that\nthe only "disputed territory" that does not appear to be temporary\nis that of Eastern and northern Jerusalem.
Sorry guys for this long article, but in fact it is mostly quotings..\n\n \n\nwell, if you just waited for 5 more lines you would have read my statement\n"Secondly, surely israeli have human rights, but ..."\n\n\nbecause they belong to the human race, or do you disagree on that too ?\n\n\nI donot know about you, but it makes full sense to me.\nIsraelis are being killed because Israel is occupying , Let israel withdraw\nand israeli blood will be saved. It isNOT the palestineans who undermined\nthe right of life of israelis, but it is israel which occupied and exposed \nthe life of its citizens to the the unconcluded war of 1967 !\n\nMore generally, the violence in the occupied terretories is part of the intifada,\nand i had previously posted a "long" article about this issue, whom i finished\nby an open question:\nSuppose the Intifada stops, What is the motive for Israel to withdraw ?\ndonot tell hope for peace and this bullshit. Everybody in the world looks\nand hopes for peace, so why isnot there any. hope of peace is necessary\nbut not sufficient motive.\n\n\n\nAs for the Arabian countries, their problems are an Arabian concern. \nthe Arabian people can deal with it themselves, if the west doesnot intervene.\nAs for Serbs, I donot think that those FUCKED UP RAPISTS (excuse my language\nbut it really hurts as much if I was in Bosnia itself) areNOT humans. Those\nsurely came from outer space or something. No human can allow himself\nto see such attrocities than to participate in.\n \n\nOk.\n\n\nMy definition is the same as yours, but one has to look into the world politics.\nIn politics, a "solution" doesNOT imply "JUST solution".\n\n\nIt seems that it was problem in the definition of "solution".\nI think a solution must be just, because otherwise it would never be lasting.\nHowever, when politicians say a solution, they donot mean a just solution but \njust a solution.

We paid for it in human casualties and crippled fates--the\nprice was too great! Now, after the Sumgait tragedy, we, the victims, divide\nour lives into "before" and ''after." We talk like that: that was before the\nwar. Like the people who went through World War II and considered it a whole\nepoch, a fate. No matter how many years go by, no matter how long we live,\nit will never be forgotten. On the contrary, some of the moments become even \nsharper: in our rage, in our sorrow, we saw everything differently, but now\n. . . They say that you can see more with distance, and we can see those\ninhuman events with more clarity now . . . we more acutely perceive our\nlosses and everything that happened.\n\nNineteen eighty-eight was a leap year. Everyone fears a leap year and wants it\nto pass as quickly as possible. Yet we never thought that that leap year would\nbe such a black one for every Sumgait Armenian: those who lost someone and \nthose who didn't.\n\nThat second to last day of winter was ordinary for our family, although you \ncould already smell danger in the air. But we didn't think that the danger was\nnear and possible, so we didn't take any steps to save ourselves. At least, as\nmy parents say, at least we should have done something to save the children. \nMy parents themselves are not that old, 52 and 53 years. But then they thought\nthat they had already lived enough, and did everything they could to save us.\n\nIn our apartment the tragedy started on February 28, around five in the\nafternoon. I call it a tragedy, and I repeat: it was a tragedy even though all\nour family survived. When I recall how they broke down our door my skin\ncrawls; even now, among Armenians, among people who wish me only well, I feel\nlike it's all starting over again. I remember how that mob broke into our \napartment . . . My parents were standing in the hall. My father had an axe in \nhis hands and had immediately locked both of the doors. Our door was rarely \nlocked since friends and neighbors often dropped by. We're known as a \nhospitable family, and we just never really thought about whether the people \nwho were coming to see us were Azerbaijanis, Jews, or Russians. We had friends\nof many nationalities, even a Turkmen woman.\n\nMy parents were in the hall, my father with an axe. I remember him telling my \nmother, "Run to the kitchen for a knife." But Mother was detached, pale, as \nthough she had decided to sell her life a bit dearer. To be honest I never \nexpected it of her, she's afraid of getting shot and afraid of the dark. A \ngirlfriend was at the house that day, a Russian girl, Lyuda, and Mamma said, \n"No matter what happens, no matter what they do to us, you're not to come out \nof the bedroom. We're going to tell them that we're alone in the apartment."\n\nWe went into the bedroom. There were four of us. Marina and the Russian girl \ncrawled under the bed, and we covered them up with a rug, boxes of dishes, and\nKarina and I are standing there and looking at one another. The idea that \nperhaps we were seeing each other for the last time flashed somewhere inside \nme. I'm an emotional person and I express my emotions immediately. I wanted to\nembrace her and kiss her, as though it were the last second. And maybe Karina \nwas thinking the same thing, but she's quite reserved. We didn't have time to \nsay anything to each other because we immediately heard Mamma raise a shout. \nThere was so much noise from the tramping of feet, from the shouting, and from\nexcited voices. I couldn't figure what was going on out there because the door\nto the bedroom was only open a crack. But when Mamma shouted the second time\nKarina ran out of the bedroom. I ran after her, I had wanted to hold her back,\nbut when she opened the door and ran out into the hall they saw us \nimmediately. The only thing I managed to do was close the door behind me, at \nleast so as to save Marina and her friend. The mob was shouting, all of their \neyes were shining, all red, like from insomnia. At first about 40 people burst\nin, but later I was standing with my back to the door and couldn't see. They \ncame into the hall, into the kitchen, and dragged my father into the other \nroom. He didn't utter a word, he just raised the axe to hit them, but Mamma \nsnatched the axe from behind and said, "Tell them not to touch the children. \nTell them they can do as they want with us, but not to harm the children." She\nsaid this to Father in Armenian.\n\nThere were Azerbaijanis from Armenia among the mob who broke in. They \nunderstood Armenian perfectly. The local Azerbaijanis don't know Armenian, \nthey don't need to speak it. And one of them responded in Armenian: "You and \nyour children both . . . we're going to do the same thing to you and your \nchildren that you Armenians did in Kafan. They killed our women, our girls, \nour mothers, they cut their breasts off, and burned our houses . . . ," and \nso on and so forth, "and we came to do the same thing to you." This whole time\nsome of them are destroying the house and the others are shouting at us. They \nwere mostly young people, under 30. At first there weren't any older people \namong them. And all of their faces were unfamiliar. Sumgait is a small town, \nall the same, and we know a lot of people by their faces, especially me, I'm \na teacher.\n\nSo they dragged my father into the other room. They twisted his arms and took \nhim in there, no they didn't take him in there, they dragged him in there,\nbecause he was already unable to walk. They closed the door to that room all \nbut a crack. We couldn't see what was happening to Father, what they were \ndoing to him. Then a young man, about 26 years old, started to tear off \nMamma's sarafan, and Mamma shouted at him in Azerbaijani: "I'm old enough to \nbe your mother! What are you doing?!" He struck her. Now he's being held, \nMamma identified him. I hope he's convicted. Then they went after Karina, \nwho's been talking to them like a Komsomol leader, as though she were trying \nto lead them down a different path, as they say, to influence their \nconsciousness. She told them that what they were doing was wrong, that they \nmustn't do it. She said, "Come on, let's straighten this out, without \nemotions. What do you want? Who are you? Why did you come here? What did we \never do to you?" Someone tried to explain who they were and why they had come \ninto our home, but then the ones in the back--more of them kept coming and \ncoming--said, "What are you talking to, them for. You should kill them. We \ncame here to kill them."\n\nThey pushed Karina, struck her, and she fell down. They beat her, but she \ndidn't cry out. Even when they tore her clothes off, she kept repeating, "What\ndid we do to you? What did we do to you?" And even later, when she came to, \nshe said, "Mamma, what did we do to them? Why did they do that to us?"\n\nThat group was prepared, I know this because I noticed that some of them only \nbroke up furniture, and others only dealt with us. I remember that when they \nwere beating me, when they were tearing my clothes off, I felt neither pain \nnor shame because my entire attention was riveted to Karina. All I could do \nwas watch how much they beat her and how painful it was for her, and what they\ndid to her. That's why I felt no pain. Later, when they carried Karina off, \nthey beat her savagely . . . It's really amazing that she not only lived, but \ndidn't lose her mind . She is very beautiful and they did everything they \ncould to destroy her beauty. Mostly they beat her face, with their fists, \nkicking her, using anything they could find.\n\nMamma, Karina, and I were all in one room. And again I didn't feel any pain, \njust didn't feel any, no matter how much they beat me, no matter what they \ndid. Then one of those creeps said that there wasn't enough room in the\napartment. They broke up the beds and the desk and moved everything into the \ncorners so there would be more room. Then someone suggested, "Let's take her \noutside."\n\nThose beasts were in Heaven. They did what they would do every day if they \nweren't afraid of the authorities. Those were their true colors. At the time \nI thought that in fact they would always behave that way if they weren't \nafraid of what would happen to them.\n\nWhen they carried Karina out and beat Mamma-her face was completely covered \nwith blood--that's when I started to feel the pain. I blacked out several \ntimes from the pain, but each moment that I had my eyes open it was as though \nI were recording it all on film. I think I'm a kind person by nature, but I'm \nvengeful, especially if someone is mean to me, and I don't deserve it. I hold \na grudge a long time if someone intentionally causes me pain. And every time \nI would come to and see one of those animals on top of me, I'd remember them, \nand I'll remember them for the rest of my life, even though people tell me \n"forget," you have to forget, you have to go on living.\n\nAt some point I remember that they stood me up and told me something, and \ndespite the fact that I hurt all over--I had been beaten terribly--I found\nthe strength in myself to interfere with their tortures. I realized that I had\nto do something: resist them or just let them kill me to bring my suffering \nto an end. I pushed one of them away, he was a real horse. I remember now that\nhe's being held, too. As though they were all waiting for it, they seized me\nand took me out onto the balcony. I had long hair, and it was stuck all over\nme. One of the veranda shutters to the balcony was open, and I realized that\nthey planned to throw me out the window, because they had already picked me up\nwith their hands, I was up in the air. As though for the last time I took a \nreally deep breath and closed my eyes, and somehow braced myself inside, I \nsuddenly became cold, as though my heart had sunk into my feet. And suddenly \nI felt myself flying. I couldn't figure out if I was really flying or if I \njust imagined it. When I came to I thought now I'm going to smash on the \nground. And when it didn't happen I opened my eyes and realized that I was \nstill lying on the floor. And since I didn't scream, didn't beg them at all,\nthey became all the more wild, like wolves. They started to trample me with\ntheir feet. Shoes with heels on them, and iron horseshoes, like they had spe-\ncially put them on. Then I lost consciousness.\n\nI came to a couple of times and waited for death, summoned it, beseeched it. \nSome people ask for good health, life, happiness, but at that moment I didn't \nneed any of those things. I was sure that none of us would survive, and I had \neven forgotten about Marina; and if none of us was alive, it wasn't worth \nliving.\n\nThere was a moment when the pain was especially great. I withstood inhuman \npain, and realized that they were going to torment me for a long time to come \nbecause I had showed myself to be so tenacious. I started to strangle myself, \nand when I started to wheeze they realized that with my death I was going to\nput an end to their pleasures, and they pulled my hands from my throat. The \nperson who injured and insulted me most painfully I remember him very well, \nbecause he was the oldest in the group. He looked around 48. I know that he \nhas four children and that he considers himself an ideal father and person, \none who would never do such a thing. Something came over him then, you see, \neven during the investigation he almost called me "daughter," he apologized, \nalthough, of course, he knew that I'd never forgive him. Something like that \nI can never forgive. I have never injured anyone with my behavior, with my \nwords, or with my deeds, I have always put myself in the other person's shoes,\nbut then, in a matter of hours, they trampled me entirely. I shall never \nforget it.\n\nI wanted to do myself in then, because I had nothing to lose, because no one \ncould protect me. My father, who tried to do something against that hoard of \nbeasts by himself, could do nothing and wouldn't be able to do anything.\nI knew that I was even sure that he was no longer alive.\n\nAnd Ira Melkumian, my acquaintance I knew her and had been to see her family a\ncouple of times--her brother tried to save her and couldn't, so he tried to \nkill her, his very own sister. He threw an axe at her to kill her and put an \nend to her suffering. When they stripped her clothes off and carried her into \nthe other room, her brother knew what awaited her. I don't know which one it \nwas, Edik or Igor. Both of them were in the room from which the axe was \nthrown. But the axe hit one of the people carrying her and so they killed her \nand made her death even more excruciating, maybe the most excruciating of all \nthe deaths of those days in Sumgait. I heard about it all from the neighbor \nfrom the Melkumians' landing. His name is Makhaddin, he knows my family a \nlittle. He came to see how we had gotten settled in the new apartment in Baku,\nhow we were feeling, and if we needed anything. He's a good person. He said, \n"You should praise God that you all survived. But what I saw with my own eyes,\nI, a man, who has seen so many people die, who has lived a whole life, I," he\nsays, "nearly lost my mind that day. I had never seen the likes of it and \nthink I never shall again." The door to his apartment was open and he saw \neverything. One of the brothers threw the axe, because they had already taken \nthe father and mother out of the apartment. Igor, Edik, and Ira remained. He \nsaw Ira, naked, being carried into the other room in the hands of six or seven\npeople. He told us about it and said he would never forget it. He heard the \nbrothers shouting something, inarticulate from pain, rage, and the fact that \nthey were powerless to do anything. But all the same they tried to \ndo something. The guy who got hit with the axe lived.                                                                           I     I\n\nAfter I had been unsuccessful at killing myself I saw them taking Marina and \nLyuda out of the bedroom. I was in such a state that I couldn't even \nremember my sister's name. I wanted to cry "Marina!" out to her, but could\nnot. I looked at her and knew that it was a familiar, dear face, but couldn't\nfor the life of me remember what her name was and who she was. And thus\nI saved her, because when they were taking her out, she, as it turns out, had\ntold them that she had just been visiting and that she and Lyuda were both\nthere by chance, that they weren't Armenians. Lyuda's a Russian, you can tell \nright away, and Marina speaks Azerbaijani wonderfully and she told them that\nshe was an Azerbaijani. And I almost gave her away and doomed her. I'm glad \nthat at least Marina came out of this all in good physical health . . . \nalthough her spirit was murdered . . .\n\nAt some point I came to and saw Igor, Igor Agayev, my acquaintance, in that \nmob. He lives in the neighboring building. For some reason I remembered his \nname, maybe I sensed my defense in him. I called out to him in Russian, "Igor,\nhelp!" But he turned away and went into the bedroom. Just then they were \ntaking Marina and Lyuda out of the bedroom. Igor said he knew Marina and \nLyuda, that Marina in fact was Azerbaijani, and he took both of them to the \nneighbors.\n\nAnd the idea stole through me that maybe Igor had led them to our apartment, \nsomething like that, but if he was my friend, he was supposed to save me.\n \nThen they were striking me very hard--we have an Indian vase, a metal one, \nthey were hitting me on the back with it and I blacked out--they took me out \nonto the balcony a second time to throw me out the window. They were already \nsure that I was dead because I didn't react at all to the new blows. Someone \nsaid, "She's already dead, let's throw her out." When they carried me out onto\nthe balcony for the second time, when I was about to die the second time, I \nheard someone say in Azerbaijani: "Don't kill her, I know her, she's a \nteacher." I can still hear that voice ringing in my ears, but I can't remember\nwhose voice it was. It wasn't Igor, because he speaks Azerbaijani with an \naccent: his mother is Russian and they speak Russian at home. He speaks\nAzerbaijani worse than our Marina does. I remember when they carried me in and\nthrew me on the bed he came up to me, that person, and 	I having opened my \neyes, saw and recognized that person, but immediately passed out cold. I had \nbeen beaten so much that I didn't have the strength to remember him. I only \nremember that this person was older and he had a high position. Unfortunately \nI can't remember anything more.\n\nWhat should I say about Igor? He didn't treat me badly. I had heard a lot \nabout him, that he wasn't that good a person, that he sometimes drank too\nmuch. Once he boasted to me that he had served in Afghanistan. He knew that \nwomen usually like bravery in a man. Especially if a man was in Afghanistan,\nif he was wounded, then it's about eighty percent sure that he will be treated\nvery sympathetically, with respect. Later I found out that he had served in \nUfa, and was injured, but that's not in Afghanistan, of course. I found that \nall out later.\n\nAmong the people who were in our apartment, my Karina also saw the Secretary \nof the Party organization. I don't know his last name, his first name is \nNajaf, he is an Armenian-born Azerbaijani. But later Karina wasn't so sure,\nshe was no longer a hundred percent sure that it was he she saw, and she \ndidn't want to endanger him. She said, "He was there," and a little while \nlater, "Maybe they beat me so much that I am confusing him with someone else. \nNo, it seems like it was he." I am sure it was he because when he came to see \nus the first time he said one thing, and the next time he said something \nentirely different. The investigators haven't summoned him yet. He came to see\nus in the Khimik boarding house where we were living at the time. He brought \ngroceries and flowers, this was right before March 8th; he almost started \ncrying, he was so upset to see our condition. I don't know if he was putting \nus on or not, but later, after we had told the investigator and they summoned \nhim to the Procuracy, he said that he had been in Baku, he wasn't in Sumgait. \nThe fact that he changed his testimony leads me to believe that Karina is \nright, that in fact it was he who was in our apartment. I don't know how the \ninvestigators are now treating him. At one point I wondered and asked, and was\ntold that he had an alibi and was not in our apartment. Couldn't he have gone \nto Baku and arranged an alibi? I'm not ruling out that possibility.\n\nIll now return to our apartment. Mamma had come to. You could say that she \nbought them off with the gold Father gave her when they were married: her \nwedding band and her watch were gold. She bought her own and her husband's \nlives with them. She gave the gold to a 14-year old boy. Vadim Vorobyev. A \nRussian boy, he speaks Azerbaijani perfectly. He's an orphan who was raised by\nhis grandfather and who lives in Sumgait on Nizami Street. He goes to a \nspecial school, one for mentally handicapped children. But I'll say this--I'm \na teacher all the same and in a matter of minutes I can form an opinion--that\nboy is not at all mentally handicapped. He's healthy, he can think just fine, \nand analyze, too . . . policemen should be so lucky. And he's cunning, too. \nAfter that he went home and tore all of the pictures out of his photo album.\n\nHe beat Mamma and demanded gold, saying, "Lady, if you give us all the gold \nand money in your apartment we'll let you live." And Mamma told them where \nthe gold was. He brought in the bag and opened it, shook out the contents, and \neveryone who was in the apartment jumped on it, started knocking each other \nover and taking the gold from one another. I'm surprised they didn't kill one \nanother right then.\n\nMamma was still in control of herself. She had been beaten up, her face was\nblack and blue from the blows, and her eyes were filled with blood, and she \nran into the other room. Father was lying there, tied up, with a gag in his\nmouth and a pillow over his face. There was a broken table on top of the pil-\nlow. Mamma grabbed Father and he couldn't walk; like me, he was half dead, \nhalfway into the other world. He couldn't comprehend anything, couldn't see, \nand was covered with black and blue. Mamma pulled the gag out of his mouth, \nit was some sort of cloth, I think it was a slipcover from an armchair.\n\nThe bandits were still in our apartment, even in the room Mamma pulled Father \nout of, led him out of, carried him out of. We had two armchairs in that room,\na small magazine table, a couch, a television, and a screen. Three people \nwere standing next to that screen, and into their shirts, their pants, \neverywhere imaginable, they were shoving shot glasses and cups from the coffee\nservice--Mamma saw them out of the corner of her eye. She said, "I was afraid \nto turn around, I just seized Father and started pulling him, but at the \nthreshold I couldn't hold him up, he fell down, and I picked him up again and \ndragged him down the stairs to the neighbors'." Mamma remembered one of the \ncriminals, the one who had watched her with his face half-turned toward her, \nout of one eye. She says, "I realized that my death would come from that \nperson. I looked him in the eyes and he recoiled from fear and went stealing."\nLater they caught that scoundrel. Meanwhile, Mamma grabbed Father and left.\n\nI was alone. Igor had taken Marina away, Mamma and Father were gone, Karina \nwas already outside, I didn't know what they were doing to her. I was left all\nalone, and at that moment . . . I became someone else, do you understand? Even\nthough I knew that neither Mother and Father in the other room, nor Marina and\nLyuda under the bed could save me, all the same I somehow managed to hold out.\nI went on fighting them, I bit someone, I remember, and I scratched another. \nBut when I was left alone I realized what kind of people they were, the ones \nI had observed, the ones who beat Karina, what kind of people they were, the \nones who beat me, that it was all unnecessary, that I was about to die and \nthat all of that would die with me.\n\nAt some point I took heart when I saw the young man from the next building. I \ndidn't know his name, but we would greet one another when we met, we knew that\nwe were from the same microdistrict. When I saw him I said, "Neighbor, is that\nyou?" In so doing I placed myself in great danger. He realized that if I lived\nI would remember him. That's when he grabbed the axe. The axe that had been \ntaken from my father. I automatically fell to my knees and raised my hands to \ntake the blow of the axe, although at the time it would have been better if he\nhad struck me in the head with the axe and put me out of my misery. When he \nstarted getting ready to wind back for the blow, someone came into the room. \nThe newcomer had such an impact on everyone that my neighbor's axe froze in \nthe air. Everyone stood at attention for this guy, like soldiers in the \npresence of a general. Everyone waited for his word: continue the atrocities \nor not. He said, "Enough, let's go to the third entryway." In the third \nentryway they killed Uncle Shurik, Aleksandr Gambarian. This confirms once \nagain that they had prepared in advance. Almost all of them left with him, as \nthey went picking up pillows, blankets, whatever they needed, whatever they \nfound, all the way up to worn out slippers and one boot, someone else had \nalready taken the other.\n\nFour people remained in the room, soldiers who didn't obey their general. They\nhad to have come recently, because other faces had flashed in front of me over\nthose 2 to 3 hours, but I had never seen those three. One of them, Kuliyev (I \nidentified him later), a native of the Sisian District of Armenia, an \nAzerbaijani, had moved to Azerbaijan a year before. He told me in Armenian:\n"Sister, don't be afraid, I'll drive those three Azerbaijanis out of here."\nThat's just what he said, "those Azerbaijanis," as though he himself were not \nAzerbaijani, but some other nationality, he said with such hatred, "I'll drive\nthem out of here now, and you put your clothes on, and find a hammer and nails\nand nail the door shut, because they'll be coming back from Apartment 41." \nThat's when I found out that they had gone to Apartment 41. Before that, the \nperson in the Eskimo dogskin coat, the one who came in and whom they listened \nto, the "general," said that they were going to the third entryway.\n\nKuliyev helped me get some clothes on, because l couldn't do it by myself. \nMarina's old fur coat was lying on the floor. He threw it over my shoulders, I\nwas racked with shivers, and he asked where he could find nails and a hammer. \nHe wanted to give them to me so that when he left I could nail the door shut. \nBut the door was lying on the floor in the hall.\n\nI went out onto the balcony. There were broken windows, and flowers and dirt \nfrom flowerpots were scattered on the floor. It was impossible to find \nanything. He told me, "Well, fine, I won't leave you here. Would any of the \nneighbors let you in? They'll be back, they won't calm down, they know you're \nalive." He told me all this in Armenian.\n\nThen he returned to the others and said, "What are you waiting for? Leave!" \nThey said, "Ah, you just want to chase us out of here and do it with her \nyourself. No, we want to do it to." He urged them on, but gently, not \ncoarsely, because he was alone against them, although they were still just\nboys, not old enough to be drafted. He led them out of the room, and went\ndown to the third floor with them himself, and said, "Leave. What's the mat-\nter, aren't you men? Go fight with the men. What do you want of her?" And\nhe came back upstairs. They wanted to come up after him and he realized that \nhe couldn't hold them off forever. Then he asked me where he could hide me. I \ntold him at the neighbors' on the fourth floor, Apartment 10, we were on really\ngood terms with them.\n\nWe knocked on the door, and he explained in Azerbaijani. The neighbor woman \nopened the door and immediately said, "I'm an Azerbaijani." He said, "I know. \nLet her sit at your place a while. Don't open the door to anyone, no one knows\nabout this, I won't tell anyone. Let her stay at your place." She says, "Fine,\nhave her come in." I went in. She cried a bit and gave me some stockings, I \nhad gone entirely numb and was racked with nervous shudders. I burst into \ntears. Even though I was wearing Marina's old fur coat, it's a short one, a \nhalf-length, I was cold all the same. I asked, "Do you know where my family \nis, what happened to them?" She says, "No, I don't know anything. I'm afraid \nto go out of the apartment, now they're so wild that they don't look to see \nwho's Azerbaijani and who's Armenian." Kuliyev left. Ten minutes later my \nneighbor says, "You know, Lyuda, I don't want to lose my life because of you, \nor my son and his wife. Go stay with someone else." During the butchery in our\napartment one of the scum, a sadist, took my earring in his mouth--I had pearl\nearrings on--and ripped it out, tearing the earlobe. The other earring was \nstill there. When I'm nervous I fix my hair constantly, and then, when I \ntouched my ear, I noticed that I had one earring on. I took it out and gave it\nto her. She took the earring, but she led me out of the apartment.\n\nI went out and didn't know where to go. I heard someone going upstairs. I \ndon't know who it was but assumed it was them. With tremendous difficulty I \nend up to our apartment, I wanted to die in my own home. I go into the \napartment and hear that they are coming up to our place, to the fifth floor. \nI had to do something. I went into the bedroom where Marina and Lyuda had \nhidden and saw that the bed was overturned. Instead of hiding I squatted near \nsome broken Christmas ornaments, found an unbroken one, and started sobbing. \nThen they came in. Someone said that there were still some things to take. I \nthink that someone pushed me under the bed. I lay on the floor, and there were\nbroken ornaments on it, under my head and legs. I got all cut up, but I lay \nthere without moving. My heart was beating so hard it seemed the whole town \ncould hear it. There were no lights on. Maybe that's what saved me. They were \nburning matches, and toward the end they brought in a candle. They started\npicking out the clothes that could still be worn. They took Father's sport \njacket and a bedspread, the end of which was under my head. They pulled on the\none end, and it felt like they were pulling my hair out. I almost cried out. \nAnd again I realized I wasn't getting out of there alive, and I started to \nstrangle myself again. I took my throat in one hand, and pressed the other on \nmy mouth, so as not to wheeze, so that I would die and they would only find me\nafterward. They were throwing the burned matches under the bed, and I got \nburned, but I withstood it. Something inside of me held on, someone's hand was\nprotecting me to the end. I knew that I was going to die, but I didn't know \nhow. I knew that if I survived I would walk out of that apartment, but if \nI found out that one of my family had died, I would die for sure, because I \nhad never been so close to death and couldn't imagine how you could go on \nliving without your mother or father, or without your sister. Marina, I \nthought, was still alive: she went to Lyuda's place or someone is hiding her. \nI tried to think that Igor wouldn't let them be killed. He served in \nAfghanistan, he should protect her.\n\nWhile I was strangling myself I said my good-byes to everyone. And then I\nthought, how could Marina survive alone. If they killed all of us, how would \nshe live all by herself? There were six people in the room. They talked among \nthemselves and smoked. One talked about his daughter, saying that there was no\nchildren's footwear in our apartment that he could take for his daughter. \nAnother said that he liked the apartment--recently we had done a really good \njob fixing everything up--and that he would live there after everything was \nall over. They started to argue. A third one says, "How come you get it? I \nhave four children, and there are three rooms here, that's just what I need. \nAll these years I've been living in God-awful places." Another one says, \n"Neither of you gets it. We'll set fire to it and leave." Then someone said \nthat Azerbaijanis live right next door, the fire could move over to their\nplace. And they, to my good fortune, didn't set fire to the apartment, and\nleft.\n\nOh, yes, I just remembered. While they were raping me they repeated quite \nfrequently, "Let the Armenian women have babies for us, Muslim babies, let \nthem bear Azerbaijanis for the struggle against the Armenians." Then they \nsaid, "Those Muslims can carry on our holy cause. Heroes!" They repeated it \nvery often.\n\n		     - - - reference for #008 - - -\n\n[1] _The Sumgait Tragedy; Pogroms against Armenians in Soviet Azerbaijan,\n    Volume I, Eyewitness Accounts_, edited by Samuel Shahmuradian, forward by\n    Yelena Bonner, 1990, published by Aristide D.

1/64th or 63/64th?\n\nI must congratulate your analytical and excellent\nreportage about  Diana. From  the writings  of tye\nbiographers  you  quoted,  I can  perceive,  maybe\nchauvinistically,  the  remnants of  her  Armenian\ngenes. Even  though she  is only  1/64th Armenian,\nshe   seems   to   have   many   of   the   strong\ncharacteristics  of Armenian  women. Her  Armenian\nancestry is  traced to Eliza Kewark  (an Armenian\nfrom  India), who  married  the Scottish  merchant\nThedore Forbes.  From the union was  born Kathleen\nScott  Forbes,  who  married  James  Crombie  from\nAberdeen. They  had a  daughter Jane,  who married\nDavid  Littlejohn.  Their  daughter  Ruth  married\nWilliam Gill. Ruth Silvia Gill, the grandmother of\nLady  Diana,   married  Lord  Fermoy,   and  their\ndaughter, Frances  Ruth Burke Roache,  married the\neight Earl of Spencer, who  was the father of Lady\nDiana. It is noteworthy  that Eliza Kewark was also\nreferred  to as  Mrs. Forbesian  (a characteristic\nArmenian  surname  ending).  An  Armenian-Scottish\ngene mix is dynamite.\n\nLevon K. Topuzian\nAssistant Professor\nNorthwestern University\nSkoie, Illinois.\n\nTIME, December 21, 1992 'Letters'\n\n\nYou have set up straw horses and knocked them down. I'm not impressed.\nAnyway, the Armenians tore apart the Ottoman Empire's eastern provinces,\nmassacred 2.5 million defenseless Turkish women, children and elderly \npeople, burned thousands of Turkish and Kurdish villages and exterminated \nthe entire Turkish population of the Armenian dictatorship between \n1914-1920. Such outrageous sleight of hand that is still employed today \nin Armenia brings a depth and verification to the Turkish genocide \nthat is hard to match. A hundred years ago Armenians again thought \nthey could get whatever they wanted through sheer terror like the \nRussian anarchists that they accepted as role models. Several Armenian \nterror groups like ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle \nresorted to the same tactics in the 1980s, butchering scores of innocent\nTurks and their families in the United States and Europe. It seems that \nthey are doing it again, at a different scale, in fascist x-Soviet Armenia \ntoday.\n\n\nSource: Stanford J.

Their hope was their participation in the Russian\n success would be rewarded with an independent Armenian state carved out of\n Ottoman territories.

The ADC is an organization of Arab-*AMERICANS*.\n\nLet me see...you're saying that "most if not all" Arab-AMERICANS should be\nspied on?  You're also saying that "most if not all" Arab-AMERICANS\nshould be views as a national security threat to Israel (and the US, \nas you gratuitously imply in your reference to the WTC bombing, in \nwhich no Arab-AMERICANS were involved)?  By inference, can we assume \nthat you think that anyone of Arab lineage anywhere in the world poses \na threat to Israel and, therefore, should be spied on?\n\nPerhaps, then, on the basis of Pollard spy case (not to mention the\nRosenbergs, etc.) you think that all Jewish Americans should be spied \non by the ADC.\n\nOh, never mind; this whole spying case has obviously so \nconvoluted your sense of right or wrong in these matters that I have \nno wish confuse you further.\n\n\nSo the LA times reporter who had information about him\nsold to the South African government was involved in "anti-Israel\nactivity or propaganda"? Are we to infer that the simple act of\nreporting an event in a newspaper constitutes "anti-Israel\nactivity or propaganda"?  Or was it South Africa?  The LA \ntimes reporter was based in South Africa, after all.
Why do you insist on reposting the entire original post?\nDon't waste bandwidth, please.  You know how picky us non-\nJews can be.  Ha Ha. :|
You somehow missed Nabil's comments, even though you included it in\nyour followup: \n\n  >The number which could have arrived to the Holy Lands must have been\n  >substantially less ude to the harsh desert and the killings between the\n  >Jewish tribes on the way..\n\nI am not aware of "killings between Jewish tribes" in the desert.\n\nThe point of "typical thinking" here is that while Arabs STILL TODAY\nact in the manner you describe, like "any nomadic people occupying a \nland", killing and plundering each other with regularity, others have\nsomehow progressed over time.  It is not surprising then that Arabs\noften accuse others (infidels) of things that they are quite familiar\nwith: civil rights violations, religious discrimination, ethnic\ncleansing, land theft, torture and murder.  It is precisely this \nmechanism at work that leads people to say that Jewish tribes were\nkilling each other in the desert, even without support for such a\nludicrous suggestion.
They certainly are until the Arabs make peace.  Only the most leftist/Arabist\nlunatics call upon Israel to withdraw now.  Most moderates realize that an \nIsraeli withdrawl will be based on the Camp David/242/338/Madrid formulas\nwhich make full peace a prerequisite to territorial concessions.
And anyone who doesn't agree with you is, by your own definitions, a\n"useless fart".  Just like any text that disputes your own "findings"\nis always described as "flawed" or "biased".  In other words, you\ntrumpet the things you like and dismiss those that might embarass you.\nWe've seen you play these games here for a long time.\n\nOne thing is for sure: When it comes to "useless farts", you sure know \nwhat you're talking about.
Since one is also unlikely to get "the truth" from either Arab or \nPalestinian news outlets, where do we go to "understand", to learn? \nIs one form of propoganda more reliable than another? The only way \nto determine that is to try and get beyond the writer's "political\nagenda", whether it is "on" or "against" our *side*.\n\nTim
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nO.K., its my turn:\n\n       DRIVING THE JEWS INTO THE SEA ?!\n\nI am sick and tired of this 'DRIVING THE JEWS INTO THE SEA' sentance attributed\nto Islamic movements and the PLO; it simply can't be proven as part of their\nplan !\n\n(Pro Israeli activists repeat it like parrots without checking its authenticity\nsince it was coined by Bnai Brith)\n\nWhat Hamas and Islamic Jihad believe in, as far as I can get from the Arab media,\nis an Islamic state that protects the rights of all its inhabitants under Koranic\nLaw. This would be a reversal of the 1948 situation in which the Jews in\nPalestine took control of the land and its (mostly Muslim) inhabitants.\n\nHowever, whoever committed crimes against humanity (torture, blowing up their\nhomes, murders,...) must be treated and tried as a war criminal. The political\nthought of these movements shows that a freedom of choice will be given to the\nJews in living under the new law or leaving to the destintion of their choice.\n\nAs for the PLO, I am at a loss to explain what is going inside Arafat's mind.\n\nAlthough their political thinking seems far fetched with Israel acting as a true\nsuper-power in the region, the Islamic movements are using the same weapon the\nJews used to establish their state : Religion.
You mean he talks about those Jews, who, because of their self\nhatred, spend all their time attacking Judaism, Jews, and Israel,\nusing the most despicable of anti-Semetic stereotypes?\n\n	I don't think we need to coin a term like "Jedeo-Nazism" to\nrefer to those Jews who, in their endless desire to be accepted by the\nNazis, do their dirty work for them.  We can just call them house\nJews, fools, or anti-Semites from Jewish families.\n\n	I think "house Jews," a reference to a person of Jewish\nancestry who issues statements for a company or organization that\ncondemn Judaism is perfectly sufficeint.  I think a few years free of\ntheir anti-Semetic role models would do wonders for most of them.\n\nAdam\n\nAdam Shostack 				       adam@das.harvard.edu
How many of you readers know anything about Jews living in the\nArab countries?  How many of you know if Jews still live in these\ncountries?  How many of you know what the circumstances of Arabic\nJews leaving their homelands were?  Just curious.
Troglodytism does not necessarily imply a low cultural level.\nThe image-conscious Armenians sorely feel a missing glory in \ntheir background. Armenians have never achieved statehood and \nindependence, they have always been subservient, and engaged \nin undermining schemes against their rulers. They committed \ngenocide against the Muslim populations of Eastern Anatolia \nand Armenian Dictatorship before and during World War I and \nfully participated in the extermination of the European Jewry \nduring World War II. Belligerence, genocide, back-stabbing, \nrebelliousness and disloyalty have been the hallmarks of the \nArmenian history. To obliterate these episodes the Armenians \nengaged in tailoring history to suit their whims. In this zeal \nthey tried to cover up the cold-blooded genocide of 2.5 million \nTurks and Kurds before and during World War I.\n\nAnd, you don't pull nations out of a hat.\n\n\nSource: Walker, Christopher: "Armenia: The Survival of a Nation."\n        New York (St. Martin's Press), 1980.\n\nThis generally pro-Armenian work contains the following information\nof direct relevance to the Nazi Holocaust: \n\na) Dro (the butcher), the former Dictator of the Armenian Dictatorship and\nthe architect of the Genocide of 2.5 million Turks and Kurds, the most \nrespected of Nazi Armenian leaders, established an Armenian Provisional \nRepublic in Berlin during World War II; \n\nb) this 'provisional government' fully endorsed and espoused the social \ntheories of the Nazis, declared themselves and all Armenians to be members \nof the Aryan 'Super-Race;' \n\nc) they published an Anti-Semitic, racist journal, thereby aligning themselves \nwith the Nazis and their efforts to exterminate the Jews; and, \n\nd) they mobilized an Armenian Army of up to 20,000 members which fought side \nby side with the Wehrmacht.\n\n\nSerdar Argic

Although two months\n have elapsed since the clearing of the territories of Armenian gangs, I\n have been observing the evidence of the cruelties of the Armenians at \n almost every step. All the villages from Trabzon to Erzincan and from\n Erzincan to Erzurum are destroyed. Corpses of Turks brutally and cruelly\n slain are everywhere. According to accounts by those who were able to\n save their lives by escaping to mountains, the first horrible and fearful\n events begun when the Russian forces evacuated the places which were then\n taken over by Armenian gangs. The Russians usually treated the people \n well, but the people feared the intervention of the Armenians. Once these\n places had been taken over by the Armenians, however, the massacres begun.\n They clearly announced their intention of clearing what they called the\n Armenian and Kurdish land from the Turks and thus, solve the nationality\n problem. Today I had the opportunity to meet Austrian and German soldiers\n who had escaped from Russian prison camps and come from Kars and\n Alexander Paul (Gumru-Leninakan)...Russian officers tried to save the \n Turks and there were clashes between Russian officers and Armenian gangs. \n I am now in Erzurum, and what I see is terrible. Almost the whole city is \n destroyed. The smell of the corpses still fills the air. Although there are \n speculations that Armenian gangs murdered Austrian and German prisoners as \n well, I could not get the supporting evidence in this regard, but there is \n proof of murdering of Turkish prisoners of war."\n\n                                                     Dr. Stephan Eshnanie\n\nSerdar Argic
Koc) responded to article <1993Apr22.152937.14766@urartu.sdpa.org> dbd@urartu.\n\n[DD]  Problem 1\n[DD]\n[DD] My father told me the following story. During the famous wars between the \n[DD] Armenians and the Persians, prince Zaurak Kamsarakan performed \n[DD] extraordinary heroic deeds. Three times in a single month he attacked the \n[DD] Persian troops. The first time, he struck down half of the Persian army. \n[DD] The second time, pursuing the Persians, he slaughtered one fourth of the \n[DD] soldiers. The third time, he destroyed one eleventh of the Persian army. \n[DD] The Persians who were still alive, numbering two hundred eighty, fled to \n[DD] Nakhichevan. And so, from this remainder, find how many Persian soldiers \n[DD] there were before the massacre.\n\n[Koc] Answer: a(1-1/2-1/4-1/11)=280 -> a = 1760\n\nGood for you! You win the prize -- a free trip to Karabakh as an Azeri \nsoldier! Now, calculate the odds of you coming back after trying to de-populate\nthe area of Armenians!\n\n[Koc] Corollary: Armenians strike, slaughter, destroy, and massacre. After\n[Koc] all, they are not as innocent as the asala network claims.\n\nFact: I didn't notice any mention of Turks in Shirak, Van, or Trebizon in\n      this seventh century story!\n\nFact: These places were filled with Armenians as of 1915.\n\nFact: By the end of 1916, after the Turkish genocide of the Armenians, there\n      were no Armenians left in Shirak, Van, or Trebizon -- only Turks and\n      Kurds! In fact, there were no Pontus Greeks left alive in Trebizon \n      either!\n\nConclusion: Numbers don't lie in either case!
An open letter to Marc Afifi\n\n\nDear Marc,\n	I believe that you are wrong about Mr. Freeman.  He has written in\na style that raises the level of posts on this board.  If you just don't seem\nto get it, I believe that it is more of a reflection of you and your abilities\nthan of him.  His posts contain substance and and he defends his positions \nwell.\n	Having said this, I would like to ask in general for people on this \nboard to realize that if they don't agree with the substance of posts, then they should respond to the substance (or lack of) of the posts rather than attack\nthe author of the posts.  When one has to resort to attacking a poster rather than what he/she has written, one can see that that person does not have the\nability to make a coherent argument concerning the post.\n\nPeace,
Dr. cheghadr bA namakand!  They just wait until they are teenagers to kill\nthem!\n\n\nhuh?\n\n\n\nYup.  IRI also granted a great deal of reconstruction of houses and\nbuildings in war torn areas to Malaysia. Khak too sareshoon, one of the \nonly industries we really have is construction, and there are all these\nunemployed youth, and they give money to Malaysia to do what Iranians\ncan and should be doing.
The Israelis\n   used to arrest and sometimes to kill some of these neutral reporters.\n\nEh????  Could you please give me details about an event where a "Neutral\nObserver" was killed by purpose by an Israeli soldier?\n\n--Amos
I have read numerous posts over a period of several months, by\nthis anti-Israel fanatic, hiding in the shadow of the respectable\nsounding name of the 'Center for Policy Research.'  Obviously, it\nis no research center of any kind, unless 'researching' published\ndocuments to find material to use against Israel makes it so.  \n\n   Labeling a propaganda mill a research center is not surprising\nin itself.  That is simply part of the propaganda process.  I was\ncurious if anyone knew who this anti-Israel fanatic hiding behind\nhis phoney 'research center' name is.  Is he an Arab?  Is he some\ntypical anti-semite hiding behind a veneer of 'anti-zionism?'  Is\nhe some Jew who perhaps lived in Israel and just couldn't make it\nthere, and is now taking his failure out on Israel?
Homeland? First Nagarno-Karabagh was Armenians homeland today\n	Fizuli, Lacin and several villages (in Azerbadjan)\n	are their homeland. Can't you see the\n	the  "Great Armenia" dream in this? With facist methods like\n	killing, raping and bombing villages. The last move was the \n	blast of a truck with 60 kurdish refugees, trying to\n	escape the from Lacin, a city that was "given" to the Kurds\n	by the Armenians. \n\n\n\n	Don't speak about things you don't know: 8 American Cargo planes\n	were heading to Armenia. When the Turkish authorities\n	announced that they were going to search these cargo \n	planes 3 of these planes returned to it's base in Germany.\n	5 of these planes were searched in Turkey. The content of\n	of the other 3 planes? Not hard to guess, is it? It was sure not\n	humanitarian aid.....\n\n	Search Turkish planes? You don't know what you are talking about.\n	Turkey's government has announced that it's giving weapons\n	to Azerbadjan since Armenia started to attack Azerbadjan\n	it self, not the Karabag province. So why search a plane for weapons\n	since it's content is announced to be weapons?
Is this a figment of your imagination? Here is another one:\n\n\n Source: "Mitteilungsblatt, Berlin, December 1939, Nr. 2 and 5-6"\n\n Yet another historical fact: a fact that for years has been deliberately \n forgotten, concealed, and wiped from memory - the fact of Armenian-Nazi \n collaboration.\n\n A magazine called Mitteilungsblatt der Deutsch-Armenischen Gesselschaft\n is the clearest and most definite proof of this collaboration. The \n magazine was first published in Berlin in 1938 during Nazi rule of Germany\n and continued publication until the end of 1944. Even the name of the\n magazine, which implies a declaration of Armenian-Nazi cooperation,\n is attention-getting.\n\n This magazine, every issue of which proves the collaboration, is historically\n important as documentary evidence. It is a heap of writing that should be\n an admonition to world opinion and to all mankind. \n\n In Nazi Germany, Armenians were considered to be an Aryan race and certain\n political, economic, and social rights were thus granted to them. They \n occupied positions in public service and were partners in Nazi practices.\n The whole world of course knows what awaited those who were not considered \n "Aryan" and what befell them.\n\n\nSerdar Argic
From: Center for Policy Research <cpr>\nSubject: Ten questions about Israel\n\n\nTen questions to Israelis\n-------------------------\n\nI would be thankful if any of you who live in Israel could help to\nprovide\n accurate answers to the following specific questions. These are\nindeed provocative questions but they are asked time and again by\npeople around me.\n\n1.      Is it true that the Israeli authorities don't recognize\nIsraeli nationality ? And that ID cards, which Israeli citizens\nmust carry at all times, identify people as Jews or Arabs, not as\nIsraelis ?\n\n2.      Is it true that the State of Israel has no fixed borders\nand that Israeli governments from 1948 until today have refused to\nstate where the ultimate borders of the State of Israel should be\n?\n\n3.      Is it true that Israeli stocks nuclear weapons ? If so,\ncould you provide any evidence ?\n\n4.      Is it true that in Israeli prisons there are a number of\nindividuals which were tried in secret and for which their\nidentities, the date of their trial and their imprisonment are\nstate secrets ?\n\n5.      Is it true that Jews who reside in the occupied\nterritories are subject to different laws than non-Jews?\n\n6.      Is it true that Jews who left Palestine in the war 1947/48\nto avoid the war were automatically allowed to return, while their\nChristian neighbors who did the same were not allowed to return ?\n\n7.      Is it true that Israel's Prime Minister, Y. Rabin, signed\nan order for ethnical cleansing in 1948, as is done today in\nBosnia-Herzegovina ?\n\n8.      Is it true that Israeli Arab citizens are not admitted as\nmembers in kibbutzim?\n\n9.      Is it true that Israeli law attempts to discourage\nmarriages between Jews and non-Jews ?\n\n10.     Is it true that Hotel Hilton in Tel Aviv is built on the\nsite of a muslim cemetery ?\n\nThanks,
If you did not see with your 'eyes' freedom of religion you\nmust ne at least blind !\n2 weeks ago I read the interview of a Turkish journalist in a GReek magazine,\nhe said nothing about being forbiden to have Turkish press in Greece !\nGive as a brake. You call athnic cleansing of apopulation when it doubles?\nWhat do you mean by that ? Anyway in Greece, as in every  country if you want\nsome property you 'inform' the goverment .\nWell well well. When Turkish in Area of Komotini elect 1 out of 3\nrepresenatives of this area to GReek parliament, if not freedom what is it?\n3 out of 3 ? Maybe there are only Turks living there ....\nI cannot deny that actions of fanatics from both sides were reported.\nA minority of Greek idiots indeed attack religious places, which\nwere protected by the Greek police. Photographs of Greek policemen \npreventing Turks from this non brain minority were all over Greek press.
This has been discussed before, by several people, on this net.  The\nstatement is attributable either to Hajj Amin al-Husseini, former Grand\nMufti of Jerusalem - and the leader of the Palestinian death squads\nduring the 1948 war, or to one of his chief henchmen.  \n\nIt was not coined by B'nai B'rith or, for that matter, any Jewish\norganization.

Preliminary reports were presented at the\n1986, 1988, and 1989 meetings of the Society for Psychophysiological Research".\n\nDonchin happens to be an Israeli.\n\nDo you really think that Israel needs something as primitive as torture when it\nhas THIS as well as something brought over by a Russian mathematician from the\nLenningrad Military Hospital in 1979  (factor-analysis of multiple unit\nactivity of the brain) ???  Surely you jest.\n\nWhen Israel sics trained dogs on Arab prisoners the way it's commonly done on\nprison farms in Mississippi or Alabama, *then* you have a right to protest\nagainst torture. When Israeli security personnel beat Arab prisoners the way\nChicago police do, *then* you have a right to complain.

On the 10th I had got my crew, done the paper-\nwork, and left for the Zhdanov District. That's in Azerbaijan, near the\nNagorno Karabagh region.\n\nAfter the 14th, rumors started to the effect that in Karabagh, specifically\nin Stepanakert, an uprising had taken place. They said "uprising" in\nAzerbaijani, but I don't think it was really an uprising, just a \ndemonstration. After that the unrest started. Several Armenians living in the \nZhdanov District were injured. How were they injured? They were beaten, even \nwomen; it was said that they were at the demonstrations, but they live here, \nand went from here to Karabagh to demonstrate. After that I felt uneasy. There\nwere some conversations about Armenians among the local population: the\nArmenians had done this, the Armenians had done that. Right there at the site.\nI was attacked a couple of times by kids. Well true, the guys from my crew \nwouldn't let them come at me with cables and knives. After that I felt really \nbad. I didn't know where to go. I up and called home. And my children tell me,\n"There's unrest everywhere, be careful." Well I had a project going on. I told\nthe Second Secretary of the District Party Committee what had been going on \nand said I wanted to take my crew off the site. They wouldn't allow it, they \nsaid, "Nothing's going to happen to you, we've entrusted the matter to the \npolice, we've warned everyone in the district, nothing will happen to you." \nWell, in fact they did especially detail us a policeman to look after me, he \nknows all the local people and would protect me if something happened. This\nman didn't leave me alone for five minutes: he was at work the whole time and \nafterward he spent the night with us, too.\n\nI sense some disquiet and call home; my wife also tells me, "The situation is\nvery tense, be careful."\n\nWe finished the job at the site, and I left for Sumgait first thing on the\nmorning of the 29th. When we left the guys warned me, they told me that I\nshouldn't tell anyone on the way that I was an Armenian. I took someone else's\nbusiness travel documents, in the name of Zardali, and hid my own. I hid it \nand my passport in my socks. We set out for Baku. Our guys were on the bus, \nthey sat behind, and I sat up front. In Baku they had come to me and said that\nthey had to collect all of our travel documents just in case. As it turns out \nthey knew what was happening in Sumgait.\n\nI arrive at the bus station and there they tell me that the city of Sumgait is\nclosed, there is no way to get there. That the city is closed off and the \nbuses aren't running. Buses normally leave Baku for Sumgait almost every two\nminutes. And suddenly--no buses. Well, we tried to get there via private\ndrivers. One man, an Azerbaijani, said, "Let's go find some other way to get\nthere." They found a light transport vehicle and arranged for the driver to\ntake us to Sumgait.\n\nHe took us there. But the others had said, "I wouldn't go if you gave me a\nthousand rubles." "Why?" "Because they're burning the city and killing the\nArmenians. There isn't an Armenian left." Well I got hold of myself so I could\nstill stand up. So we squared it away, the four of us got in the car, and we \nset off for Sumgait. On the way the driver says, "In fact there aren't any\nArmenians left. 'They burned them all, beat them all, and stabbed them." Well \nI was silent. The whole way--20-odd miles--I was silent. The driver asks me, \n"How old are you, old man?" He wants to know: if I'm being that quiet, not \nsaying anything, maybe it means I'm an Armenian. "How old are you?" he asks \nme. I say, "I'm 47." "I'm 47 too, but I call you 'old man'." I say, "It \ndepends on God, each person's life in this world is different." I look much\nolder than my years, that's why he called me old man. Well after that he was\nsilent, too.\n\nWe're approaching the city, I look and see tanks all around, and a cordon.\nBefore we get to the Kavkaz store the driver starts to wave his hand. Well, he\nwas waving his hand, we all start waving our hands. I'm sitting there with\nthem, I start waving my hand, too. I realized that this was a sign that meant\nthere were no Armenians with us.\n\nI look at the city--there is a crowd of people walking down the middle of the \nstreet, you know, and there's no traffic. Well probably I was scared. They\nstopped our car. People were standing on the sidewalks. They have armature \nshafts, and stones . . . And they stopped us . . .\n\nAlong the way the driver tells us how they know who's an Armenian and who's \nnot. The Armenians usually . . . For example, I'm an Armenian, but I speak \ntheir language very well. Well Armenians usually pronounce the Azeri word for \n"nut," or "little nut," as "pundukh," but "fundukh" is actually correct. The \npronunciations are different. Anyone who says "pundukh," even if they're not \nArmenian, they immediately take out and start to slash. Another one says, \n"There was a car there, with five people inside it," he says. "They started \nhitting the side of it with an axe and lit it on fire. And they didn't let the\npeople out," he says, "they wouldn't let them get out of the car." I only saw \nthe car, but the driver says that he saw everything. Well he often drives from\nBaku to Sumgait and back . . .\n\nWhen they stop us we all get out of the car. I look and there's a short guy,\nhis eyes are gleaming, he has an armature shaft in one hand and a stone in\nthe other and asks the guys what nationality they are one by one. "We're\nAzerbaijani,' they tell him, 'no Armenians here." He did come up to me when \nwe were pulling our things out and says, "Maybe you're an Armenian, old man?" \nBut in Azerbaijani I say, "You should be ashamed of yourself!" And . . . he \nleft. Turned and left. That was all that happened. What was I to do? I had \nto . . . the city was on fire, but I had to steal my children out of my own \nhome.\n\nThey stopped us at the entrance to Mir Street, that's where the Kavkaz store \nand three large, 12-story buildings are. That's the beginning of down-town. I \nsaw that burned automobile there, completely burned, only metal remained. I \ncouldn't figure out if it was a Zhiguli or a Zaporozhets. Later I was told it \nwas a Zhiguli. And the people in there were completely incinerated. Nothing \nremained of them, not even any traces. That driver had told me about it, and I\nsaw the car myself. The car was there. The skeleton, a metallic carcass. About\n30 to 40 yards from the Kavkaz store.\n\nI see a military transport, an armored personnel carrier. The hatches are\nclosed. And people are throwing armature shafts and pieces of iron at it, the\ncrowd is. And I hear shots, not automatic fire, it's true, but pistol shots.\nSeveral shots. There were Azerbaijanis crowded around that personnel carrier. \nSomeone in the crowd was shooting. Apparently they either wanted to kill the \nsoldiers or get a machine gun or something. At that point there was only one \narmored personnel carrier. And all the tanks were outside the city, cordoning \noff Sumgait.\n\nI walked on. I see two Azerbaijanis going home from the plant. I can tell by \ntheir gait that they're not bandits, they're just people, walking home. I\njoined them so in case something happened, in case someone came up to us\nand asked questions, either of us would be in a position to answer, you see.\nBut I avoided the large groups because I'm a local and might be quickly \nrecognized. I tried to keep at a distance, and walked where there were fewer\npeople. Well so I walked into Microdistrict 2, which is across from our block.\nI can't get into our block, but I walked where there were fewer people, so as \nto get around. Well there I see a tall guy and 25 to 30 people are walking \nbehind him. And he's shouting into a megaphone: "Comrades, the Armenian-\nAzerbaijani war has begun!"\n\nThe police have megaphones like that. So they're talking and walking around \nthe second microdistrict. I see that they're coming my way, and turn off \nbehind a building. I noticed that they walked around the outside buildings, \nand inside the microdistricts there were about 5 or 6 people standing on every\ncorner, and at the middles of the buildings, and at the edges. What they were \ndoing I can't say, because I couldn't get up close to them, I was afraid. But \nthe most important thing was to get away from there, to get home, and at least\nfind out if my children were alive or not . . .\n\n   April 20, 1988\n   Yerevan\n\n		     - - - reference - - -\n\n[1] _The Sumgait Tragedy; Pogroms against Armenians in Soviet Azerbaijan,\n    Volume I, Eyewitness Accounts_, edited by Samuel Shahmuradian, forward by\n    Yelena Bonner, 1990, published by Aristide D.

Pardon me Tim, but I do not see how it can be possible for the IDF to fail\nto detect the presence of those responsible for planting the bomb which\nkilled the three IDF troops and then later know the exact number and \nwhereabouts of all of them. Several villages were shelled. How could the IDF\npossibly have known that there were guerrillas in each of the targetted\nvillages? You see, it was an arbitrary act of "retaliation".\n\n\n\nThe problem, Tim, is that the original reason for the invasion was Palestinian\nattacks on Israel, NOT Lebanese attacks. \n\n\nFirst, I believe that my statement applies to both sides.\n\nHaving said that, I think it is neccessary to separate what is legitimately\nnegotiable and what is not. For example, no country has the right to abuse\none's human rights. Deciding whether there will be one or two states in\nPalestine is a legitimate question. While de facto one state exists, Israel \nmust treat all within its domain equitably.\n\n\nYes, I am afraid that what you say is true but that still does not justify\noccupying your neighbor's land. Israel must resolve its disputes with the\nnative Palestinians if it wants peace from such attacks.\n\n\nNot true. Lebanese were not attacking Israel in the 1970s. With a strong\nLebanese government (free from Syrian and Israeli interference) I believe\nthat the border could be adequately patrolled. The Palestinian heavy\nweapons have been siezed in past years and I do not see as significant a\nthreat as once existed.

I'll \nsee if I can get our dear "Mehmetcik" to write you a letter giving\nyou and your criminal handlers at the ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and\nRevisionism Triangle some military pointers, like how to shoot armed\nadult males instead of small Muslim children and pregnant women.\n\n\nSource: 'The Times,' 3 March 1992\n\nMASSACRE UNCOVERED....\n\nBy ANATOL LIEVEN,\n\nMore than sixty bodies, including those of women and children, have \nbeen spotted on hillsides in Nagorno-Karabakh, confirming claims \nthat Armenian troops massacred Azeri refugees. Hundreds are missing.\n\nScattered amid the withered grass and bushes along a small valley \nand across the hillside beyond are the bodies of last Wednesday's \nmassacre by Armenian forces of Azerbaijani refugees.\n\nFrom that hill can be seen both the Armenian-controlled town of \nAskeran and the outskirts of the Azerbaijani military headquarters \nof Agdam. Those who died very nearly made it to the safety of their \nown lines.\n\nWe landed at this spot by helicopter yesterday afternoon as the last \ntroops of the Commonwealth of Independent states began pulling out. \nThey left unhindered by the warring factions as General Boris Gromov, \nwho oversaw the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan, flew to Stepanakert \nto ease their departure.\n\nA local truce was enforced to allow the Azerbaijaines to collect their \ndead and any refugees still hiding in the hills and forest. All the \nsame, two attack helicopters circled continuously the nearby Armenian \npositions.\n\nIn all, 31 bodies could be counted at the scene. At least another \n31 have been taken into Agdam over the past five days.

Well, if you put things into historical perspective, the Turks\n moved into an area, which was inhabited by Greeks.  This is how the history\n between the two nations started some centuries ago.  Since then, it has been\n a continuous battle between the two nations.  From my perspective I can't see\n why I should say that Greeks have been responsible for what has happened \n between the two nations.  Of course, it would not be reasonable to argue that\n the hostility should drag till we kick the Turks out of this area.  This isn't\n going to happen, so the best would be to improve the relations between the two\n countries.  A golden oportunity exists with Cyprus.  If things can't work\n there, there isn't any possible way that could work between our nations.\n\n\n I always avoid to discuss such things.  I consider it a waist of my time.\n Besides, as I said, I do not want to open a new flame.\n\n\n I thought it was a smart move to receive more money from Greek tourists.\n I bet that this week there should be about 200,000 tourists from Greece\n in Turkey.  Each one will leave at least $1,000 so go and figure what this\n means to your economy.  If you had kept the visa requirement, how many\n Greeks would bother to visit Turkey?\n\n\n Come on. Do not extrapolate from your limited personal experience.  You err\n if you think you'd get a reasonable conclusion.

Sorry, ARF - you dog,\n\nThat news was suppressed because the Israeli national volleyball team\nrepeatedly spiked it.\n\nLet this be a lesson to others not to invoke the wrath of sports nuts.\n(Brits lead the way in this regard, with ~220 casualties in the last 2\nyears.)\n\nAnyway, Yigal would never sue.  His life is (presumably) so pristine\nthat its most intimate details could be revealed without harm to\nanyone.  Might even be good instruction for some people I can think of.
This post has all the earmarks of a form program, where the user types in\n   a nationality or ethnicity and it fills it in in certain places in the story. \n   If this is true, I condemn it. If it's a fabrication, then the posters have\n   horrible morals and should be despised by everyone on tpm who values truth.\n\n   Jesse\n\nAgreed.
Are you suggesting that we should forget the cold-blooded genocide of\n2.5 million Muslim people by the Armenians between 1914 and 1920? But \nmost people aren't aware that in 1939 Hitler said that he would pattern\nhis elimination of the Jews based upon what the Armenians did to Turkish\npeople in 1914.\n\n\n     'After all, who remembers today the extermination of the Tartars?'\n      (Adolf Hitler, August 22, 1939: Ruth W. Rosenbaum (Durusoy), \n          "The Turkish Holocaust - Turk Soykirimi", p. 213.)\n\n\nI refer to the Turks and Kurds as history's forgotten people. It does\nnot serve our society well when most people are totally unaware of\nwhat happened in 1914 where a vicious society, run by fascist Armenians,\ndecided to simply use the phoniest of pretexts as an excuse, for wiping \nout a peace-loving, industrious, and very intelligent and productive \nethnic group. What we have is a demand from the fascist government of\nx-Soviet Armenia to redress the wrongs that were done against our\npeople. And the only way we can do that is if we can catch hold of and \nnot lose sight of the historical precedence in this very century. We \ncannot reverse the events of the past, but we can and we must strive to \nkeep the memory of this tragedy alive on this side of the Atlantic, so as\nto help prevent a recurrence of the extermination of a people because \nof their religion or their race. Which means that I support the claims \nof the Turks and Kurds to return to their lands in x-Soviet Armenia, \nto determine their own future as a nation in their own homeland.\n\nSerdar Argic
From: Center for Policy Research <cpr>\nSubject: rejoinder. Questions to Israelis\n\n\nTo:  shaig@Think.COM\n\nSubject: Ten questions to Israelis\n\nDear Shai,\n\nYour answers to my questions are unsatisfactory.\n\nIn the answer to my first question, concerning the nonexistence of\nIsraeli nationality, your answer conflicts with information I have\nreceived from other quarters, according to which there are two\ndistinct categories of classifying Israelis:  Citizenship\n(Ezrahut) and Nationality (Le'um). The former is used on passports\netc, and the later for daily identification in Israeli society. I\nam told that people in Israel have to carry their ID cards at all\ntimes and present them at many public places, almost every day.\nThese ID cards make clear who the holder is, a Jew or an Arab.\nYou maintain that this mainly because of religious services\nprovided. But do you really believe that this is the reason ?\nCould you provide evidence that this is the case and that it\nserves no other purpose ?\n\nIn the answer to my second questions, concerning the fact that\nIsrael has no fixed borders, you state that Israel's borders were\n'shaped and reshaped by both war and peace'. According to what I\nread, the first Zionists in the beginning of the Century, had\nplans for the Jewish State to extend into what is Lebanon and into\nTransjordan (Jordan). I also read that it was the express wish of\nBen-Gurion to not declare Israel's borders, when Israel was\nestablished, as this might restrict Israel's opportunities for\nlater expansion. Israel often claims it right of existence on the\nfact that Jews lived there 2000 years ago or that God promised the\nland to them. But according to biblical sources, the area God\npromised would extend all the way to Iraq. And what were the\nborders in biblical times which Israel considers proper to use\ntoday ?  Finally, if Israel wants peace, why can't it declare what\nit considers its legitimate and secure borders, which might be a\nbase for negotiations? Having all the above facts in mind, one\ncannot blame Arab countries to fear Israeli expansionism, as a\nnumber of wars have proved (1948, 1956, 1967, 1982).\n\nYour answer to my third question is typical of a Stalinist public\nofficial. I don't think your answer is honest.  You refer me to\nVanunu's revelations about Israel's nuclear arsenal without\nevaluating the truthfullness of his revelations. Now if he said\nthe truth, then why should he been punished, and if he lied, why\nshould he be punished? I would appreciate more honesty.\n\nSomebody provided an answer to the fourth question, concerning\n'hidden prisoners' in Israeli prisons. He posted an article from\nMa'ariv documenting such cases.  It seems that such prisoners do\nexist in Israel. What do you think about that ?\n\nYou imply that my questions show bias and are formulated in such a\nway to 'cast aspersions upon Israel'. Such terms have often been\nused by the Soviet Union against dissidents: They call the Soviet\nUnion into disrepute. If my questions are not disturbing, they\nwould not call forth such hysterical answers. My questions are\nclearly provocative but they are meant to seek facts. I would be\nvery happy if you could convince me that what I am told about\nIsrael were just fabrications, but alas you have failed to do so.\nI suspect that you fear the truth and an open and honest\ndiscussion. This is a sign of weakness, not of strength.
Henrik (?),\n\nYour ignorance manifests itself in an awkward form of intransigence. I'm not\ngoing to spend time to review with you the recent history of Cyprus. If you are\nreally interested, I can provide you with a number of references on the issue.\nJust send me EMail for that.\n\n\nRelax! You're swinging fists into open air... I was *agreeing* with you,\nassuming that would be one of your points that you did not state! You may \nnot be very much used to it, to be agreed with - that is, but take it more\neasily.  !:-)\n  	\n\nNo, Henrik, believe me: You don't hope that.\n\n\nWas that after or before one French plane changed its route to avoid\ninspection??? \n\n--\nOnur Yalcin \noyalcin@iastate.edu
I'm not aware that the US government considers me dangerous.  In any\ncase, that has nothing to do with the current case.  The claim against\nthe ADL is that it illegally obtained and disseminated information that\nwas gathered by state and/or federal agencies in the course of their\nstandard interaction with citizens such as myself.  By that I refer to\nthings such as: address and phone number, vehicle registration and\nlicense information, photographs, etc.\n\n\nYou should ask the ADL, if you want an authoritative answer.  My guess\nis that they collected information on anyone who did or might engage in\npolitical criticism of Israel.  I further believe that they did this as\nagents of the Israeli government, or at least in agreement with them.\nAt least some of the information collected by the ADL was passed on to\nIsraeli officials.  In some cases it was used to influence, or attempt\nto influence, people's access to jobs or public forums.  These matters\nwill be brought out as the court case unfolds, since California law\nentitles people to compensation if such actions can be proven.  As my\nprevious posting shows, California law entitles people to compensation\neven in the absence of any specific consequences -- just for the further\ndissemination of certain types of private information about them.

I think he is trying to mislead people.  In cases where race\ninformation is sought, it is completely voluntary (the census\npossibly excepted).
Mr. Salah, why are you such a homicidal racist?  Do you feel this\nsame hatred towards Christans, or is it only Jews?  Are you from\na family of racists?  Did you learn this racism in your home?  Or\nare you a self-made bigot?  How does one become such a racist?  I\nwonder what you think your racism will accomplish.  Are you under\nthe impression that your racism will help bring peace in the mid-\neast?  I would like to know your thoughts on this.
...\n\nOf course you never read Arab media,\n\nI read Arab, ISRAELI (Jer. Post, and this network is more than enough)\nand Western (American, French, and British) reports and I can say\nthat if we give Israel -10 and Arabs +10 on the bias scale (of course\nyou can switch the polarities) Israeli newspapers will get either\na -9 or -10, American leading  newspapers and TV news range from -6\nto -10 (yes there are some that are more Israelis than Israelis)\nThe Montreal suburban (a local free newspaper) probably is closer\nto Kahane's views than some Israeli right wing newspapers, British\nrange from 0 (neutral) to -10, French (that Iknow of, of course) range\nfrom +2 (Afro-french magazines) to -10, Arab official media range from\n0 to -5 (Egyptian)  to +9 in SA. Why no +10? Because they do not want to\noverdo it and stir people against Israel and therefore against them since \nthey are doing nothing.\n\n \n\nthe average bias of what you read would be probably around -9,\nwhile that of the average American would be the same if they do\nnot read or read the new-york times and similar News-makers, and\n-8 if they read some other RELATIVELY less biased newspapers.
And we all know what an unbiased source the NYT is when it comes to things\nconcerning Israel.\n\nNeither the Times nor the trained seals who have responded thus far seem to\nrecognize the statement that these "private funds" were all tax exmpt.  In\notherwords, American taxpayers put up at least 30% of the money.  And\nfinalyy, how does "Federal land" mitigate the offensiveness of this alien\nmonument dedicated to perpetuating pitty and the continual flow of tax money\nto a foreign entity?
I only want to say that I agree with Noam on this point\nand I hope that all sides stop targeting civilians.
I lived there until July 1992 so I think that on the whole,\nmy input is relevant.\n\n\nThose are two separate questions.  Obviously, Israeli authorities do\nrecognize Israeli nationality for some purposes, e.g. passports,\nconsular services, etc...  ID cards have a field of nationality\nwhich is a subdivision of the above.  Ostensibly, this field\nis provided for sevices provided by the religious departments\nof the gov't, though this is not the general case.\n\n\nFrom its onset, Israel's borders have been shaped and reshaped by both\nwar and peace.  As such, the Israeli gov't has always felt that defining\nits borders is a step that is meaningful only after peace treaties have\nbeen conluded with its neighbors.  There is no plan for "ultimate borders"\n(is this a game like "ultimate frisbee"?) extending into  other countries.\n\n\nAside from what Vaanunu provided, no.\n\n\nIf that is true, then by virtue of the question's subject, it is\nunanswerable.  Anyone who claims its validity. is claiming an oxymoron.\nThat having been said, I deny the above.\n\nYou go on to ask quite a number of questions that show an obvious\nbias.  Questions of the sort "Is it true that you entered your\nmother's vagina?" which are based upon some kernel of truth, though\nphrased in a way as to render them repugnant and cast aspersions\nupon Israel.  Incidentally, the answer to the above is usually yes,\nunless you were born via a C-section.
Not exactly the same, but reminiscent of the assassination of Count\nBernadotte, who was _the_ UN negotiator during the 1948 Israeli war of\nindependence.  He was killed by the Israelis.  Seems he was being too\nsuccessful in negotiating a cease-fire, which would have worked\nterritorially against the nascent Israel, compared to continued war.
It's all my fault. \nI am in violation of one of my own rules:\n"Avoid FollowingUp to a Barf posting."\n\n\n\n\n\nThose damned, spiking Israelists, right, Barfling?\n\n\n"Trained Seals"?  You mean the ones that flap their flippers making\n"Arf, Arf!  Arf, Arf!" sounds?\n\n\nIn your own diseased mind, you now seem to believe that tax exemption\nis equivalent to government funding.  Holy Shit, Batman!  The US\ngovernment is now one of the major supporters of the Catholic Church\n--  in violation of the rules of separation of Church and State! \n\n\nQuick, Bill!  Commandeer all the churches and give them to the People!\nOr does your anti-logic only apply to the mosques belonging to what\nyou have described as "Ragheads" or perhaps the synagogues of those\nyou have characterized as "Hymies"?
In Re:Syria's Expansion, the author writes that the UN thought\nZionism was Racism and that they were wrong.  They were correct\nthe first time, Zionism is Racism and thankfully, the McGill Daily\n(the student newspaper at McGill) was proud enough to print an article\nsaying so.

Anyone who can repeate this choice piece of tripe without checking\nhis/her sources does not deserve to be believed.  The Gaza strip does\nnot possess the highest population density in the world.  In fact, it\nisn't even close.  Just one example will serve to illustrate the folly\nof this statement:  the city of Hong Kong has nearly ten times the\npopulation of the Gaza strip in a roughly comparable land area.  The\ncenters of numerous cities also possess comparable, if not far higher,\npopulation densities.  Examples include Manhattan Island (NY City), Sao\nPaolo, Ciudad de Mexico, Bombay,... \n\nNeed I go on?  The rest of Mr. Davidsson's message is no closer to the\ntruth than this oft-repeated statement is.
# \n# |> \n# |> |> |>    First, my above statement doesnot say that "the existence of israeli citizens\n# |> |> |>    in the WB revoke their right of life" but it says "the israeli occupation\n# |> |> |>    of the WB revoke the right of life for some/most its citizens - basically\n# |> |> |>    revokes the right of for its military men".

As far as\n  I can tell, you're proposing the following rules of engagement\n  between Israel and the Palestinean resistance.  Please feel\n  revise this preliminary draft as necessary:\n\n  1) Israeli military personnel are fair game at any time, in uniform\n     or out, on duty or off.  In practice, since any male or female\n     Israeli of military age (18-?) may be off-duty military, all but\n     young children are acceptable targets.  Since the existence of\n     Israel constitutes indication of hostile intent, no further\n     provocation is required.\n\n  2) To avoid inpermissable violations of the rights of non-combatant\n     Palestineans, Israeli forces must not engage Palestineans\n     without positive identification as military personnel, clear\n     indication of aggressive intent, and a clear field of fire.\n\n    a) Positive identification may be assured by either checking for\n       Palestinean military uniform, by posession of exclusively\n       military armament (ie, T78 MBTs or MiG-29 aircraft), or\n       self-identification (either verbal or documentary).  Note\n       that dual-use military/civilian weaponry such as hand grenades,\n       AK-47 rifles, and RPG launchers do not constitute positive\n       military identification and require closer inspection such\n       as document checks.\n\n    b) Aggressive intent (as distinct from merely 'hostile' intent,\n       which is the normal condition) may be assured by not less\n       than three rounds of incoming fire separated by intervals\n       of not less than ten seconds between rounds.  Note that a\n       single burst of automatic-weapon fire counds as one round,\n       as does a volley of rocket fire from more than one source.\n       As noted above, dual-use weaponry may NOT be assumed to\n       originate from military personnel, and thus do not justify\n       armed response.\n\n    c) A clear field of fire can be guaranteed by making a positive\n       military identification of all personnel in the target area of\n       the weapons to be used.  Note that aggressive intent need not\n       be proven for all possible targets.  Thus, if IAF aircraft\n       are attacked by a SAM crew it is not necessary to check the\n       papers of each crew member so long as none are obviously\n       civilians (as indicated, for instance, by the posession of\n       uniquely civilian weaponry such as stones, axes, and Molotov\n       coctails.)  Since it is often difficult for IAF elements to\n       land and make the necessary checks, ground forces should\n       first screen prospective strike areas before AGM fire.\n       For ACM purposes, a cockpit-to-cockpit pass within 5 meters\n       is usually sufficient for this purpose, but may be repeated\n       if necessary.
Was the article about zionism? or about something else. The majority\nof people I heard emitting this ignorant statement, do not really\nknow what zionism is.

I have one word for you LOSER!!!!
One of those US cases was John Pollard.
Contrary to what the "Protocols of Zion crowd" might suggest,\nJudaism does not have any such goals.\n\n\nThe question you ask is complicated and deserves an honest answer.\nI am going to provide one from my own current perspective, not a historical\none.  Currently, as a non-observant jew/Israeli/American, my own feeling\nis that Jews from the diaspora do not have a greater right in Palestine or\nIsrael, than the palestinians or Israelis (both arab and jew) do.\nWith regard to Jewish Israelis, they should have the same rights\nin Israel as do all other Israelis.\n\n\nWho are them?  If by them you mean the non-religious Jews, I think\nyou should be aware by now that the majority of the settlers and their\nsupporters are religious.  The other part of the problem is, to my\nknowledge, not that the palestinians don't want to be a part of Israel,\nas much as they would accept (for the most part) being full citizens\nof Israel, with all the priviliges and responsibilities accorded Israeli\ncitizens.  What they object to is the current limbo in which they find\nthemselves.
You definetly are in need of a shrink, loser!
Oh....I see...I didn't realize this...\n\n  I think that perhaps you should print flyers on this topic, and your\n  reasons for thinking the way you do. You should then distribute them\n  amongst the world's population. You see, I don't think there are many\n  people who are aware of this fact. Thank you for telling us the truth.\n\n  BTW: I would start by sending your flyers to each of the UN officials.\n	   Also, after you have distributed your flyers you might consider\n       hiding. You see, I think that once more people read what you think\n       they will have to lock you up in a mental institute; and don't think\n       they will ever let you out.\n \n  It is a strange strange world you live in.

The following flyer was distributed at AIPAC's 34th annual Policy Conference:
Today marks the 78th anniversary of the Armenian genocide of\n2.5 million Turks and Kurds in Eastern Anatolia and x-Soviet\nArmenia. The following letter, which represents a small portion \nof the full text, along with more than 200 pages of historical \ndocuments, scholarly sources, eyewitness accounts and photographs, \nwas sent to President Bill Clinton, members of Congress, editors, \nprogram directors and columnists of major newspapers, journals and \nradio/TV stations for the 78th anniversary of the Armenian genocide \nof 2.5 million Muslim people. On April 23 of every year, the people \nof Turkiye remember their dead. They grieve for lost family and the \nlost homes of their grandfathers. This year the Turkish Nation is \nmourning and praying again for her fallen heroes who gave their \nlives generously and with altruism, so that the future generations \nmay live on that anointed soil of the Turkish land happily and \nprosperously.\n\n------------------------- letter ----------------------------------\n\nDuring the years of World War I, the x-Soviet Armenian Government \nhas planned and perpetrated the 'Genocide' of the Muslim people, which \nnot only took the lives of 2.5 million Muslim people, but was also the \nmethod used to empty the Turkish homeland of its inhabitants. To this day, \nTurkish historic lands remain occupied by the x-Soviet Armenia. In order \nto cover up the fact of its usurpation of the historic Turkish homeland, \nwhich is the crux of Turkish political demands, fascist x-Soviet Armenia \ncontinues its anti-Turkish policy in the following ways:\n\n1. x-Soviet Armenia denies the historical fact of the Turkish Genocide\nin order to shift international public opinion away from its political\nresponsibility.\n\n2. x-Soviet Armenia, employing ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism \nTriangle, attempts to call into question the veracity of the Turkish \nGenocide.\n\n3. x-Soviet Armenia has also implemented state-sponsored terrorism through\nthe ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle in an attempt to \nsilence the Turkish people's vehement demands and protests.\n\n4. Using all its human, financial, and governmental resources, x-Soviet\nArmenia and its tools in the United States attempt to silence through\nterrorism, bribery and other subversive methods, non-Turkish supporters\nof the Turkish cause, be they political, governmental and humanitarian.\n\nUsing all the aforementioned methods, the x-Soviet Armenian Government \nis attempting to neutralize the international diplomatic community from\nmaking the Turkish Case a contemporary issue.\n\nYet despite the efforts of the x-Soviet Armenian Government and its \nterrorist and revisionist organizations, in the last decades, thanks \nto the struggle of those whose closest ones have been systematically \nexterminated by the Armenians, the international wall of silence on \nthis issue has begun to collapse, and consequently a number of \ngovernments and organizations have become supportive of the recognition \nof the Turkish Genocide.\n\nWith the full knowledge that the struggle for the Turkish territorial\ndemands are still in their initial stages, the Turkish and Kurdish people\nwill unflaggingly continue in this sacred struggle, therefore the victims\nof the Turkish Genocide demand:\n\n1. that the x-Soviet Armenian Government, as the heirs of the Armenian \nDictatorship, recognize the Turkish Genocide;\n\n2. that x-Soviet Armenia return the historic homeland to the Turkish and\nKurdish people;\n\n3. that the x-Soviet Armenian Government make material reparations for \ntheir heinous and unspeakable crime to the victims of the Turkish Genocide;\n\n4. that all world governments, and especially the United States, officially\nrecognize the Turkish Genocide and Turkish territorial rights and refuse\nto succumb to all Armenian political pressure;\n\n5. that the U.S. Government free itself from the friendly position it \nhas adopted towards its unreliable ally, x-Soviet Armenia, and officially \nrecognize the historical fact of the Turkish Genocide as well as be \nsupportive of the pursuit of Turkish territorial demands;\n\n6. that the x-Soviet Republics officially recognize the historical fact \nof the Turkish Genocide and include the cold-blooded extermination of \n2.5 million Muslim people in their history books.\n\nThe awareness of the Turkish people of the necessity of solidarity in the\nefforts to pursue the Turkish Cause is seen by the victims of the first \ngenocide of the 20th century as a positive step. Furthermore, a new \ngeneration has risen - equipped with a deep sense of commitment, politically\nmature and conscious, who determinedly pursue the Turkish Cause, through\nall necessary means, ranging from the political and diplomatic to the \narmed struggle. Therefore, the victims of the Turkish Genocide call upon\nall Muslims in the United States and Canada to participate vigorously in \nthe political, cultural and religious activities of the 78th Anniversary\nof the Armenian genocide of 2.5 million Muslim people.\n\n\nSerdar Argic
Anytime.\n\n\nSuffering from a severe case of myopia? No Muslim left alive - not a \nsingle one. Leading the first Armenian units who crossed the Ottoman \nborder in the company of the Russian invaders was the former Ottoman \nParliamentary representative for Erzurum, Karekin Pastirmaciyan, who \nassumed the revolutionary name Armen Garo. Another former Ottoman \nparliamentarian, Hamparsum Boyaciyan, led the Armenian guerrilla forces \nwho ravaged Turkish villages behind the lines under the nickname "Murad", \nespecially ordering that \n\n         'Kill Turks and Kurds wherever you find them and in \n          whatever circumstances you find them. Turkish children \n          also should be killed as they form a danger to the \n          Armenian nation.' (Hamparsum Boyadjian - 1914)[1]\n\n [1] M. Varandian, "History of the Dashnaktsutiun," p. 85.\n\nAnother former Member of Parliament, Papazyan, led the Armenian \nguerrilla forces that ravaged the areas of Van, Bitlis and Mush.\n\nIn March 1915, the Russian forces began to move toward Van. Immediately,\nin April 11, 1915 the Armenians of Van began a revolt, massacring all \nthe Turks in the vicinity so as to make possible its quick and easy \nconquest by Russians. Little wonder that Czar Nicholas II sent a \ntelegram of thanks to the Armenian Revolutionary Committee of Van in \nApril 21, 1915, "thanking it for its services to Russia." The Armenian \nnewspaper Gochnak, published in the United States, also proudly \nreported in May 24, 1915 that \n\n"only 1,500 Turks remained in Van the rest having been slaughtered."\n\nSource: Hovannisian, Richard G.: Armenia on the Road to Independence, 1918.\nUniversity of California Press (Berkeley and Los Angeles), 1967, p. 13.\n\n"The addition of the Kars and Batum oblasts to the Empire increased the\n area of Transcaucasia to over 130,000 square miles. The estimated population\n of the entire region in 1886 was 4,700,000, of whom 940,000 (20 percent) were\n Armenian, 1,200,000 (25 percent) Georgian, and 2,220,000 (45 percent) Moslem.\n Of the latter group, 1,140,000 were Tatars. Paradoxically, barely one-third\n of Transcaucasia's Armenians lived in the Erevan guberniia, where the \n Christians constituted a majority in only three of the seven uezds. Erevan\n uezd, the administrative center of the province, had only 44,000 Armenians\n as compared to 68,000 Moslems. By the time of the Russian Census of 1897,\n however, the Armenians had established a scant majority, 53 percent, in the\n guberniia; it had risen by 1916 to 60 percent, or 670,000 of the 1,120,000\n inhabitants. This impressive change in the province's ethnic character \n notwithstanding, there was, on the eve of the creation of the Armenian \n Republic, a solid block of 370,000 Tartars who continued to dominate the \n southern districts, from the outskirts of Ereven to the border of Persia." \n (See also Map 1.

Some of the Tartars escaped of course. They \n found refuge in the mountains or succeeded in crossing the border \n into Turkey. The rest were killed.

The main legal principles of the Turkish State \nare summarized in Article 2 of the Constitution:\n\n	"The Republic of Turkey is a democratic, secular and social State\n	governed by the rule of law; bearing in mind the concepts of public\n	peace, national solidarity and justice; respecting human rights;\n	loyal to the nationalism of Ataturk, and based on the fundamental\n	tenets set forth in the Preamble of the Constitution."\n\nFreedom of culture and religion prevailed during the Ottoman Empire, allowing\nthe many nations and races within its boundaries to remain autonomous. The\nfact that the Ottoman Empire was the longest lived in recent history may be\nattributed to these freedoms, despite the lack of any written Constitution.\nThe first attempts to create a written Constitution occurred in 1839 and 1856.\nAlthough the documents adopted during these two attempts remained in force\nonly temporarily, they provided the basic elements of a Constitution.\n\nThe 1876 Constitution was the first legal document to force a Parliament and\nthe right of election to share the sovereignty of the Emperor. The Constitution\nof 1906 placed some additional limitations on the Emperor, while increasing\nthe power of the Parliament and the government.\n\nThe First World War (1914-1918) brought the Ottoman Empire to an end. By the\noccupation of Istanbul, the Parliament was dissolved and the Constitution was\nabolished. The members of Parliament were sent to exile to an island by the\noccupying forces.\n\nDuring the Independence War, the "Turkish Grand National Assembly" held their\nfirst meeting on April 23, 1920 to serve as the legislative body of the new\nTurkish state. This assembly prepared the new legal structure of the Turkish\nRepublic. The new Republic was proclaimed on October 29, 1923 and the new\nConstitution was adopted in 1924. That Constitution served as the legal \nbackbone of today's modern Turkish Republic. In 1945, Turkey adopted a \nmulti-party political system. The Constitution of 1924 was replaced by\nothers in 1961 and 1982. All three Constitutions of the Republic have been\nbased on the principles of parliamentary democracy, human rights, national\nsovereignty, division of powers, private ownership and secularization.\n\n"Major Principles of the Constitution"\n\nThe constitution (with 177 Articles) establishes the structure of the Republic\nwithin the following principles:\n\n- The Turkish Republic is a democratic, secular and social state governed by \n  law;\n- It should be governed to maintain public peace, national solidarity, justice,\n  human rights and the objectives of Ataturk;\n- The language of the State is Turkish;\n- Sovereignty is vested in the nation without any conditions or restrictions.\n  Sovereignty is exercised by organizations authorized by the nation;\n- Legislative power is carried by the Parliament elected by the nation. This\n  power cannot be delegated (transferred) to any one else;\n- Executive power is exercised by the President, and Council of Ministers;\n- Judicial power is exercised by the independent courts on behalf of the\n  Turkish nation;\n- All individuals are equal, irrespective of language, race, religion, color,\n  sex, or political beliefs;\n- Laws cannot be contradict those principles stated in the Constitution.\n\n"Structure of the State"\n\nIn accordance with the Constitution, the structure of the state is based on the\nprinciple of "division of power" to create a balanced and self-controlled\nsystem. The power is divided into "legislative power," "executive power," and\n"judicial power," balanced to secure freedoms and powers to control each\nother (self-control).\n\n A. Legislative Power:\n\n The "Turkish Grand National Assembly" is a parliament with one House, elected\n by the nation for a term of five years to exercise legislative power on\n behalf of the nation. The basic functions of this Assembly are:\n\n - to adopt, to amend, or to repeal laws;\n - to approve or to dismiss the Council of Ministers;\n - to supervise and to question Ministers or the Council of Ministers;\n - to debate, to amend and to approve annual budgets;\n - to ratify international agreements;\n - to grant amnesty or pardons.\n\n Members of Parliament do not have any liability for their words (either oral\n or written) during the course of their legislative duties. The country is\n divided into constituencies. The number of representatives of each is\n calculated according to its population. Every Turkish citizen over the age\n of twenty-one can vote.\n\n Elections are supervised by the "Supreme Council of Elections," which solves\n all disputes or appeals. In each province, the local "Board of Election"\n runs and controls the election under the supervision and guidelines of the\n Supreme Council. Members of the Council and Boards are elected among \n independent judges.\n\n B. Executive Power:\n\n The President of the Republic is the Head of State (not the head of government\n as in the Unites States). The main functions of the President are:\n\n - to represent the State and the Country;\n - to insure the implementation of the Constitution;\n - to coordinate legislative, judicial and executive functions;\n - act as the Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces;\n - to ratify laws and government decrees.\n \n The President is elected by the Grand National Assembly for a period of seven\n years. The President may ratify or return the laws for a second debate, may \n call for a referendum.\n\n Executive power is exercised by the "Council of Ministers," headed by the\n Prime Minister. The Prime Minister is appointed by the President from the\n members of Parliament. The Prime Minister names the Ministers for approval\n by the President. The new Government (Council of Ministers) reads their\n program at the Parliament and the vote of confidence follows. There are 21 (?)\n Ministers in the Council.\n\n Ministers and other members of the administration can be sued in independent\n "administrative" courts for their misuse of power, administrative errors or\n functions against any law.\n\n C. Judicial Power:\n\n Judicial power is exercised by independent courts. No authority or power can\n instruct the judges or public prosecutors of the courts. These cannot be \n discharged, replaced or retired by executive authorities except for the\n reasons clearly stated by the appropriate laws. There are three categories\n of courts in the Turkish judiciary system:\n\n - Courts of justice deal with legal, commercial and criminal cases. The \n   decisions of these courts may be reviewed by the supreme court of justice\n   upon the appeal of the parties involved.\n - The decisions or functions of the executive power (including the Prime\n   Minister and Ministers or any governmental department) can be appealed in\n   administrative courts if these functions or decisions are against the law.\n   The decisions of these administrative courts may also be reviewed by the\n   high administrative court.\n\n The laws and decisions of the Grand National Assembly can be examined by the\n "Constitutional Court" if they contradict the Constitution. If found\n contradictory, this court may cancel the decisions or laws of the Parliament.\n\n\nSerdar Argic
From Israeline 4/14\n\nToday's MA'ARIV reports that yesterday, following Egyptian\nPresident Hosni Mubarak's meeting with PLO Chief Yasser Arafat and\nprominent Palestinian Faisal al-Husseini, the latter said that in\nprinciple, the Palestinians have decided to participate in the\npeace talks.

The\nnewspaper also reports that threatening phone calls were recently\nmade to houses of several of the senior members of the Palestinian\ndelegation to the peace talks. The threats, in Arabic, demanded\nthat the delegates not go to Washington to, "sell out the\nPalestinian people."

There have been a number of articles on the PBS frontline program\nabout Iranian bomb. Here is my $0.02 on this and related subjects.\n\nOne is curious to know the real reasons behind this and related\npublic relations campaign about Iran in recent months. These include:\n\n1) Attempts to implicate Iran in the bombing of the New York Trade\n   Center. Despite great efforts in this direction they have not\n   succeeded in this. They, however, have indirectly created\n   the impression that Iran is behind the rise of fundamentalist\n   Islamic movements and thus are indirectly implicated in this matter.\n\n2) Public statements by the Secretary of State Christoffer and\n   other official sources regarding Iran being a terrorist and\n   outlaw state.\n\n3) And finally the recent broadcast of the Frontline program. I \n   suspect that this PR campaign against Iran will continue and\n   perhaps intensify.\n\nWhy this increased pressure on Iran? A number of factors may have\nbeen behind this. These include:\n\n1) The rise of Islamic movements in North-Africa and radical\n   Hamas movement in the Israeli occupied territories. This\n   movement is basically anti-western and is not necessarily\n   fueled by Iran. The cause for accelerated pace of this \n   movement is probably the Gulf War which sought to return\n   colonial Shieks and Amirs to their throne in the name of\n   democracy and freedom. Also, the obvious support of Algerian\n   military coup against the democratically elected Algerian\n   Islamic Front which clearly exposed the democracy myth.\n   A further cause of this may be the daily broadcast of the news\n   on the slaughter of Bosnian Moslems.\n\n2) Possible future implications of this movement in Saudi Arabia\n   and other US client states and endangerment of the cheap oil\n   sources from this region.\n\n3) A need to create an enemy as an excuse for huge defense\n   expenditures. This has become necessary after the demise of\n   Soveit Union.\n\nThe recent PR campaign against Iran, however, seems to be directed\nfrom Israel rather than Washington. There is no fundamental conflict\nof interest between Iran and the US and in my opinion, it is in the\ninterest of both countries to affect reestablishment of normal\nand friendly relations. This may have a moderating effect on the\nrise of radical movements within the Islamic world and Iran .
How about Jews who were expelled from their homelands in Iraq, Syria,\nJordan, Algeria, etc.?  Don't they deserve justice, too?\n\n\nWhy is your criticism ALWAYS directed against Israel, but never\nagainst the Arab states, even when they are so much more guilty of the\naccusations you make?  Is it because you now call yourself a\nPalestinean? \n\n\nThis is why the "land-for-peace" formula is so foolish.  Land-for-land\nor peace-for-peace seems much more just, except that it would cost the\nArabs something and so is not under consideration.  \n\nLet's not forget that about half of Israel's population are refugees\nfrom Arab countries.  Somehow, THEIR land now being occupied by Arab\nstates and THEIR homes now being lived-in by Arab people are not\nincluded in any negotiations.  Is this your prescription for peace? \n\n\nAgain, you've somehow managed to overlook the fact that the Arab\nstates are much more restrictive on these points.  In fact, the\nofficially Judenrein policies of almost all of the Arab states makes\nthem resemble Nazi Germany chillingly closely.\n\n\nThere are many states in which Christians can live happily, many which\nhave official religions and Christian majorities and Christian-based\nlaws.  There are some 2 dozen Arab and Islamic states.  There is only\n1 (one) Jewish state.  Do you have a problem with this?  Is this one\nJewish state too many?  There are others who might agree with you, you\nknow. \n\n\nHave you just arrived on tpm recently???  Again, the supporters of the\nArab and Islamic camps are frequently and massively guilty of\n"emotional, infantile outbursts" which have weakened their positions\ndramatically.  Somehow, your criticisms are very one-sided and\nsimple-minded. \n\nP.S. How's the Fund coming along?
This is nonsense. I lived in the Negev for many years and I can say\nfor sure that no Beduins were "moved" or harmed in any way. On the\ncontrary, their standard of living has climbed sharply; many of them\nnow live in rather nice, permanent houses, and own cars. There are\nquite a few Beduin students in the Ben-Gurion university.

The theory is that the hollering kills the spirit of the criminal/Nazi \nArmenians of the ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle. \nNow, try dealing with the rest of what I wrote.\n\nWhat is more, the activities of the Armenian Government seem to have been\nefforts aimed at eradicating a race (the Turks) or aimed at carrying out a\none-sided feud, instead of being a struggle for liberation. From the outset,\nthe efforts of the Armenian revolutionaries within the Ottoman borders took\nthe form of terrorist and destructive actions aimed at mass murder, cruelty\nand genocide, so that no other interpretation of them is possible. Armenian\nactivities started during the reign of Abdulhamid II as individual acts of\nterror, and then developed into assassinations and surprise attacks. The element\nof brute force in these activities increased steadily, culminating in mass\nrebellions and widespread fighting during the First World War. Furthermore,\nwhen the Ottoman army withdrew from Eastern Anatolia after the 1915 Sarikamis\ndefeat, Armenian revolutionaries initiated a series of cruelties in this area.\nAlthough the Russians occupied Eastern Anatolia as an enemy, nevertheless they\nwere constrained by the rules of war. However, when they returned to their\ncountry in 1917 after the Revolution, Armenian revolutionaries were unchecked\nin this area for about a year until the Ottoman forces returned to Erzurum\nin 1918. During this period, Armenian revolutionaries executed massacres on\nthe local people which is recorded in historical documents.[1]\n\nFor example, let us look at a report dated 21 March 1918 which the Commander\nof the Third Army submitted when he entered Erzurum and Erzincan: \n\n "They were completely and systematically destroyed and burned down \n  by Armenians, even the trees were cut down, and they are like a \n  building entirely consumed by fire in every sense of the word." \n\nAs for the people who had been living in Erzurum and Erzincan:\n\n"Those who were capable of fighting were taken away at the very beginning\n with the excuse of forced labor in road construction, they were taken\n in the direction of Sarikamis and annihilated. When the Russian army\n withdrew, a part of the remaining people was destroyed in Armenian\n massacres and cruelties: they were thrown into wells, they were locked\n in houses and burned down, they were killed with bayonets and swords, in places\n selected as butchering spots, their bellies were torn open, their lungs\n were pulled out, and girls and women were hanged by their hair after\n being subjected to every conceivable abominable act. A very small part \n of the people who were spared these abominations far worse than the\n cruelty of the inquisition resembled living dead and were suffering\n from temporary insanity because of the dire poverty they had lived\n in and because of the frightful experiences they had been subjected to.\n Including women and children, such persons discovered so far do not\n exceed one thousand five hundred in Erzincan and thirty thousand in\n Erzurum. All the fields in Erzincan and Erzurum are untilled, everything\n that the people had has been taken away from them, and we found them\n in a destitute situation. At the present time, the people are subsisting\n on some food they obtained, impelled by starvation, from Russian storages\n left behind after their occupation of this area."[2]\n \nForeign observers who witnessed the events, including Russian Officers\nwho did not desert their lines, submitted detailed reports proving the\ngenocide to Ottoman commanders who received them as prisoners of war.\nWhat is most important is that they stated in their reports 'the \nmassacres did not happen by chance but were planned.'[3]\n\nAt the end of the war, the German author Dr. Weiss, his Austrian colleague\nDr. Stein and his Turkish colleague Mr. Ahmet Vefik visited Trabzon, Kars,\nErzurum and Batum between April 17th and May 20th 1918 to record the\ncruelties. Their writings not only show the scope of Armenian activities,\nbut also reveal their goal and true nature.[4]\n\n[1] (The Ottoman State, the Ministry of War), "Islam Ahalinin Ducar Olduklari\n    Mezalim Hakkinda Vesaike Mustenid Malumat," (Istanbul, 1918).

I have just started reading the articles in this news\ngroup. There seems to be an attempt by some members to quiet\nother members with scare tactics. I believe one posting said\nthat all postings by one person are being forwarded to his\nserver who keeps a file on him in hope that "Appropriate action\nmight be taken". \n	I don't know where you guys are from but in America\nsuch attempts to curtail someones first amendment rights are\nnot appreciated. Here, we let everyone speak their mind\nregardless of how we feel about it. Take your fascistic\nrepressive ideals back to where you came from.
What are you, retarded?
Is there any Israeli a civilian, in your opinion ?\n\nNow, I do not condone myself bombing villages, any kind of villages.\nBut you claim these are villages with civilians, and Iraelis claim they are \ncamps filled with terrorists. You claim that israelis shell the villages with the\n'hope' of finding a terrorist or so. If they kill one, fine, if not, too bad, \ncivilians die, right ? I am not so sure. \n\nAs somebody wrote, Saddam Hussein had no problems using civilians in disgusting\nmanner. And he also claimed 'civilians murdered'. Let me ask you, isn't there \nat least a slight chance that you (not only, and the question is very general, \nno insult) are doing a similar type of propaganda in respect to civilians in\nsouthern Lebanon ?\n\nNow, a lot people who post here consider 'Israeli soil' kind of Mediteranean sea.\nHow do you define Israeli soil ? From what you say, if you do not clearly \nrecognize the state of Israel, you condone killing israelis anywhere.\n\n\nI do not know what was the pupose of the action you describe. If it was \nto kill civilians (I doubt), I certainly DO NOT CONDONE IT. If civilians were \nkilled, i do not condone it. \n\n\n\n\n\nMr. Hernlem, it was YOU, not ME, who was showing a huge satisfaction for 3 \nisraelis (human beings by most standards, Don't know about your standards) killed.\n\nIf you ask me those questions, I will have no problem answering (not with a \nquestion, as you did) : No, NOBODY is qualified candidate for murder, nothing\njustifies murder. I have the feeling that you may be able yourself to make\nsimilar statements, maybe after eliminating all Israelis, jews, ? Am I wrong ?\n\n\nNow tell me, did you also condone Saddam's scuds on israeli 'soldiers' in, let's\nsay, Tel Aviv ? From what I understand, a lot of palestineans cheered. What does\nit show? It does not qualify for freedom fighting to me ? But again, I may be \nwrong, and the jewish controlled media distorted the information, and I am just\nan ignorant victim of the media, like most of us.

I'am arguing about \n: the Armenian-Nazi colaboration during World War II. Any comment?\n\n\nIt could be, perhaps, your head wasn't screwed on just right. In 1941, \nwhile the Jews were being assembled for their doom in the Nazi concentration \ncamps, the Armenian volunteers in Germany formed the first Armenian \nbattalion to fight alongside the Nazis. In 1943, this battalion had \ngrown into eight battalions of 20,000-strong under the command of the\nformer guerilla leader Dro (the butcher), who was the former dictator of the\nshort-lived Armenian Dictatorship (1918-1920) and the architect of the \ncold-blooded genocide of 2.5 million Turks and Kurds between 1914-1920.\nAn Armenian National Council was formed by the notorious Dashnak Party \nleaders in Berlin, which was recognized by the Nazis. Encouraged by \nthis, the Armenians summarily formed a provisional government that endorsed \nand espoused fully the principles of the Nazis and declared themselves as the \nmembers of the Aryan super race and full participants to Hitler's policy of \nextermination of the Jews.\n\nThis Armenian-Nazi conspiracy against the Jews during WWII was an "encore"\nperformance staged by the Armenians during WWI, when they back-stabbed and\nexterminated 2.5 million Turks by colluding with the invading Russian army.\n\nFurthermore, as McCarthy put it, the Armenian dictatorship was granted\na respite when the Ottomans admitted defeat and signed the Mudros\nArmistice with the Allies (October 30, 1918). The Allies had decided\nto create a Greater Armenia, including the old Russian province\nof Yerevan and adjoining areas, as well as most parts of Anatolia\nclaimed by the Armenian fanatics. Only the area called Cilicia\n(around the Ottoman province of Adana) was to be excluded, as it\nhad already been claimed by the French. The Allies quickly set\nabout attempting to disarm Ottoman soldiers and other Turks, who\ncould be expected to oppose their plans. \n\nOn April 19, 1919 the British Army occupied Kars, gave civilian\nand military power over to the Armenians, then withdrew. The British\nplanned for Kars to be included in the Armenian Dictatorship, even \nthough the Russian pre-war census had shown Kars Province to be over\n60% Muslim. The Turks of Kars were effectively disarmed, but the \nBritish could not disarm the Kurds of the mountains. The fate of\nthe Turks was almost an exact replica of what had occurred earlier\nin Eastern Anatolia. Murder, pillage, genocide and the destruction\nof Turkish homes and entire Turkish villages drove the Turks of\nKars to the mountains or south and west to the safety afforded\nby remaining units of the Ottoman Army. The British had left \nthe scene to the Armenian genocide squads. Therefore, few \nEuropeans were present to observe the genocide. One British\nsoldier, Colonel Rawlinson, who was assigned to supervise the\ndisarmament of Otoman soldiers, saw what was occurring. \n\nRawlinson wired to his superiors, \n\n"in the interest of humanity the Armenians should not be left in\n independent command of the Moslim population, as, their troops \n being without discipline and not being under effective control,\n atrocities were constantly being committed." \n\n\nCome again?\n\n: "These European Dashnags, with headquarters in Berlin, appealed to...\n\nWhy?\n\n: No wonder you are in such a mess.

And the 'Turkish Karabag' is next. As for 'Cyprus', In 1974, Turkiye \nstepped into Cyprus to preserve the lives of the Turkish population \nthere. This is nothing but a simple historical fact. Unfortunately, \nthe intervention was too late at least for some of the victims. Mass \ngraves containing numerous bodies of women and children already showed \nwhat fate had been planned for a peaceful minority.\n\nThe problems in Cyprus have their origin in decades of \noppression of the Turkish population by the Greek Cypriot \nofficials and their violation of the co-founder status of \nthe Turks set out in the constitution. The coup d'etat \nengineered by Greece in 1974 to execute a final solution \nto the Turkish problem was the savage blow that invoked \nTurkiye's intervention. Turkiye intervened reluctantly and \nonly as a last resort after exhausting all other avenues \nconsulting with Britain and Greece as the other two signatories \nto the treaty to protect the integrity of Cyprus. There simply \nwas not any expansionist motivation in the Turkish action at \nall. This is in dramatic contrast to the Greek motivation which \nwas openly expansionist, stated as 'Enosis,' union with Greece. \nSince the creation of independent Cyprus in 1960, the Turkish \npopulation, although smaller, legally had status as the co-founder\nof the republic with the Greek population.\n\nThe Greek Cypriots, with the support of 'Enosis'-minded\nGreeks in the mainland, have consistently ignored that\nstatus and portrayed the Island as a Greek island with\na minority population of Turks. The Turks of Cyprus are\nnot a minority in a Greek Republic and they found the\nonly way they could show that was to assert their \nautonomy in a separate republic.\n\nTurkiye is not satisfied with the status quo. She would\nrather not be involved with the island. But, given the\ndismal record of brutal Greek oppression of the Turkish\npopulation in Cyprus, she simply cannot leave the fate\nof the island's Turks in the hands of the Greeks until\nthe Turkish side is satisfied with whatever accord\nthe two communities finally reach to guarantee that\nhistory will not repeat itself to rob Turkish Cypriots\nof their rights, liberties and their very lives.\n\n\n  Source: 'Cyprus: The Tale Of An Island,' A.

In their names we demand justice.\n\nIn April 1915, the Turkish government began a systematically executed \nde-population of the eastern Anatolian homeland of the Armenians through a \ngenocidal extermination. This genocide was to insure that Turks exclusively\nruled over the geographic area today called the Republic of Turkey. The \nresult: 1.5 million murdered, 30 billion dollars of Armenian property stolen\nand plundered. This genocide ended nearly 3,000 years of Armenian civilization\non those lands. Today, the Turkish government continues to scrape clean any\nvestige of a prior Armenian existence on those lands. Today's Turkish\ngovernmental policy is to re-write the history of the era, to manufacture\ndistortion and generate excuses for their genocide of the Armenian people. In \nthe face of refutation ad nauseam, the Turkish Historical Society and cronies \nshamelessly continue to deny that any such genocide occurred. This policy \nmerely demonstrates that in the modern era, genocide is an effective state \npolicy when it remains un-redressed and un-punished. A crime unpunished is a \ncrime encouraged. Adolf Hitler took this cue less than 25 years after the \nsuccessful genocide of the Armenians.\n\nTurkey claims there was no systematic deportation of Armenians, yet...\nArmenians were removed from every city, town, and village in the whole of \nTurkey! Armenians who resisted deportation and massacre are referred to as \n"rebels".\n\nTurkey claims there was no genocide of the Armenians, yet...Turkish population\nfigures today show zero Armenians in eastern Turkey, the Armenian homeland.\n\nTurkey claims Armenians were always a small minority, yet...Turkey claims \nArmenians were a "threat".\n\nIn a final insult to the victims, the Republic of Turkey sold the bones of \napproximately 100,000 murdered Armenians for profit to Europe.\n\nToday, the Turkish government is enjoying the fruits of that genocide. The\nsuccess of this genocide is hangs over the heads of Turkey's Kurdish\npopulation.\n\nThe Armenians demand recognition, reparation, return of Armenian land and\nproperty lost as a result of this genocide.\n\nARMENIANS DEMAND JUSTICE                              ERMENILER ADALET ISTIYOR
Danhy,\n\nAs you think Bedouin will be surprised by the posted article, I\nwould be happy to have some feedback from Bedouin readers, if you\nwill. I cannot judge the accuracy of the article, but assumes that\nit is no fabrication. Any critical review would be helpful.
The Greeks did try to invade Cyprus just before the Turkish intervention: They\nfailed. Just for your info.
But what is Hasan B. Multu's middle name?  I'm not sure, but I heard\nit was "Bibo".  I also seem to recall that "Argic" is Azari for "bites\nthe wax Macedonian".\n\nWe don't have a mail address, but how about finding a snail address?\nThen instead of quashing Shergold rumors, we could just redirect them\n- Ahmed Cosar is a seven year old Greek boy with an incurable case of\ncrossposting.  His wish is to get into the Usenet Book of World\nRecords for having the highest noise to signal ratio.
Actually, this is incorrect.  French resistance may have played some\npart in hindering the German war effort, however the crucial role was\nsupplied on D-Day.\n\n\nInteresting statement.  Especially when you consider that Lebanon\nhad claimed to have made progress in the peace talks, as well as\nIsrael.  Of course, one of the prime obstacles to Israel's complete\nwithdrawal is the lack of governmental control that can be applied\nto the area as well as the large presence of Syrian forces which\nhave not been asked to withdraw as well.
Watch your language ASSHOLE!!!!
What gives Isreal the right to keep Jeruseleum?  It is the home of the muslim a\ns well as jewish religion, among others.  Heck, nobody ever mentions what Yitza\nk Shamir did forty or fifty years ago which is terrorize westerners much in the\n way Abdul Nidal does today.  Seems Isrealis are nowhere above Arabs, so theref\nore they have a right to Jerusaleum as much as Isreal does.
Very simple.\n\n"X-Soviet Armenian government must pay for their crime of genocide \n against 2.5 million Muslims by admitting to the crime and making \n reparations to the Turks and Kurds."\n\nAfter all, your criminal grandparents exterminated 2.5 million Muslim\npeople between 1914 and 1920.\n\n\n<C5yyBt.5zo@news.cso.uiuc.edu>\nhovig@uxa.cso.uiuc.edu (Hovig Heghinian)\n\n\nYou must be a new Armenian clown. You are counting on ASALA/SDPA/ARF \ncrooks and criminals to prove something for you? No wonder you are in \nsuch a mess. That criminal idiot and 'its' forged/non-existent junk has \nalready been trashed out by Mutlu, Cosar, Akgun, Uludamar, Akman, Oflazer \nand hundreds of people. Moreover, ASALA/SDPA/ARF criminals are responsible \nfor the massacre of the Turkish people that also prevent them from entering \nTurkiye and TRNC. SDPA has yet to renounce its charter which specifically \ncalls for the second genocide of the Turkish people. This racist, barbarian \nand criminal view has been touted by the fascist x-Soviet Armenian government \nas merely a step on the road to said genocide. \n\nNow where shall I begin?\n\n#From: ahmet@eecg.toronto.edu (Parlakbilek Ahmet)\n#Subject: YALANCI, LIAR : DAVIDIAN\n#Keywords: Davidian, the biggest liar\n#Message-ID: <1991Jan10.122057.11613@jarvis.csri.toronto.edu>\n\nFollowing is the article that Davidian claims that Hasan Mutlu is a liar:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[some parts are deleted]\n\n\n\n\n				- - -\n\n\n\n\nReceiving this message, I checked the reference, L.Kuper,"Genocide..." and\nwhat I have found was totally consistent with what Davidian said.The book\nwas like "voice of Armenian revolutionists" and although I read the whole book,\nI could not find the original quota.\nBut there was one more thing to check:The original posting of Mutlu.I found \nthe original article of Mutlu.It is as follows:\n\n\n\n     ======================================================================\n    ======\n\nQUATO IS THE SAME, REFERENCE IS DIFFERENT !\n\nDAVIDIAN LIED AGAIN, AND THIS TIME HE CHANGED THE ORIGINAL POSTING OF MUTLU\nJUST TO ACCUSE HIM TO BE A LIAR.\n\nDavidian, thank you for writing the page number correctly...\n\nYou are the biggest liar I have ever seen.This example showed me that tomorrow\nyou can lie again, and you may try to make me a liar this time.So I decided\nnot to read your articles and not to write answers to you.I also advise\nall the netters to do the same.We can not prevent your lies, but at least\nwe may save time by not dealing with your lies.\n\nAnd for the following line:\n\nI also return all the insults you wrote about Mutlu to you.\nI hope you will be drowned in your lies.\n\nAhmet PARLAKBILEK\n\n#From: vd8@cunixb.cc.columbia.edu (Vedat  Dogan)\n#Message-ID: <1993Apr8.233029.29094@news.columbia.edu>\n\n \nn>crap posted by Mr. [(*]!\n \n o boy!   \n \n Please, can you tell us why those quotes are "crap"?..because you do not \n like them!!!...because they really exist...why?\n \n As I said in my previous posting, those quotes exactly exist in the source \n given by Serdar Argic .. \n  \n You couldn't reject it...\n \n \n Here we go again..\n In the book I have, both the front page and the Author's preface give \n the same year: 1923 and 15 January, 1923, respectively!\n (Anyone can check it at her/his library,if not, I can send you the copies of\n pages, please ask by sct) \n \n \nI really don't care what year it was first published(1923 or 1924)\nWhat I care about is what the book writes about murders, tortures,et..in\nthe given quotes by Serdar Argic, and your denial of these quotes..and your\ngroundless accussations, etc. \n \n[...]\n \n \n I claim I have a book in my hand published in 1923(first publication)\n and it exactly has the same quoted info as the book published\n in 1934(Serdar Argic's Reference) has..You couldn't reject it..but, now you\n are avoiding the real issues by twisting around..\n \n Let's see how you lie!..(from 'non-existing' quotes to re-publication)\n \n First you said there was no such a quote in the given reference..You\n called Serdar Argic a liar!..\n I said to you, NO, MR.Davidian, there exactly existed such a quote...\n (I even gave the call number, page numbers..you could't reject it.)\n \n And now, you are lying again and talking about "modified,re-published book"\n(without any proof :how, when, where, by whom, etc..)..\n (by the way, how is it possible to re-publish the book in 1923 if it was\n  first published in 1924(your claim).I am sure that you have some 'pretty \n  well suited theories', as usual)\n \n And I am ready to send the copies of the necessary pages to anybody who\n wants to compare the fact and Mr.Davidian's lies...I also give the call number\n and page numbers again for the library use, which are:  \n                 949.6 R 198\n   \n  and the page numbers to verify the quotes:218 and 215\n              \n     \n \n \n Now, are you claiming that there can't be such a reference by saying "it is\n not possible..." ..If not, what is your point?\n \n Differences in the number of pages?\n Mine was published in 1923..Serdar Argic's was in 1934..\n No need to use the same book size and the same letter \n charachter in both publications,etc, etc.. does it give you an idea!!\n \n The issue was not the number of pages the book has..or the year\n first published.. \n And you tried to hide the whole point..\n the point is that both books have the exactly the same quotes about\n how moslems are killed, tortured,etc by Armenians..and those quotes given \n by Serdar Argic exist!! \n It was the issue, wasn't-it?

Dear Mr. Beyer:\n\nIt is never wise to confuse "freedom of speech" with "freedom"\nof racism and violent deragatory."\n\nIt is unfortunate that many fail to understand this crucial \ndistinction.\n\nIndeed, I find the latter in absolute and complete contradiction\nto the former. Racial invective tends to create an atmosphere of\nintimidation where certain individuals (who belong to the group\nunder target group) do not feel the ease and liberty to exercise \n*their* fundamental "freedom of speech."\n\nThis brand of vilification is not sanctioned under "freedom of\nspeech.\n\nSalam,\n\nJohn Absood
While one may question the motives of the Arabs who sold land to Jews,\noften while publicly criticizing the sale of land to Jews, it was the\nJews and not the Arabs who were taken advantage of, as the prices the\nJews paid for barren land was many times the price fertile land was\nbeing sold for in the United States at the same time.
That still doesn't mean we should cheer their deaths.  Policemen are also in \nthe line of fire and their job includes the possibility of getting killed.  \nShould we be happy when they die?  As I said before, the question is not\nwhether or not you agree with the policies of Israel.  You may wish for the\nIsraelis to cease occupation, but don't rejoice in death.
At issue was not a trial behind closed doors, but arrest, trial and\nimprisonment in complete secrecy.  This was appraently attempted in the\ncase of Vanunu and failed.  It has happened before, and there is reason\nto believe it still goes on.\n\nRead this:\n\nFrom Ma'ariv, February 18 (possibly 28), 1992\n\nPUBLICATION BAN\n\n        The State of Israel has never officially admitted that for many\n        years there have been in its prisons Israeli citizens who were\n        sentenced to long prison terms without either the fact of\n        their arrest or the crimes of which they were accused ever\n        being made public.\n\nBy Baruch Me'iri\n\nAll those involved in this matter politely refused my request, one way\nor another: "Look, the subject is too delicate.  If I comment on it, I\nwill be implicitly admitting that it is true; If I mention a specific\ncase, even hint at it, I might be guilty of making public something\nwhich may legally not be published".\n\nThe State of Israel has never officially admitted that for many years\nthere have been in its prisons Israeli citizens who were sentenced to\nlong prison terms without either the fact of their arrest or the\ncrimes of which they were accused ever being made public. More\nprecisely: A court ordered publication ban was placed on the fact of\ntheir arrest, and later on their imprisonment.\n\nIn Israel of 1993, citizens are imprisoned without us, the citizens of\nthis country, knowing anything about it.  Not knowing anything about\nthe fact that one person or another were tried and thrown in prison,\nfor security offenses, in complete secrecy.\n\nIn the distant past -- for example during the days of the [Lavon - YA]\naffair -- we heard about "the third man" being in prison.  But many\nyears have passed since then, and what existed then can today no\nlonger be found even in South American countries, or in the former\nCommunist countries.\n\nBut it appears that this is still possible in Israel of 1993.\n\nThe Chair of the Knesset Committee on Law, the Constitution and\nJustice, MK David Zucker, sent a letter on this subject early this\nweek to the Prime Minister, the Minister of Justice, and the Cabinet\nLegal Advisor.  Ma'ariv has obtained the content of the letter:\n\n"During the past several years a number of Israeli citizens have been\nimprisoned for various periods for security offenses.  In some of\nthese cases a legal publication ban was imposed not only on the\nspecifics of the crimes for which the prisoners were convicted, but\neven on the mere fact of their imprisonment.  In those cases, after\nbeing legally convicted, the prisoners spend their term in prison\nwithout public awareness either of the imprisonment or of the\nprisoner", asserts MK Zucker.\n\nOn the other hand Zucker agrees in his letter that, "There is\nabsolutely no question that it is possible, and in some cases it is\nimperative, that a publication ban be imposed on the specifics of\nsecurity offenses and the course of trials.  But even in such cases\nthe Court must weigh carefully and deliberately the circumstances\nunder which a trial will not be held in public.\n\n"However, one must ask whether the imposition of a publication ban on\nthe mere fact of a person's arrest, and on the name of a person\nsentenced to prison, is justified and appropriate in the State of\nIsrael.  The principle of public trial and the right of the public to\nknow are not consistent with the disappearance of a person from public\nsight and his descent into the abyss of prison."\n\nZucker thus decided to turn to the Prime Minister, the Minister of\nJustice and the Cabinet Legal Advisor and request that they consider\nthe question.  "The State of Israel is strong enough to withstand the\ncost incurred by abiding by the principle of public punishment.  The\nState of Israel cannot be allowed to have prisoners whose detention\nand its cause is kept secret", wrote Zucker.\n\nThe legal counsel of the Civil Rights Union, Attorney Mordechai\nShiffman said that, "We, as the Civil Rights Union, do not know of any\ncases of security prisoners, Citizens of Israel, who are imprisoned,\nand whose imprisonment cannot be made public.  This is a situation\nwhich, if it actually exists, is definitely unhealthy.  Just like\ncensorship is an unhealthy matter".\n\n"The Union is aware", says Shiffman, "of cases where notification of a\nsuspect's arrest to family members and lawyers is withheld.  I am\nspeaking only of several days.  I know also of cases where a detainee\nwas not allowed to meet with an attorney -- sometimes for the whole\nfirst month of arrest.  That is done because of the great secrecy.\n\n"The suspect himself, his family, his lawyer -- or even a journalist --\ncan challenge the publication ban in court.  But there are cases where\nthe family members themselves are not interested in publicity.  The\njournalist knows nothing of the arrest, and so almost everyone is\nhappy..."\n\nAttorney Yossi Arnon, an official of the Bar, claims that given the\nlaws as they exist in Israel today, a situation where the arrest of a\nperson for security offenses is kept secret is definitely possible. \n"Nothing is easier.  The court orders a publication ban, and that's\nthat.  Someone who has committed security offenses can spend long\nyears in prison without us knowing anything about it."\n\n-- Do you find this situation acceptable?\n\nAttorney Arnon: "Definitely not.  We live in a democratic country, and\nsuch a state of affairs is impermissible.  I am well aware that\npublication can be damaging -- from the standpoint of security -- but\ntotal non-publication, silence, is unacceptable. Consider the trial of\nMordechai Vanunu: at least in his case we know that he was charged\nwith aggravated espionage and sentenced to 18 years in prison.  The\ntrial was held behind closed doors, nobody knew the details except for\nthose who were authorized to.  It is somehow possible to understand,\nthough not to accept, the reasons, but, as I have noted, we at least\nare aware of his imprisonment."\n\n-- Why is the matter actually that serious?  Can't we trust the\ndiscretion of the court?\n\nAttorney Arnon: "The judges have no choice but to trust the\npresentations made to them. The judges do not have the tools to\ninvestigate.  This gives the government enormous power, power which\nthey can misuse."\n\n-- And what if there really is a security issue?\n\nAttorney Arnon: "I am a man of the legal system, not a security expert.\n Democracy stands in opposition to security.  I believe it is possible\nto publicize the matter of the arrest and the charges -- without\nentering into detail.  We have already seen how the laws concerning\npublication bans can be misused, in the case of the Rachel Heller\nmurder.  A suspect in the murder was held for many months without the\nmatter being made public."\n\nAttorney Shiffman, on the other hand, believes that state security can\nbe a legitimate reason for prohibiting publication of a suspect's\narrest, or of a convicted criminal's imprisonment.  "A healthy\nsituation?  Definitely not.  But I am aware of the fact that mere\npublication may be harmful to state security".\n\nA different opinion is expressed by attorney Uri Shtendal, former\nadvisor for Arab affairs to Prime Ministers Levi Eshkol and Golda\nMeir.  "Clearly, we are speaking of isolated special cases.  Such\nsituations contrast with the principle that a judicial proceeding must\nbe held in public. No doubt this contradicts the principle of freedom\nof expression.  Definitely also to the principle of individual freedom\nwhich is also harmed by the prohibition of publication.\n\n"Nevertheless", adds Shtendal, "the legislator allowed for the\npossibility of such a ban, to accommodate special cases where the\ndamage possible as a consequence of publication is greater than that\nwhich may follow from an abridgment of the principles I've mentioned.\nThe authority to decide such matters of publication does not rest with\nthe Prime Minister or the security services, but with the court, which\nwe may rest assured will authorize a publication ban only if it has\nbeen convinced of its need beyond a shadow of a doubt."\n\nNevertheless, attorney Shtendal agrees: "As a rule, clearly such a\nphenomenon is undesirable. Such an extreme step must be taken only in\nthe most extreme circumstances."

It is very encouraging that a number of people took so interest in my posting.I recieved a couple of letters too,some has debated the statement that events in Bosnia are unprecedented in the history of the modern world.Those who contest this statement present the figures of the World War II.However we must keep in mind that it was a World War and no country had the POWER to stop it,today is the matter not of the POWER but of the WILL.It\nseems to be that what we lack is the will.\nSecond point of difference (which makes it different from the holocast(sp?) ) is that at that time international community\ndidnot have enough muscle to prevent the unfortunate event,\ntoday inspite of all the might,the international community is not just standing neutral but has placed an arms embargo which\nis to the obvious disadvantage of the weeker side and therefore to the advantage of the bully.Hence indirecltly and possibly\nunintentionally, mankind has sided with the killers.And this,I think is unprecedented in the history of the modern world.

Only\nTV could transmit the full sadness of his face. "You say that we\nteach our children to hate you, but what do you expect to happen\nto a child who sees this ?" And once again he wraps himself in a\nlengthy silence, his face crumbling into weeping. Mahmoud stood in\nthe field of rubble that was once his home. The term\n'dispossession' has an absolute meaning here. Nothing is left of\nwhat he accumulated during his entire life, only the rubble of a\nhouse and shreds of belongings.\n\nOnce again Khan Yunis. Once again demolished homes. Last Thursday\nthere was a search for wanted people here. Once again the IDF\nforces employed the new method, fired and bombed and shot missiles\nand placed explosives. Already three times during the past weeks I\nhave gone out to see the destruction and each time I was more\nhorrifying scenes. This time they hit the largest number of\nhouses, 17 according to the IDF estimate, ten of them completely\ndemolished. But not only that:  the method has also become more\nbrutal. Three weeks ago, in Tufah neighborhood in Gaza, the\nresidents were still told to remove their valuables from their\nhomes.  This time the army skipped that part; three weeks ago the\nhandcuffed men, inhabitants of the demolished homes, were supplied\nwith some water and one apple during the 12 hours they had to\nstand. This time there was only water. Three weeks ago they were\neven allowed to go out to the toilet. This time the soldier just\ngold them: Piss and shit in your pants. And thus, last Thursday,\nsome 45 men stood for about 12 hours, their hands bound behind\ntheir backs, their eyes blindfolded, without food, with wet pants\non their legs and a terrible feeling of humiliation in their\nhearts, listening to the sounds of the explosions destroying their\nhomes, one after the other.\n\n(...)
Hamza answers one of my articles:\n\n[TO] If indeed Israeli soldiers killed a "Hamas Mujahid" with an anti-tank\n[TO] missile then I'm almost sure that the "terrorist zionists" would not\n[TO] have been able to cut up a body which was probably desintegrated by the\n[TO] missile.\n\n[Hamza] maybe the missile didn't hit directly such that his body\n[Hamza] gets "desintegrated."  of course, destroying 10 houses to\n[Hamza] kill someone is not a surgical operation, or is it?\n\nWell done Hamza. You edited my answer to Anas Omran, took everything out\nof context and then replied to it the way you wanted.\nNow I really understand why the peace process is not making any progress.\n\nYou guys ain't listening, just babbling away to your same old rhetoric.

May I suggest you chech out the _Palestinian National Covenant (1964)_.  It may\nnot use the exact words as quoted above but I'm sure many will agree that the\nsame message is being issued.  Later on when I get back home I will try to find\nthe precise section(s) but you can do the research for now (I hope).  I also\nrealize that Yasser Arafat renounced the _Covenant_ *to the Western media only*\nbut he has yet to inform the PNC officially and enequivocally of his exact\nintentions on this issue.  Therefore, as far as we are concerned the _Covenant_\nstill stands as the "Bible" (so to speak) of the mainstream Palestinian\nNational movement!\n\n\n\nAs a staunch pro-Israel activist I can confidently say that Bnai Brith has NOT\ninfluenced my opinions on the Arab-Israeli conflict.  As I mentioned above,\njust a little research on the subject will lead anyone to reach a similar\nconclusion on the Palestinian National movement (the PLO in most cases).  BB\ndoes not properly speak for me nor many of the people around me who share\nmy views.\n\n\nWhat 1948 situation?  A negative situation I presume?  Is this the same\n"situation" when the Jordanian occupiers of East Jerusalem would not allow the\nJews to go worship at the HOLIEST SITE IN JUDIASM?  Was this an example of\nQu'ranic law being exercised?  If not, I have another suggested reading for\nyou... get into the "soc.culture.arabic" newsgroup where the posters have been\ndebating the topic "Jews in the Qu'ran" (and may I remind you the people doing\nthe debating appear to be devout Muslims with some knowledge of the Qu'ran).\nYou will find that Jews aren't really viewed positively by the Qu'ran (to put\nit lightly).  So how do you think Jews (or any other non-Islamic religion) will\nbe treated by an Islamic state governed by the words of the Qu'ran?  I think\nthe 1948-1967 "situation" in Jerusalem will return *at best*!  What do you\nthink?\n\n\nAll I have to say to that is, once again, see s.c.a - "Jews in the Qu'ran" and\nthink again.  "Freedom of choice" is *definitely* not an option in Qu'ranic\nlaw especially for non-Muslims and ALL women!  Remember the Gulf War?  I'm sure\nyou saw the reports about how women had few rights in Saudi Arabia (an Islamic\nstate).\n\n\nProbably nothing!

Mack posted:\n\n"I know nothing about statistics, but what significance does the\nrelatively small population growth rate have where the sampling period\nis so small (at the end of 1371)?"\n\nThis is not small. A 2.7 per cent annual population growth rate implies\na doubling in 69/2.7 \approx 25 years. Can you imagine that? Most people\nseem not able to, and that is why so many deny that this problem exists,\nfor me most especially in the industrialised countries (low growth rates,\nbut large environmental impact). Iran's high growth rate threatens things\nlike accelerated desertification due to intensive agriculture, deforestation,\nand water table drop. Similar to what is going on in California (this year's\nrain won't save you in Stanford!). This is probably more to blame than \nthe current government's incompetence for dropping living standards\nin Iran.
Well, these are Armenian and Jewish scholars, not me. Denying the obvious?\n\n\nSource: Hovannisian, Richard G.: Armenia on the Road to Independence, 1918.\nUniversity of California Press (Berkeley and Los Angeles), 1967, p. 13.\n\n"The addition of the Kars and Batum oblasts to the Empire increased the\n area of Transcaucasia to over 130,000 square miles. The estimated population\n of the entire region in 1886 was 4,700,000, of whom 940,000 (20 percent) were\n Armenian, 1,200,000 (25 percent) Georgian, and 2,220,000 (45 percent) Moslem.\n Of the latter group, 1,140,000 were Tatars. Paradoxically, barely one-third\n of Transcaucasia's Armenians lived in the Erevan guberniia, where the \n Christians constituted a majority in only three of the seven uezds. Erevan\n uezd, the administrative center of the province, had only 44,000 Armenians\n as compared to 68,000 Moslems. By the time of the Russian Census of 1897,\n however, the Armenians had established a scant majority, 53 percent, in the\n guberniia; it had risen by 1916 to 60 percent, or 670,000 of the 1,120,000\n inhabitants. This impressive change in the province's ethnic character \n notwithstanding, there was, on the eve of the creation of the Armenian \n Republic, a solid block of 370,000 Tartars who continued to dominate the \n southern districts, from the outskirts of Ereven to the border of Persia." \n (See also Map 1.

Our troops surrounded village after village. \n Little resistance was offered.

Some of the Tartars escaped of course. They \n found refuge in the mountains or succeeded in crossing the border \n into Turkey. The rest were killed. And so it is that the whole \n length of the borderland of Russian Armenia from Nakhitchevan to \n Akhalkalaki from the hot plains of Ararat to the cold mountain \n plateau of the North were dotted with mute mournful ruins of \n Tartar villages.

The Armenians tore apart the Ottoman Empire's eastern provinces,\nmassacred 2.5 million defenseless Turkish women, children and elderly \npeople, burned thousands of Turkish and Kurdish villages and exterminated \nthe entire Turkish population of the Armenian dictatorship between \n1914-1920. Such outrageous sleight of hand that is still employed today \nin Armenia brings a depth and verification to the Turkish genocide \nthat is hard to match. A hundred years ago Armenians again thought \nthey could get whatever they wanted through sheer terror like the \nRussian anarchists that they accepted as role models. Several Armenian \nterror groups like ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle \nresorted to the same tactics in the 1980s, butchering scores of innocent\nTurks and their families in the United States and Europe. It seems that \nthey are doing it again, at a different scale, in fascist x-Soviet Armenia \ntoday.\n\nA merciless massacre of the civilian population of the small Azeri \ntown of Khojali (Pop. 6000) in Karabagh, Azerbaijan, is reported to \nhave taken place on the night of Feb. 28 under a coordinated military \noperation of the 366th mechanized division of the CIS army and the \nArmenian insurgents. Close to 1000 people are reported to have been \nmassacred. Elderly and children were not spared. Many were badly beaten \nand shot at close range. A sense of rage and helplessness has overwhelmed \nthe Azeri population in face of the well armed and equipped Armenian \ninsurgency. The neighboring Azeri city of Aghdam outside of the\nKarabagh region has come under heavy Armenian artillery shelling. City \nhospital was hit and two pregnant women as well as a new born infant \nwere killed. Azerbaijan is appealing to the international community to \ncondemn such barbaric and ruthless attacks on its population and its \nsovereignty.\n\nSerdar Argic
>>I'm surprised that you don't consider the acquisition of land by\n   >>the Jews from arabs, for the purpose of establishing an exclusive\n   >>state, as a hostile action leading to war.\n\n\nCould you please tell me what was the ethnic composition of \nIsrael right after it was formed. \n\n\n\nNo one in his right mind would sell his freedom and dignity.\nPalestinians are no exception. Perhaps you heard about\nanti-trust in the business world.\n\nSince we are debating the legality of a commercial\ntransaction, we must use the laws governing the guidelines\nand ethics of such transactions. Basic ANTI-TRUST law says\nthat, while you can purchase IBM stocks for the purpose of\ninvesting, you can not acquire a large number of those\nshares with the intent or controlling IBM. You can do so\nonly if you make your intentions CLEAR apriori . Clearly,\nthe Jews who purchased properties from palastenians had some\ndesigns, they were not buying a dwelling or a real estate.\nThey were establishing a bridgehead for the European Jews.\n\nThe palastenians sold their properties to the Jews in the\nold tradition of arab hospitality. Being a multi-ethnic /\nmulti-religious society, accepting the jews as neighbours\nwas no different, just another religion. Plus they paid fair\nmarket value, etc... They did not know they were victims of\nan international conspiracy. (I'm not a conspiracy theorist\nmyself, but this one is hard to dismiss).\n\n\n\n\nAgain Adam, the devil is in the details. I don't want to get\non a tangent here but its the same reasonning that says its\nOK to return 100 deportes and leave the rest. Because 100 is\na nice number that you can devide by 10, 100 and besides, it\nhas an integer square root.\n\n\n\nDo you actually believe this? My experience tells me that\nevery palestinian I knew still keeps the key to his home, in\nPalestine. Besides they often refer to their exodus as an\nescape from hell (so to speak). I know none that agrees with\nyou. Did you sample their opinions? I know you don't care,\njust being rethorical.\n\n\n\n\nDon't get me wrong. I beleive that Israel is democratic\nwithin the constraints of one dominant ethnic group (Jews).\nIsrael probably had a few options after 1948: ethnic\ncleansing Serbian style, and deserve the wrath of the\ninternational community, or make the best out of a no win\ncondition: show the world how good Israel is towards the\n'bad' arabs. Personaly, I've never heard anything about the\narab community in Isreal. Except that they're there.  So\nyes, they're there. But as a community with history and\nroots, its dead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI stand corrected. I meant that the jewish culture was not\npredominant in Palestine in recent history. I have no\nproblem with Jerusalem having a jewish character if it were\npredominantly Jewish.

Obviously, you really don't know.\n\nThey *have* spoken out (cf Sec'y of State Christopher's recent trip to the ME),\nthey have provided millions in aid, and they have participated in the airlifts\nto Sarajevo.

From: Center for Policy Research <cpr>\nSubject: rejoinder. Questions to Israelis\n\n\nDear Josh\n\nI appreciate the fact that you sought to answer my questions.\n\nHaving said that, I am not totally happy with your answers.\n\n1.   You did not fully answer my question whether Israeli ID cards\nidentify the holders as Jews or Arabs. You imply that U.S.\ncitizens must identify themselves by RACE. Is that true ? Or are\njust trying to mislead the reader ? Do you know of any democratic\ncountry where people are asked to reveal their ethnical or\nreligious identity to any public official who so requests ?\n\n2.  The answer to the second question is evasive. There are all\nkinds of maps issued.  They are not equivalent to State policy.\nYou did not respond to my question.\n\n3.  Your answer to the third question (Israeli nuclear arsenal) is\ninteresting. You say that Israeli 'probably' stocks nuclear\nweapons. What evidence have you for maintaining that ?\n\n4.  My fourth question was answered by someone else who posted a\nMa'ariv article documenting such cases. I did not ask about cases\nlike Vanunu (everybody knew he was tried and imprisoned) but about\nthose about whom nobody even knows that they have been tried and\nimprisoned.\n\n5.  Thanks for clarifying the question concerning the legal status\nof the inhabitants of the occupied territories. From it I\nunderstand that there are two sets of laws in these ares, one for\nthe occupier (civil law) and one for the occupied (military law).\nThe law allows Israeli Arabs to settle in Hebron, it seems. If so,\nwhy doesn't it allow Hebron Arabs to settle in Israel ?\n\n6. Your answer to the question concerning rights to return\nconflicts with what I was told, namely that hundreds of thousands\nof non-Jews who left for some reason or other the area under\nIsrael control during the war of 1947-8, were prevented from\nreturning for the sole reason they were not Jews. Jews who also\nleft, for example to Europe, to avoid the clashes, were allowed to\nreturn. How can you justify such discrimination, if this is true ?\nIs the mere fact of a person leaving area of combat to seek refuge\nsomewhere else a reason for stripping him of his right to live in\nhis homeland ?\n\n7.  Somebody answered my 7.question regarding Y. Rabin signing an\norder for ethnical cleansing in 1948. According to that\ninformation, Y. Rabin signed the order for the expulsion of all\ninhabitants of Lydda and Ramleh, about 50,000 people.  These\nexpulsions were helped by massacres of civilians and other\natrocities which remind Bosnia. I was referred to a book by\nIsraeli journalist Benny Goodman called The Origin of the\nPalestinian Refugee Problem, published by Cambridge University\nPress. Is this book available in your library ?\n\n8.  You maintain that there are some Israeli Arabs living in\nIsraeli kibbutzim. I wonder how many and where. There is very\nlittle evidence available about that. As much as I know, many\nArabs are working *for* kibbutzim, even for many years, but are\nnot accepted as members. Could it be that kibbutzim do not want\nArabs ?\n\n9.  My question about the lack of civil marriage in Israel was\nwhether it is true that the Israeli legislator intended to\ndiscourage intermarriage. You did not address this question but\nevaded it by saying that the 'entire religious establishment wants\nto keep it what way'. I am certain that if only religious\ncommunities in the U.S. would be asked, they would gladly abolish\ncivil marriage so that people would depend upon rabbis and priests\nto officiate marriages. But Israel has always been ruled by a\nsecular majority. Your answer is not satisfactory.\n\n\nI would be glad to have some more input from you after these\ncomments.
You shouldn't think many Turks read Mutlu/Argic stuff.\nThey are in my kill file, likewise any other fanatic.\n \n\nWell, Panos, Mr. Tamamidis?, the way you put it it is only the Turks\nwho bear the responsibility of the things happening today. That is hard to\nbelieve for somebody trying to be objective.\nWhen it comes to conflicts like our countries having you cannot\nblame one side only, there always are bad guys on both sides.\nWhat were you doing on Anatolia after the WW1 anyway?\nDo you think it was your right to be there?\nI am not saying that conflicts started with that. It is only\nnot one side being the aggressive and the ither always suffering.\nIt is sad that we (both) still are not trying to compromise.\nI remember the action of the Turkish government by removing the\nvisa requirement for greeks to come to Turkey. I thought it\nwas a positive attempt to make the relations better.\n\nThe Greeks I mentioned who wouldn't talk to me are educated\npeople. They have never met me but they know! I am bad person\nbecause I am from Turkey. Politics is not my business, and it is\nnot the business of most of the Turks. When it comes to individuals \nwhy the hatred? So that makes me think that there is some kind of\nbrainwashing going on in Greece. After all why would an educated person \ntreat every person from a nation the same way? can you tell me about your \nhistory books and things you learn about Greek-Turkish\nencounters during your schooling. \ntake it easy! \n\n--\nTankut Atan\ntankut@iastate.edu
In my postings I have made a proposal for comments and discussion.\nThose who don't want to discuss its merits and drawbacks are not forced to\ndo so.\n\nHowever I would make anybody who incites others to harm me or harass\nin a personal manner, legally responsible for their deeds. I cannot\naccept and will not accept threats to my personal integrity and I\nurge anybody who opposes terror to refrain from direct or indriect\nthreats.\n\nPS: My proposal has nothing to do with Nazi eugenics. It has to do with\nthe search for peace which would enable justice. I don't consider that\njustice is done, when non-Jews who fled or were expelled in 1948/1967\nare not permitted to return to their homeland. This can at best be called\npragmatism, a nice word for legitimizing the rule of the strong. It can\nnever be called justice. And peace without justice will never be peace.\nIt is my conviction that the situation in which a state, through the\nlaw, attempts to discourage mixed marriages (as Israel does), is not\nnormal. Such a state resembles more Nazi Germany and South Africa than\nWestern democracies, such as the United States, in which Jews are free to\nmarry whom they wish and do so in the thousands. My proposal may have\ndrawbacks but it is meant to force anybody to anything, just to\ncompensate for a certain time mixed couples for the hardships tehy\nendure in a society which disapproves of intermarriage.When the day\nwill come and Israel will become a truly civil and decmoractic society,\nin which the state is not concerned with the religious or ethnic\naffiliation of its constituency, such a Fund would not be needed any\nmore. I don't mind if Jews wish to marry Jews and keep their\ntraditions, why not ? But this is not the affairs of a state. Western\ndemocracy clearly separates these domains and I am certain that\nmost\nAmerican Jews enjoy this fact and would not love to live in a state termed\nChristian State and to have their Green cards stamped with a mark JEW.\n\nI would ask those who are genuinely interested in an exchange of views\nand personal experiencces to refrain from emotional, infantile\noutbursts which might leed readers to infer that Jews who respect\nJudaism are uncivilized. Such behaviour is not good for Judaism.

Even if\n  the difficulties of the darker centuries immediately preceding the\n  fourteenth are minimized, it is easy to understand the attraction which\n  Ottoman life, particularly when compared to life in Europe, held for the\n  Jews. There is no way to tell how many Jews left Christendom for the\n  realm of the rising Muslim Ottomans, but with each account of persecution\n  in or expulsion from Christian countries it is recorded that some Jews\n  fled to Ottoman territory. The regularity of these reports suggests that\n  the Ottomans were considered reasonably tolerant protectors and that\n  there was a regular trickle of Jewish families moving southward and\n  eastward from Western and Central Europe. (...) It is evident that the\n  effects of plague, late crusades, and the general intolerance and\n  persecution of Jews in Christian Europe resulted in the redirection\n  of the whole focus of Jewish life which, for more than two centuries,\n  was to be oriented toward Muslim East.>>\n\n\n  page 21:\n\n  <<In the second quarter of the fifteenth century the foremost official\n  in the  Edirne Jewish community was Rabbi Yitzhak Sarfati the Ashkenazi\n  Chief Rabbi of the city. He was the most important rabbi in the city and\n  the author of an important letter which tells us something of the situation\n  of the Edirne Jewry in the fifteenth century. Sarfati himself was from\n  Christian Europe and supposedly wrote this letter at the behest of two\n  recent arrivals from there, who, upon seeing the prosperity and freedom\n  of the Ottoman Jews, prevailed upon him to write their European\n  coreligionists apprising them of the situation and urging them to migrate.\n  This remarkable letter advised its recipients not only of the pleasant\n  conditions in the Ottoman domains, but described as well the ease of\n  travel to Palestine and the holy places, an attraction to those who\n  would make a pilgrimage or choose to be buried there.>> (*)\n\n\n  page 41:\n\n <<...the impression gained from the Hebrew sources is that the Jews were\n firmly aware of the community of interests which existed between them\n and the Ottomans, especially in comparison to relations with the Christians\n of Europe.\n\n Confirmation of the commonality of interests between Muslims and Jews is\n also indicated by the fact that European Christians perceived the Jews\n as allies of Islam and were well aware of Muslim-Jewish cooperation.\n Certainly the activity of important Jewish financiers and politicians\n representing the Ottoman government abroad did not pass unnoticed. European\n sources are the basis for much of our knowledge of their careers. In addition\n it appears that Christian pirates plundered ''Turks and Jews,''  their\n sworn enemies, and that Europeans considered the Jews to be agents who\n regularly reported to the Ottomans.\n\n There are well-known examples of overt Jewish support for the Ottomans\n in the struggle against European powers. The two best known instances\n of Jewish support for the campaigning Ottomans are the frequently cited\n instances of the Jewish contributions to the conquests of Buda, in the\n early sixteenth century, and of Rhodes. We also have reports of sympathy\n for the Ottomans during the siege of Chios. An unpublished Ottoman\n document shows dramatically the mutual interests which existed in some\n Greek towns...>>\n\n page 43:\n\n  <<It is clear that throughout the sixteenth century it was a generally\n accepted fact that the interests of Jews and Muslims coincided frequently,\n and all parties involved, Jews, Muslims, and Christians, were aware of\n the situation.>>\n\n\n page 46:\n\n <<...it seems that the relations between Greeks and Jews were not\n particularly cordial. The two groups had little in common, few common\n interests, and perceived no common philosophical or religious tradition\n which could serve as the basis for cooperation, rather than enmity. If\n there was any identifiable bond of good will which existed between\n religious communities in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, it was\n that between Muslims and Jews, neither of whom had much in common with\n the Orthodox.>>\n\n page 46:\n\n <<The general impression of Muslim-Jewish relations in the Ottoman context\n during the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries is one of community of\n interests. From the earliest times the Ottomans seem to have welcomed\n Jews to their territory and to have found in the communities already\n existing in places which they conquered a cooperative element. The Jewish\n response to this tolerance was a steady flow of Jews from Christian\n countries to Ottoman domains.>>\n\n page 151:\n\n  <<From the period before 1453 we have only a few indications that the\n  Ottoman-Jewish relationship was well on the course of amity which would\n  characterize it for years afterward, but the liberality of the Ottomans,\n  in contrast to the intolerance of the Byzantines, and the protection and\n  the security which the Ottomans offered, in comparison to conditions\n  elsewhere, leave little doupt that even then both the Ottomans and the\n  Jews recognized their mutual interests...>>\n\n  page 161:\n\n  <<It is impossible to say how fundamental the Jews were in the success\n  of the Ottomans in rebuilding Istanbul or in Ottoman mercantile success\n  in the sixteenth century. That they played an important role in both\n  cannot be doupted. It is also unclear whether they were important enough\n  to say that the Ottomans would not have experienced their great success\n  without the Jews and that no other group could have been found to serve\n  the Ottomans as well as did the Jews. It is, however, unmistakably clear\n  that there are few parallels in world history to this remarkable\n  partnership between Jews and the non-Jewish society in which they lived.\n  We must conclude that the Ottomans could probably not achieved their\n  success without a group performing certain tasks for them as well as the\n  Jews did. Certainly for the Jews of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries\n  the Ottoman Empire was a most remarkable and salubrious home.>>\n\n\n(*) A version of Rabbi Sarfati's [Tzarfati] letter is given by Prof.Shaw:\n\n  page 32:\n\n  <<Your cries and sobs reached us. We have been told of all the troubles\n  and persecutions which you have to suffer in the German lands....I hear\n  the lamentation of my brethren...The barbarous and cruel nation ruthlessly\n  oppresses the faithful children of the chosen people...The priests and\n  prelates of Rome have risen. They wish to root out the memory of Jacob\n  and erase the name of Israel. They always devise new persecutions. They\n  wish to bring you to the stake...Listen my brethren, to the counsel I will\n  give you. I too was born in Germany and studied Torah with the German\n  rabbis. I was driven out of my native country and came to the Turkish land,\n  which is blessed by God and filled with all good things.

Don't swallow propaganda as truth Sir. British promised to Venizelos\n(greek PM) that mainly greek populated areas of the Ottomans will be\ngiven to Greece, _if_ he will agree to drag Greece in the side of\nthe British during the WWI (because the greek King was proGerman).\nThe British succeeded by bombarding Athens (1916), killing quite a few,\nforcing abdication of the King, division of Greece into two separate\nstates (North-South), and finally laying the ground for the most disasterous\ndivision between greeks for our century.(So don't feel bitter that the\n"Allies" gave any green light because they liked us....)\n\nAnyway, the British succeed to establish Venizelos, war starts at a second\nfront against the Germans in the south while they were fighting the war\nin the East against the Russians, and finally the WWII came in an end.\nAfter that the British (and French) forgot immediately their promises\n(as usually). Even though publicly they say that they support the Greek\ncause, practically they not only do nothing, but instead, using some usual\n"reasoning" and other crap rhetoric as a pretext, they gradually\nbackup Kemal (who had given now to the British "water and bread" that\nhe will dissolve the superethnic Ottoman and contract it into a small\nethnic-state). The main drive behind this British switch was the plan\nto keep a Muslim state in the region as buffer against a Russian expansion\ninto warm-water facilities. The "greek empire" being an Orthodox Christian\nstate was too prone to become Russian client.\n\nOut of this intrigue, the current state of affairs was established on our\nlands. While Venizelos and Kemal were promoted as true "Giants" by the\nBritish, since they worked to realize their goals in the region.\nUnder the same plan, currently Greece and Turkey are recipients of big\nmilitary funds from the US; both they are functioning as anti-Russian\nbuffers, while simultaneously both remain good clients of State Dept. because\notherwise the use of terror of changing "the balance of power in the Aegean"\nwill be used.\n\nUnder the same exact rational you should see the Cyprus problem.\n\nGr

As a result, a part of Azerbaijan has been occupied\nand annexed, hundreds of people killed, thousands wounded.\n\nSome 200,000 Azerbaijanis have been brutally and inhumanly\ndeported from the Armenian SSR, their historical homeland.\nTogether with them 64,000 Russians and 22,000 Kurds have also\nbeen driven out, a part of them now settled in Azerbaijan.\nSome 40,000 Turkish-Meskhetians, Lezghins and representatives \nof other Caucasian nationalities who escaped from the Central\nAsia where the President and government bodies did not guarantee\nthem the life and peace also suffered from these deportations.\n\nOne of the scandalous vandalisms directed not only against\nAzerbaijan science but the world civilization as well is the\nArmenian extremists' destruction of the Karabakh scientific\nexperimental base of The Institute of Genetics and Selection \nof the Academy of Sciences of the Azerbaijan SSR.\n\nWe beg you for humanitarian help and political assistance,\nfor the honour and dignity of 7 million Azerbaijanis are\nviolated, its territory, culture  and history are trampled,\nits people are shot. There is persistent negative image of\nAzerbaijanians abroad, and this defamation is spread over \nthe whole world by Soviet mass media, Armenian lobby in the\nUSSR and the United States. \n\nOne of the myths is that all events allegedly involves and\ngenerated by interethnic collisions and religious intolerance\nwhile the truth is that all these shootings and recent \nevents stem from the territorial claims of Armenia on\nAzerbaijan.\n\nIt is a well documented fact that before the conflict there\nwere no frictions between Armenians and Azerbaijanis on the\nissue of Karabakh. Hundreds and thousands Armenians placidly\nand calmly lived and worked in Azerbaijan land, had their\nrepresentatives in all government bodies of the Azerbaijan\nSSR.\n\nWe are for a united, indivisible, sovereign Azerbaijan, we \nare for a common Caucasian home proclaimed in 1918 by one\nof the founding fathers of the Azerbaijan Democratic \nRepublic - Muhammed Emin Rasulzade.\n\nBut all these goals and expectations are trampled upon the\nSoviet leadership in favour of the Armenian expansionists\nencouraged by Moscow and intended to create a new '1,000\nYear Reich' - the 'Great Armenia' - by annexing the \nneighboring lands.\n\nThe world public opinion shed tears to save the whales,\nsuffers for penguins dying out in the Antarctic Continent.\n\nBut what about the lives of seven million human beings?\nIf these people are Muslims, does it mean that they are\nless valuable?

This is not the first appeal\nof Azerbaijan to the world public opinion. Our previous\nappeals were unheard.

WASHINGTON - A stark reminder of the Holocaust--a speech by Nazi \nSS leader Heinrich Himmler that refers to "the extermination of the\nJewish race"--went on display Friday at the National Archives.\n	The documents, including handwritten notes by Himmler, are\namong the best evidence that exists to rebut claims that the\nHolocaust is a myth, archivists say.\n	"The notes give them their authenticity," said Robert Wolfe,\na supervisory archivist for captured German records.  "He was\nsupposed to destroy them.  Like a lot of bosses, he didn't obey his\nown rules."\n	The documents, moved out of Berlin to what Himmler hoped\nwould be a safe hiding place, were recovered by Allied forces after\nWorld War II from a salt mine near Salzburg, Austria.\n	Himmler spoke on Oct.4, 1943, in Posen, Poland, to more than\n100 German secret police generals.  "I also want to talk to you,\nquite frankly, on a very grave matter.  Among ourselves it should be\nmentioned quite frankly, and yet we will never speak of it publicly.\nI mean the clearing out of the Jew, the extermination of the Jewish\nrace.  This is a page of GLORY in our history which has never been\nwritten and is never to be written."  [Emphasis mine--rje]\n	The German word Himmler uses that is translated as\n"extermination" is *Ausrottung*.\n	Wolfe said a more precise translation would be "extirpation"\nor "tearing up by the roots."\n	In his handwritten notes, Himmler used a euphemism,\n"Judenevakuierung" or "evacuation of the Jews."  But archives\nofficials said "extermination" is the word he actually\nspoke--preserved on an audiotape in the archives.\n	Himmler, who oversaw Adolf Hitler's "final solution of the\nJewish question," committed suicide after he was arrested in 1945.\n	The National Archives exhibit, on display through May 16, is\na preview of the opening of the United States Holocaust Memorial\nMuseum here on April 26.\n	The National Archives exhibit includes a page each of\nHimmler's handwritten notes, a typed transcript from the speech and\nan offical translation made for the Nuremberg war crimes trials.\n\n	---From p.A10 of Saturday's L.A.

Referring to notes from the personal diary of Russian General L. \nOdishe Liyetze on the Turkish front, he wrote,\n\n"On the nights 11-12 March, 1918 alone Armenian butchers \n bayoneted and axed to death 3000 Muslims in areas surrounding\n Erzincan. These barbars threw their victims into pits, most\n likely dug according to their sinister plans to extinguish \n Muslims, in groups of 80. My adjutant counted and unearthed\n 200 such pits. This is an act against our world of civilization."\n\nOn March 12, 1918 Lieut-colonel Griyaznof wrote (from an official\nRussian account of the Turkish genocide),\n\n"Roads leading to villages were littered with bayoneted torsos,\n dismembered joints and carved out organs of Muslim peasants...\n alas! mainly of women and children."\n\nSource: Doc. Dr. Azmi Suslu, "Russian View on the Atrocities Committed\n        by the Armenians Against the Turks," Ankara Universitesi, Ankara,\n        1987, pp. 45-53.\n        "Document No: 77," Archive No: 1-2, Cabin No: 10, Drawer \n        No: 4, File No: 410, Section No: 1578, Contents No: 1-12, 1-18.\n        (Acting Commander of Erzurum and Deveboynu regions and Commander\n        of the Second Erzurum Artillery Regiment Prisoner of War,\n        Lieutenant Colonel Toverdodleyov)\n\n"The things I have heard and seen during the two months, until the\n liberation of Erzurum by the Turks, have surpassed all the\n allegations concerning the vicious, degenerate characteristic of\n the Armenians. During the Russian occupation of Erzurum, no Armenian\n was permitted to approach the city and its environs.\n\n While the Commander of the First Army Corps, General Kaltiyin remained\n in power, troops including Armenian enlisted men, were not sent to the\n area. When the security measures were lifted, the Armenians began to \n attack Erzurum and its surroundings. Following the attacks came the\n plundering of the houses in the city and the villages and the murder\n of the owners of these houses...Plundering was widely committed by\n the soldiers. This plunder was mainly committed by Armenian soldiers\n who had remained in the rear during the war.\n\n One day, while passing through the streets on horseback, a group of\n soldiers including an Armenian soldier began to drag two old men of\n seventy years in a certain direction. The roads were covered with mud,\n and these people were dragging the two helpless Turks through the mud\n and dirt...\n\n It was understood later that all these were nothing but tricks and\n traps. The Turks who joined the gendarmarie soon changed their minds\n and withdrew. The reason was that most of the Turks who were on night\n patrol did not return, and no one knew what had happened to them. The \n Turks who had been sent outside the city for labour began to disappear\n also. Finally, the Court Martial which had been established for the\n trials of murderers and plunderers, began to liquidate itself for\n fear that they themselves would be punished. The incidents of murder\n and rape, which had decreased, began to occur more frequently.\n\n Sometime in January and February, a leading Turkish citizen Haci Bekir\n Efendi from Erzurum, was killed one night at his home. The Commander\n in Chief (Odiselidge) gave orders to find murderers within three days.\n The Commander in Chief has bitterly reminded the Armenian intellectuals\n that disobedience among the Armenian enlisted men had reached its\n highest point, that they had insulted and robbed the people and half\n of the Turks sent outside the city had not returned.\n\n ...We learnt the details this incident from the Commander-in-Chief,\n Odishelidge. They were as follows:\n\n The killings were organized by the doctors and the employers, and the\n act of killing was committed solely by the Armenian renegades...\n More than eight hundred unarmed and defenceless Turks have been\n killed in Erzincan. Large holes were dug and the defenceless \n Turks were slaughtered like animals next to the holes. Later, the\n murdered Turks were thrown into the holes. The Armenian who stood \n near the hole would say when the hole was filled with the corpses:\n 'Seventy dead bodies, well, this hole can take ten more.' Thus ten\n more Turks would be cut into pieces, thrown into the hole, and when\n the hole was full it would be covered over with soil.\n\n The Armenians responsible for the act of murdering would frequently\n fill a house with eighty Turks, and cut their heads off one by one.\n Following the Erzincan massacre, the Armenians began to withdraw\n towards Erzurum... The Armenian renegades among those who withdrew\n to Erzurum from Erzincan raided the Moslem villages on the road, and\n destroyed the entire population, together with the villages.\n\n During the transportation of the cannons, ammunition and the carriages\n that were outside the war area, certain people were hired among the \n Kurdish population to conduct the horse carriages. While the travellers\n were passing through Erzurum, the Armenians took advantage of the time\n when the Russian soldiers were in their dwellings and began to kill\n the Kurds they had hired. When the Russian soldiers heard the cries\n of the dying Kurds, they attempted to help them. However, the \n Armenians threatened the Russian soldiers by vowing that they would\n have the same fate if they intervened, and thus prevented them from\n acting. All these terrifying acts of slaughter were committed with\n hatred and loathing.\n\n Lieutenant Medivani from the Russian Army described an incident that\n he witnessed in Erzurum as follows: An Armenian had shot a Kurd. The\n Kurd fell down but did not die. The Armenian attempted to force the\n stick in his hand into the mouth of the dying Kurd. However, since\n the Kurd had firmly closed his jaws in his agony, the Armenian failed\n in his attempt. Having seen this, the Armenian ripped open the abdomen\n of the Kurd, disembowelled him, and finally killed him by stamping\n him with the iron heel of his boot.\n\n Odishelidge himself told us that all the Turks who could not escape\n from the village of Ilica were killed. Their heads had been cut off\n by axes. He also told us that he had seen thousands of murdered\n children. Lieutenant Colonel Gryaznov, who passed through the village\n of Ilica, three weeks after the massacre told us the following:\n\n There were thousands of dead bodies hacked to pieces, on the roads.\n Every Armenian who happened to pass through these roads, cursed and\n spat on the corpses. In the courtyard of a mosque which was about\n 25x30 meter square, dead bodies were piled to a height of 140 \n centimeters. Among these corpses were men and women of every age,\n children and old people. The women's bodies had obvious marks of\n rape. The genitals of many girls were filled with gun-powder.\n\n A few educated Armenian girls, who worked as telephone operators\n for the Armenian troops were called by Lieutenant Colonel Gryaznov\n to the courtyard of the mosque and he bitterly told them to be \n proud of what the Armenians had done. To the lieutenant colonel's\n disgusted amazement, the Armenian girls started to laugh and giggle,\n instead of being horrified. The lieutenant colonel had severely\n reprimanded those girls for their indecent behaviour. When he told\n the girls that the Armenians, including women, were generally more\n licentious than even the wildest animals, and that their indecent\n and shameful laughter was the most obvious evidence of their inhumanity\n and barbarity, before a scene that appalled even veteran soldiers,\n the Armenian girls finally remembered their sense of shame and\n claimed they had laughed because they were nervous.\n\n An Armenian contractor at the Alaca Communication zone command\n narrated the following incident which took place on February 20:\n\n The Armenians had nailed a Turkish women to the wall. They had cut\n out the women's heart and placed the heart on top of her head.\n The great massacre in Erzurum began on February 7... The enlisted men \n of the artillery division caught and stripped 270 people. Then they\n took these people into the bath to satisfy their lusts. 100 people\n among this group were able to save their lives as the result of\n my decisive attempts. The others, the Armenians claimed, were \n released when they learnt that I understood what was going on. \n Among those who organized this treacherous act was the envoy to the\n Armenian officers, Karagodaviev. Today, some Turks were murdered\n on the streets.\n\n On February 12, some Armenians have shot more than ten innocent\n Moslems. The Russian soldiers who attempted to save these people were\n threatened with death. Meanwhile I imprisoned an Armenian for\n murdering an innocent Turk. \n\n When an Armenian officer told an Armenian murderer that he would \n be hanged for his crime, the killer shouted furiously: 'How dare\n you hang an Armenian for killing a Turk?' In Erzurum, the \n Armenians burned down the Turkish market. On February 17, I heard\n that the entire population of Tepekoy village, situated within\n the artillery area, had been totally annihilated. On the same \n day when Antranik entered Erzurum, I reported the massacre to\n him, and asked him to track down the perpetrators of this horrible\n act. However no result was achieved.\n\n In the villages whose inhabitants had been massacred, there was a\n natural silence. On the night of 26/27 February, the Armenians deceived\n the Russians, perpetrated a massacre and escaped for fear of the \n Turkish soldiers. Later, it was understood that this massacre had\n been based upon a method organized and planned in a circular. \n The population had been herded in a certain place and then killed\n one by one. The number of murders committed on that night reached\n three thousand. It was the Armenians who bragged to about the details\n of the massacre. The Armenians fighting against the Turkish soldiers\n were so few in number and so cowardly that they could not even\n withstand the Turkish soldiers who consisted of only five hundred\n people and two cannons, for one night, and ran away. The leading\n Armenians of the community could have prevented this massacre.\n However, the Armenian intellectuals had shared the same ideas with\n the renegades in this massacre, just as in all the others. The lower\n classes within the Armenian community have always obeyed the orders\n of the leading Armenian figures and commanders. \n\n I do not like to give the impression that all Armenian intellectuals\n were accessories to these murders. No, for there were people who\n opposed the Armenians for such actions, since they understood that\n it would yield no result. However, such people were only a minority.\n Furthermore, such people were considered as traitors to the Armenian\n cause. Some have seemingly opposed the Armenian murders but have\n supported the massacres secretly. Some, on the other hand, preferred\n to remain silent. There were certain others, who, when accused by\n the Russians of infamy, would say the following: 'You are Russians.\n You can never understand the Armenian cause.' The Armenians had a\n conscience. They would commit massacres and then would flee in fear\n of the Turkish soldiers."\n\n\nSerdar Argic

And killing people is mildly agressive (justified, in your opinion \nif they are israeli soldiers, justified, in others' opinion if they are jews, not\njustified at all in others opinion).\n\nWhen Brad wrote the article about 3 Israelis killed, ther was a lot of pride \nand satisfaction in his lines. That's what I feel disgusting. We may agree \nor not when a killing is 'technically' murder, but being enthousiastic about it?\n\n\nAnd again, I may appreciate some of your points, but you are not objective. That\nis not a blame, just a remark.

Danny Rubenstein, an Israeli journalist, will be speaking tonight \n(Wednesday, 7:30 pm) on the messy subject of politics in Israel.\nHe is speaking at Hillel on the U.C. Berkeley campus.  The talk is\nsponsored by the Berkeley Israel Action Committee (IAC).
What else do you expect?  Israel is trying to portray itself\nas the great democracy.  One requirement is to have a leader\nwho previously had an extra-marital affair (e.g. Bill Clinton)\nIt helps if your wife says it's OK.
No, you have completely misunderstood.  I was opposed to intervention in\nSomalia for the same reason I am opposed to intervention in Bosnia - there is\nno security interest of the United States there which justifies risking the\nlives of American servicemen, and there are too many crises in the world for us\nto take on all of them.  In the case of Bosnia, the risks are obviously much\ngreater, and there are other countries in a much better position and with far\nbetter reasons to take action than the US.\n\n\nYou continue to misunderstand.  I did not say the reason why people want to\nintervene is because of racist (<- you seem to be overly fond of using this\nword, btw.  I said the phenomenon was race-related, which is not the same as\nracist.  Perhaps this distinction is too subtle for you to grasp) motives - I\nsaid the attention and outrage at the entire Yugoslavian situation was a result\nof it being 1) closer to home, 2) happening to people we can identify with, and\n3) relentlessly harped on by the media.  I never said anything about which side\nwould be preferred, which has a lot more to do with the presentation of the\nconflict than any psychological factors.  I think there is no doubt that despite\nthe fact we intervened in Somalia, the level of attention devoted to there was\nconsiderably less than what is devoted to Bosnia, if the newspapers and tv news\nI see are any guide.
WASHINGTON (UPI) -- Secretary of State Warren Christopher said Tuesday\n there are better ideas to stop the human slaughter in the Balkans than\n ordering American fighters to bomb the Serbs, but a frustrated senator\n told him to do just that.\n 	``We've not done a damn thing,'' Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., told\n Christopher at a hearing of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. \n ``Preventive diplomacy is not in your capability right now in Bosnia-\n Herzegovina.\n 	Biden chastised the administration and its Republican predecessor for\n what he characterized as a limp response to the Serbian policy of \n ``ethnic cleansing'' of Muslims, including rape and shelling of\n civilians.\n 	``The time has come for us and the world to stop bemoaning the fact\n that all the options are bad ones,'' Biden said. ``They are all bad ones\n and we ought to pick a couple.''\n 	Biden also endorsed lifting an international arms embargo against the\n former Yugoslavia so the Muslim-dominated Bosnian government might have\n a chance to at least defend itself against the Serbs.\n 	Christopher said this could give an opening role in the conflict to\n                     ****************************************************\n the radical Islamic government of Iran.\n***************************************\nO, I C!\n   Biden endorsed bombing Serbian heavy weapons around the besieged\n  eastern town of Srebrenica.\n  	``There's not a military person...who will not tell you that they\n  could today, if you gave them the order, take out the heavy weaponry\n  around Srebrenica,'' Biden said.\n  	``If you did nothing else, nothing else but that, you would have\n  saved hundreds of women and children who are being absolutely massacred\n  right now.''\n  	Military action ``is the only thing that's going to change the\n  equation,'' Biden said.\n....................................\n  	Despite the frustrations and pressure, Christopher had no enthusiasm\n  for American combat aircraft to strike Serb positions in Bosnia-\n  Herzegovina.\n....................\n\nHumanitarian as in feeding them and let them get raped and killed.\n\n	             *******(then)\n	*******************(Now)\n\nWhy don't they get the hell out of there, they ared doing nothing to\nprotect the victims anyway..

... deleted\n\nI am not in the business of reading minds, however in this case it would not\nbe necessary.  Israelis top leaders in the past and present, always come across\nas arrogant with their tough talks trying to intimidate the Arabs.  \n\nThe way I see it, Israelis and Arabs have not been able to achieve peace\nafter almost 50 years of fighting because of the following two major reasons:\n\n 1) Arab governments are not really representative of their people, currently\n    most of their leaders are stupid, and/or not independent, and/or\n    dictators.

April 24th is approaching, and Armenians around the world\nare getting ready to remember the massacres of their family members\nby the Turkish government between 1915 and 1920.  \n    At least 1.5 Million Armenians perished during that period,\nand it is important to note that those who deny that this event\never took place, either supported the policy of 1915 to exterminate\nthe Armenians, or, as we have painfully witnessed in Azerbaijan,\nwould like to see it happen again...\n    Thank you for taking the time to read this post.

Dear Mr. Davidsson,
The comparison of the Palestinian situation with the Holocaust\nis insulting and completely false.  Any person making such a rude\nand false comparison is either ignorant of the Holocaust, or also\nignorant of the situation in the mideast, or is an anti-semite.
Why does the Center For Policy Research pose such unbelievably\nstupid and loaded questions to this newsgroup.  What are you? - a\nthink tank, or a fish tank?  Every time I start to believe I have\nseen the outer boundaries of your stupidity, you come up with one\nstep beyond.  When will it end, man?  Can you actually have brain\nenough to dress and feed yourself each morning?

A genocide of Armenians took place\nduring peacetime.\n\nAnd it was a great tragedy for me personally, because I lost my father in\nthose days. He was still young. Born in 1926.\n\nOn that day, February 28, we were at home. Of course we had heard that there \nwas unrest in town, my younger brother Aleksandr had told us about it. But we \ndidn't think . . . we thought that everything would happen outdoors, that they\nwouldn't go into people's apartments. About five o'clock we saw a large crowd \nnear the Kosmos movie theater in our microdistrict. We were sitting at home \nwatching television. We go out on the balcony and see the crowd pour into Mir \nStreet. This is right near downtown, next to the airline ticket office, our \nhouse is right nearby. That day there was a group of policeman with shields\nthere. They threw rocks at those policemen. Then they moved off in the \ndirection of our building. They burned a motorcycle in our courtyard and \nstarted shouting for Armenians to come out of the building. We switched off \nthe light. As it turns out, their signal was just the opposite: to turn on the\nlight. That meant that it was an Azerbaijani home. We, of course, didn't know \nand thought that if they saw lights on they would come to our apartment.\n\nSuddenly there's pounding on the door. We go to the door, all four of us:\nthere were four of us in the apartment. Father, Mother, my younger brother\nAleksandr, and I. He was born in 1959. My father was a veteran of World War \nII and had fought in China and in the Soviet Far East; he was a pilot.\n\nWe went to the door and they started pounding on it harder, breaking it down \nwith axes. We start to talk to them in Azerbaijani, "What's going on? What's \nhappened?" They say, "Armenians, get out of here!" We don't open the door, we \nsay, "If we have to leave, we'll leave, we'll leave tomorrow." They say, "No, \nleave now, get out of here, Armenian dogs, get out of here!" By now they've \nbroken the door both on the lock and the hinge sides. We hold them off as best\nwe can, my father and I on one side, and my mother and brother on the other. \nWe had prepared ourselves: we had several hammers and an axe in the apartment,\nand grabbed what we could find to defend ourselves. They broke in the door and\nwhen the door gave way, we held it for another half-hour. No neighbors, no\npolice and no one from the city government came to our aid the whole time. We \nheld the door. They started to smash the door on the lock side, first with an \naxe, and then with a crowbar.\n\nWhen the door gave way--they tore it off its hinges--Sasha hit one of them \nwith the axe. The axe flew out of his hands. They also had axes, crowbars, \npipes, and special rods made from armature shafts. One of them hit my father \nin the head. The pressure from the mob was immense. When we retreated into the\nroom, one of them hit my mother, too, in the left part of her face. My brother\nSasha and I fought back, of course. Sasha is quite strong and hot-tempered, he\nwas the judo champion of Sumgait. We had hammers in our hands, and we injured \nseveral of the bandits--in the heads and in the eyes, all that went on. But \nthey, the injured ones, fell back, and others came to take their places, there\nwere many of them.\n\nThe door fell down at an angle. The mob tried to remove the door, so as to go \ninto the second room and to continue . . . to finish us off. Father brought \nskewers and gave them to Sasha and me--we flew at them when we saw Father \nbleeding: his face was covered with blood, he had been wounded in the head, \nand his whole face was bloody. We just threw ourselves on them when we saw \nthat. We threw ourselves at the mob and drove back the ones in the hall, drove\nthem down to the third floor. We came out on the landing, but a group of the \nbandits remained in one of the rooms they were smashing all the furniture in \nthere, having closed the door behind them. We started tearing the door off to \nchase away the remaining ones or finish them. Then a man, an imposing man of \nabout 40, an Azerbaijani, came in. When he was coming in, Father fell down and\nMother flew to him, and started to cry out. I jumped out onto the balcony and \nstarted calling an ambulance, but then the mob started throwing stones through\nthe windows of our veranda and kitchen. We live on the fourth floor. And no \none came. I went into the room. It seemed to me that this man was the leader \nof the group. He was respectably dressed in a hat and a trench coat with a \nfur collar. And he addressed my mother in Azerbaijani: "What's with you, \nwoman, why are you shouting? What happened? Why are you shouting like that?"\nShe says, "What do you mean, what happened? You killed somebody!" My father \nwas a musician, he played the clarinet, he played at many weddings, Armenian \nand Azerbaijani, he played for many years. Everyone knew him. Mother says, \n"The person who you killed played at thousands of Azerbaijani weddings, he \nbrought so much joy to people, and you killed that person." He says, "You \ndon't need to shout, stop shouting." And when they heard the voice of this \nman, the 15 to 18 people who were in the other room opened the door and \nstarted running out. We chased after them, but they ran away. That man left, \ntoo. As we were later told, downstairs one of them told the others, I don't \nknow if it was from fright or what, told them that we had firearms, even\nthough we only fought with hammers and an axe. We raced to Father and started \nto massage his heart, but it was already too late. We asked the neighbors to \ncall an ambulance. The ambulance never came, although we waited for it all \nevening and all through the night.\n\nSomewhere around midnight about 15 policemen came. They informed us they were \nfrom Khachmas. They said, "We heard that a group was here at your place, you \nhave our condolences." They told us not to touch anything and left. Father lay\nin the room.\n\nSo we stayed home. Each of us took a hammer and a knife. We sat at home. Well,\nwe say, if they descend on us again we'll defend ourselves. Somewhere around \none o'clock in the morning two people came from the Sumgait Procuracy, \ninvestigators. They say, "Leave everything just how it is, we're coming back \nhere soon and will bring an expert who will record and photograph everything."\nThen people came from the Republic Procuracy too, but no one helped us take \nFather away. The morning came and the neighbors arrived. We wanted to take \nFather away somehow. We called the Procuracy and the police a couple of times,\nbut no one came. We called an ambulance, and nobody came. Then one of the \nneighbors said that the bandits were coming to our place again and we should \nhide. We secured the door somehow or other. We left Father in the room and \nwent up to the neighbor's.\n\nThe excesses began again in the morning. The bandits came in several vehicles,\nZIL panel trucks, and threw themselves out of the vehicles like . . . a \nlanding force near the center of town. Our building was located right there. A\ncrowd formed. Then they started fighting with the soldiers. Then, in Buildings\n19 and 20, that's next to the airline ticket office, they started breaking \ninto Armenian apartments, destroying property, and stealing. The Armenians \nweren't at home, they had managed to flee and hide somewhere. And again they \npoured in the direction of our building. They were shouting that there were \nsome Armenians left on the fourth floor, meaning us. "They're up there, still,\nup there. Let's go kill them!" They broke up all the furniture remaining in \nthe two rooms, threw it outside, and burned it in large fires. We were hiding \none floor up. Something heavy fell. Sasha threw himself toward the door \nshouting that it was probably Father, they had thrown Father, were defiling \nthe corpse, probably throwing it in the fire, going to burn it. I heard it, \nand the sound was kind of hollow, and I said, "No, that's from some of the \nfurniture." Mother and I pounced on Sasha and stopped him somehow, and calmed \nhim down.\n\nThe mob left somewhere around eight o'clock. They smashed open the door and \nwent into the apartment of the neighbors across from us. They were also\nArmenians, they had left for another city.\n\nThe father of the neighbor who was concealing us came and said, "Are you \ncrazy? Why are you hiding Armenians? Don't you now they're checking all the \napartments? They could kill you and them!" And to us :" . . . Come on, leave \nthis apartment!" We went down to the third floor, to some other neighbors'. At\nfirst the man didn't want to let us in, but then one of his sons asked him and\nhe relented. We stayed there until eleven o'clock at night. We heard the sound\nof motors. The neighbors said that it was armored personnel carriers. We went \ndownstairs. There was a light on in the room where we left Father. In the \nother rooms, as we found out later, all the chandeliers had been torn down. \nThey left only one bulb. The bulb was burning, which probably was a signal \nthey had agreed on because there was a light burning in every apartment in our\nMicrodistrict 3 where there had been a pogrom.\n\nWith the help of the soldiers we made it to the City Party Committee and were \nsaved. Our salvation--my mother's, my brother's, and mine,--was purely \naccidental, because, as we later found out from the neighbors, someone in the \ncrowd shouted that we had firearms up there. Well, we fought, but we were only\nable to save Mother. We couldn't save Father. We inflicted many injuries on \nthe bandits, some of them serious. But others came to take their places. We \nwere also wounded, there was blood, and we were scratched all over--we got our\nshare. It was a miracle we survived. We were saved by a miracle and the \ntroops. And if troops hadn't come to Sumgait, the slaughter would have been \neven greater: probably all the Armenians would have been victims of the \ngenocide.\n\nThrough an acquaintance at the City Party Committee I was able to contact the \nleadership of the military unit that was brought into the city, and at their \norders we were assigned special people to accompany us, experts. We went to '\npick up Father's corpse. We took it to the morgue. This was about two o'clock \nin the morning, it was already March 1, it was raining very hard and it was \nquite cold, and we were wearing only our suits. When my brother and I carried \nFather into the morgue we saw the burned and disfigured corpses. There were \nabout six burned people in there, and the small corpse of a burned child. It \nwas gruesome. I suffered a tremendous shock. There were about ten people \nthere, but the doctor on duty said that because of the numbers they were being\ntaken to Baku. There was a woman's corpse there too, she had been . . . well, \nthere was part of a body there . . . a hacked-off part of a woman's body. It \nwas something terrible. The morgue was guarded by the landing force . . . The \nchild that had been killed was only ten or twelve years old. It was impossible\nto tell if it was a boy or a girl because the corpse was burned. There was a \nman there, too, several men. You couldn't tell anything because their faces \nwere disfigured, they were in such awful condition...\n\nNow two and a half months have passed. Every day I recall with horror what \nhappened in the city of Sumgait. Every day: my father, and the death of my \nfather, and how we fought, and the people's sorrow, and especially the morgue.\n\nI still want to say that 70 years have passed since Soviet power was\nestablished, and up to the very last minute we could not conceive of what \nhappened  in Sumgait. It will go down in history.\n\nI'm particularly surprised that the mob wasn't even afraid of the troops. They\neven fought the soldiers. Many soldiers were wounded. The mob threw fuel \nmixtures onto the armored personnel carriers, setting them on fire. They \nweren't afraid. They were so sure of their impunity that they attacked our \ntroops. I saw the clashes on February 29 near the airline ticket office, right\nacross from our building. And that mob was fighting with the soldiers. The \ninhabitants of some of the buildings, also Azerbaijanis, threw rocks at the \nsoldiers from windows, balconies, even cinder blocks and glass tanks. They \nweren't afraid of them. I say they were sure of their impunity. When we were \nat the neighbors' and when they were robbing homes near the airline ticket \noffice I called the police at number 3-20-02 and said that they were robbing \nArmenian apartments and burning homes. And they told me that they knew that \nthey were being burned. During those days no one from the police department \ncame to anyone's aid. No one came to help us, either, to our home, even though\nperhaps they could have come and saved us.\n\nAs we later found out the mob was given free vodka and drugs, near the bus \nstation. Rocks were distributed in all parts of town to be thrown and used in \nfighting. So I think all of it was arranged in advance. They even knew in \nwhich buildings and apartments the Armenians lived, on which floors--they had\nlists, the bandits. You can tell that the "operation" was  planned in advance.\n\nThanks, of course, to our troops, to the country's leadership, and to the\nleadership of the Ministry of Defense for helping us, thanks to the Russian\npeople, because the majority of the troops were Russians, and the troops \nsuffered losses, too. I want to express this gratitude in the name of my \nfamily and in the name of all Armenians, and in the name of all Sumgait\nArmenians. For coming in time and averting terrible things: worse would\nhave happened if that mob had not been stopped on time.\n\nAt present an investigation is being conducted on the part of the USSR\nProcuracy. I want to say that those bandits should receive the severest\npossible punishment, because if they don't, the tragedy, the genocide, could \nhappen again. Everyone should see that the most severe punishment is meted\nout for such deeds.\n\nVery many bandits and hardened hooligans took part in the unrest, in the mass \ndisturbances. The mobs were huge. At present not all of them have been caught,\nvery few of them have been, I think, judging by the newspaper reports. There \nwere around 80 people near our building alone, that's how many people took \npart in the pogrom of our building all in all.\n\nThey should all receive the most severe punishment so that others see that \nretribution awaits those who perform such acts.\n\n   May 18, 1988\n   Yerevan\n\n		     - - - reference - - -\n\n[1] _The Sumgait Tragedy; Pogroms against Armenians in Soviet Azerbaijan,\n    Volume I, Eyewitness Accounts_, edited by Samuel Shahmuradian, forward by\n    Yelena Bonner, 1990, published by Aristide D.

To Andi,\n\nI have to disagree with you about the value of Israeli news sources. If you\nwant to know about events in Palestine it makes more sense to get the news\ndirectly from the source. EVERY news source is inherently biased to some\nextent and for various reasons, both intentional and otherwise. However, \nthe more sources relied upon the easier it is to see the "truth" and to discern \nthe bias. \n\nGo read or listen to some Israeli media. You will learn more news and more\nopinion about Israel and Palestine by doing so. Then you can form your own\nopinions and hopefully they will be more informed even if your views don't \nchange.
Dorin, of all the criticism of my post expressed on t.p.m., this one I accept.\nI regret that aspect of my post. It is my hope that the occupation will end (and\nthe accompanying loss of life) but I believe that stiff resistance can help to \nachieve that end. Despite what some have said on t.p.m., I think that there is \na point when losses are unacceptable. The strategy drove U.S. troops out of \nLebanon, at least.

True, but maybe not the worst possible - see Algeria.  \n\n\nThis was true (and I may add the adjective "stupid") until the Intifada.\nSince then, no serious Israeli leader (including Shamir) really thinks\nthe the occupied territories worth the trouble. The only question became\nthe question of price and other quantitative detail. The best thing the \nPalestinians can do for themselves these days is to stop the Intifada\nand try to live as normally as possible (I know, it's hard under occupation).\nOtherwise people might think that five years of stone throwing (as justified\nas it may be) has caused the Palestinians an irreversible damage that \nprevents them from running a normal state when the time comes. Currently \nit serves no purpose and it's just a waste of human life and economic\nresources.
Maybe he will. Maybe he is working for the secret Turkish service. You never \nknow. \n\n\nNo it is still called "you are full of shit"; even in the US.:)\n\n\nWell, now you have. Don't worry Turks do not turn to terrorist actions like\nArmenians have so you can be sure that you will not be killed. However, I \ndo not know about the torture part... Timucin sounds like a tough guy so \nwatch out. \n\n \nIf you are going to translate, you have to do it consistently. If you \nselectively translate things to serve your ugly purpose, people get \npisssssssssed offfffff. \n\nIn Ottoman times messengers were usually killed by cutting their heads off and\nsending it back to their country. But Ottoman empire no longer exists :(. \n(darn!)

Dorin,\nLet's not forget that the soldiers were killed not murdered. The\ndistinction is not trivial. Murder happens to innocent people, not people\nwhose line of work is to kill or be killed. It just so happened that these\nsoldiers, in the line of duty, were killed by the opposition. And\nresistance is different from terrorism. Certainly the athletes in Munich\nwere victims of terrorists (though some might call them freedom fighters).\nTheir deaths cannot be compared to those of soldiers who are killed by\nresistance fighters. Don't forget that it was the French Resistance to the\nNazi occupying forces which eventually succeeded in driving out the\nhostile occupiers in WWII. Diplomacy has not worked with Israel and the\nLebanese people are tired of being occupied! They are now turning to the\nonly option they see as viable. (Don't forget that it worked in driving\nout the US)\n\n-marc

I moved there from\nNovosibirsk. My son entered the Baku Nautical School, and so I transferred\nto Azerbaijan. Later I met someone and married him, and now my name is\nArutunian, my husband's name . . .\n\nThat there would be a massacre was not discussed openly, but there were hints \nand gibes, so to speak, at the Armenian people, and they were mocking the \nRussians, too. I was constantly aware of it at work, and not just this past \nyear. I couldn't find a definite place for myself in the pool at work because \nI, I'll just say it, couldn't steal, couldn't deceive, and couldn't be \ninvolved in bribe-taking. And when I asked for decent working conditions they \ntold me, "Leave, don't keep the others from working, you aren't cut out for \nthis kind of work." And at work and around all the time I would hear gibes at \nthe Armenians, like "The Turks had it right, they killed them all--the way\nthey've multiplied here they're making it hard for us to live," and "Things \nwill be just fine if we get rid of them all." "No problem, the Turks will \nhelp," they say, "if we ask them, they'll rid Armenia of Armenians in half an \nhour." Well that's the way it all was, but I never thought, of course that it \nwould spill over into a bloody tragedy, because you just couldn't imagine it. \nHere we've been living under the Soviet government for 70 years, and no one \neven considered such an idea possible.\n\nBut I had been forming my own opinions, and in the presence of authoritative \npeople I would often ask, "Where is this all leading, do people really not see\nwhat kind of situation is emerging here. The Russians are fleeing Sumgait, \nthere are very few of them left. Why is no one dealing with this, what's going\non?" And when it all happened on the 27th and 28th, it became clear that \neverything had been arranged by someone, because what else are you to make of \nit if the First Secretary of the City Party Committee is marching ahead of the\ndemonstration with an Azerbaijani flag? I wouldn't be saying this now if I \nhadn't received personal confirmation from him later. Because when we were \nunder guard in the SK club on the 1st, he came to the club, that Muslimzade. \nThe women told me, "There he is, there he is, that's Muslimzade." I didn't \nbelieve the rumors that he had carried an Azerbaijani flag. I thought that \nthey were just false rumors. I went over to him and said, "Are you the First \nSecretary of our City Party Committee?" He answers me, "Yes." And I ask him, \n"Tell me, did you really march ahead of that gang carrying an Azerbaijani \nflag, and behind you they were carrying denigrating signs, I don't know \nexactly what they said, but there was mention of Armenian blood?" And he tells\nme, "Yes, I was there, but I tried to dissuade them from it." Then I asked him\nanother question: "And where were you when they were burning and slaughtering \nus? And he said, "I. . . We didn't know what to do, we didn't know, we didn't \nanticipate that that would happen in Sumgait."\n\nComrade Mamedov, the First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the \nAzerbaijani SSR, answered the same question for me: "No, we actually didn't \nanticipate the slaughter in Sumgait. At that time we were trying to contain \nthe crowd of 45,000 in Baku that was preparing for a massacre." Those are his \nexact words, the ones he said in the office of the Council of Ministers of the\nArmenian SSR.\n\nAnd now, about the events themselves. Of course it's painful to discuss them, \nbecause it may seem that it's not true to someone else. Various rumors \nconcerning what happened are making the rounds: some are true, others aren't. \nBut unfortunately there are more true ones than false, because it was so \nhorrible: in our age, here in the space age, the age of science, the age of\nprogress, I don't know, if someone had told me this story, if I were living in\nor around Moscow, I wouldn't have believed it. Why not? Because it was really \na genocide, it was a massacre. That's genuinely what it was.\n\nFor example, on that day, the 28th--I didn't know about the 27th because my \nhusband and I were both sick, both of us had the flu, and we were in bed--on \nthe 28th our neighbor comes to our place and says, "You're in bed? You don't \nknow anything about it? There was a demonstration in town, and after it they \nwere overturning Armenian cars and burning them. They were looking into cars \nand asking, 'Are you an Armenian?' If they answered in Armenian, then they \nturned the car over and burned it." This isn't made up, the wife of the Senior\nInvestigator of the Baku Ministry of Internal Affairs told us. He was \nreturning home from his dacha with his wife, Raisa Sevastyanova, she's my \nneighbor. She immediately came and told LIS that they had landed right in the \nmiddle of it, I don't know what to call it, the cavalcade of automobiles they \nwere stopping. He answered in Azerbaijani, they let them go, but they made him\nhonk the horn, they were kicking up a fracas. We didn't even believe it, and \nI said, "Certainly that didn't happen, how can that be?" And she said, \n"Muslimzade was leading the crowd, and the Sputnik store was completely\nsmashed because most of the salespeople there are Armenians. And when he saw \nthat they had started breaking the glass in that store, he said, "Don't break \nthe shop windows, don't destroy state property, but do whatever else you want.\n" I didn't hear this with my own two ears, but it is a fact that the store was\ntorn up and the director of the store was beaten for employing Armenians \nalthough he's an Azerbaijani.\n\nWhile we were talking, all of a sudden right across from us . . . Sevastyanova\nis the first to look out the window and say, "Look, there's a crowd out \nthere." And sure enough, when we looked out there we saw that the crowd had \nalready started wrecking the neighboring building. There was an Armenian \nfamily there, a woman and two girls. They lived across from us. I'm sorry, I \ndon't know the building number or the people's names, since we were in my \nhusband's apartment, in Microdistrict 8, and I lived in Microdistrict No. 3. \nThere was awful looting going on there at the time, the most hideous things \nwere going on there then. One building there, ours, was attacked twice, once \nwasn't enough for them. They returned to the places where they hadn't finished\nthe Armenians off. If an Azerbaijani family dared to conceal Armenians, they \nbeat the Azerbaijanis too. They also beat Russians, if it was Russians doing \nthe hiding. Because there were Russians among them, they said so on \ntelevision, there were people of various nationalities. But they didn't tell \nus why there were people of different nationalities. Because they wouldn't \nhave touched the Azerbaijanis if they hadn't dared to stick up for the \nArmenians and give them temporary shelter in their homes.\n\nAt the time I saw this from the window I was there, Sevastyanova was there, \nand so was my husband. We went out onto the balcony and saw a television fly \noff a balcony. All kinds of things, even a sofa. Then, when it was all down \nthere, they burned it up. Then we saw the crowd, and they were all oohing. At \nfirst I couldn't figure out what was happening. And later I told my husband, \n"Lendrush, l think they're beating someone out there." And he answered, "I \ndon't know, could be." Suddenly the crowd separated for a moment, and I saw \nit, and Raisa Sevastyanova saw it too. My husband had turned the other way, \nhe didn't see it. I saw a naked girl with her hair down. They were dragging \nher. She kept falling because they were pushing her and kicking her. She fell \ndown, it was muddy there, and later other witnesses who saw it from their \nbalconies told us, they seized her by the hair and dragged her a couple of \nblocks, as far as the mortgage bank, that's a good block and a half or two \nfrom here. I know this for sure because I saw it myself.\n\nThen the crowd rushed toward our building. We were standing there, and you can\nof course imagine what we were feeling. Were they going to kill us or not? And\nI also had the awful thought that they might torment me the way they tormented\nthat woman, because I had just seen that.\n\nI asked my husband. I gave him an axe and said, "You kill me first, and then \nlet them do what they want with the corpse." But our neighbors, it's true, \ndefended us, they said, "There aren't any Armenians in our entryway, go away, \nonly Muslims live here." Disaster missed us that time.\n\nBut at two o'clock in the morning a crowd of about 15 people, approximately, \ncame back to our place. My husband was already asleep. He can sleep when he's \nupset about something, but I can't. I was standing, running from balcony to \nbalcony. Our power was out, I don't remember for how long, but it was as \nthough it had been deliberately turned off. There were no lights whatsoever, \nand I was glad, of course. I thought it was better that way. But then I look \nand the crowd is at our balcony. This was at 2:15 in the morning. The first \ntime they were at our building it was 6:30, and now it was 2:15 in the \nmorning. But I never thought that that old woman on the first floor, the \nAzerbaijani, was awake and watching out, there were human beings among them \ntoo. So she goes out with a pail of garbage, as though she needed to be taking\ngarbage out at two o'clock in the morning. She used it as a pretext and went \ntoward those young people. They really were youngsters. From my balcony you \ncould see perfectly that they were young Azerbaijani boys. They spoke \nAzerbaijani. And when they came up to her she said, "What do you want?" And \nthey answered, "We want the Armenian family that lives here" [pointing toward \nthe second floor with their hands]. She says, "I already told you, we don't \nhave any Armenians here, now leave, do you hear, this is an old Muslim woman \ntalking to you," and grabbed the hand of one boy who was trying to walk around\nher and enter the building anyway and started pushing him away. And so they \nseemed to listen to her. They were all very young, they started apologizing \nand left. That was the second time death was at our door.\n\nI forgot to mention about one other apartment, a man named Rubik lives there, \nI don't know him really, I knew his daughter, I mean I saw her around, but we \nreally didn't know them. But I do know that that guy who lives on the fourth \nfloor across from our entryway went to Chernobyl and worked there for eight \nmonths, to earn money. Can you imagine what that means? He risked his life to \nearn X amount of money in order to better his family. He bought new furniture \nand was getting ready to give his daughter's hand in marriage, but, alas,\neverything was ruined by those creeps and scoundrels. They threw everything \nout the windows, and the rest we saw from our balcony: how the neighbors on \nthe left and right ran into the apartment and carried off everything that \nhadn't already been smashed or taken. What is one to think of that? It means \nthat the parents in those families were in on it too. Unfortunately I came to \nbe of the opinion that it was all organized and that everything had been \nforeseen in advance: both the beating of the Armenians and the stripping of \napartments. Something on the order of "We'll move the Armenians out and take \nover their apartments."\n\nI have worked honestly my whole life, you can check everything about me. I \ncame as a patriot from China, waited for nights on end in front of the \nConsulate General of the USSR, I came to my homeland as a patriot because I \nknew that the Party and the Komsomol were holy things. But when I saw in \nSumgait that there wasn't anything holy about them, that Party membership was \nbought, that Komsomol members joined only for personal gain, that there were \nno ideals, no ideas, God save me, everything was being bought and sold, I saw \nall of it and understood how they could allow that crap to go on like it did.\n\nI can't talk any more about it . . . the image of that beating . . . When I\nwent out of my own apartment--they picked us up under Soviet Army guard, they \nhad arrived from all over to suppress that gang--not only Armenians, but some \nRussian families and their children, too, came out of their apartments and\njoined us, because no normal person who had seen that could stay there with \nthe situation the way it was. And what's interesting is that when we left on \nthe buses I rode and thought that at least one group of people, for sure \npeople would basically rise to the situation, would have some compassion for \nthe Armenians, would somehow understand the injustice of what was done. But \nhaving analyzed and weighed the whole thing, once I calmed down, having \nthought it all through, I came to a conclusion that is shared by many people. \nIf a lot of Azerbaijanis didn't want their Armenian neighbors to be killed, \nand that basically depended on that Muslimzade--he said that he had wanted to \ncalm them down--then is it possible that he didn't have people at hand to whom\nhe could whisper at the last minute, "Go and announce it on television: \nCitizens of Sumgait! Take what you can into your hands, let's protect our \nneighbors from this massacre?" Those crowds weren't such that there was no \ncontrolling them. Basically they were unarmed. They didn't have firearms, \nmostly they had knives, they had all kinds of metal parts, like armature \nshafts, sharpened at the ends, special rocks, different to a degree that we \nnoticed them: there aren't rocks like those in Sumgait soils, they were \nbrought from somewhere, as though it were all specially planned. So as I was \nsaying, I weighed it all out and if any of our neighbors had wanted to defend \nus, why wasn't it arranged? It means that the government didn't want to do \nit. When the crowd was moving from the City Party Committee to the Sputnik, \nwhat, there was no way of informing Baku? No, there was no way, it turns out!\nThe crowd was doing violence in our microdistrict. I won't mention the things \nI didn't see myself, I'll only talk about the things I myself witnessed. They \nwere in Microdistrict 8 beginning at 6 o'clock in the evening, when I saw them\nfrom the other building, and they were somewhere else until mid-night or one \no'clock in the morning, because at 2:15 they came back to our building. They\nhadn't completely finished making their predatory rounds of Microdistrict 8. \nWhen they returned to our building I told my husband, "Lendrush, now the \npolice are probably going to come, my God, now the authorities are probably \ngoing to find out and come to our aid." Well, alas, no, there were to be no \nauthorities, not a single policeman, not a single fireman, not a single \nambulance came while they were raging, as it turns out, as we later found out,\nbeginning on the Might of the 27th. There were dead people, ruined apartments,\nand burned autos: one car near the bus station, it was burned and overturned, \nit was probably there about four days, everyone saw it and what went on in \nBlock 45! Those who live there know, they saw from their balconies how they \nattacked the soldiers in the buses, how they beat those poor, unarmed\nsoldiers, and how on that square, I can't remember the name of it, where there\nis that fork coming from the bus station, that intersection, now I'm upset and\nI can't think of the name . . . there's a tall building there, a 9-story, and \nfrom the balconies there people saw that butchery, when the poor soldiers, \nwearing only helmets, with shields and those unfortunate clubs, moved against \nthat mob. And when they fell, those 12-to 14-year-old boys ran up and using \nstones, big heavy stones, beat them to death on their heads. Who could have \nguessed that something like that could happen in the Soviet Union and under \nthe Soviet government? The upshot is that this republic has not been under \nSoviet control for a long time, but no one wanted to pay any attention or get \ninvolved.\n\nIf you were to go and ask at my work many people would confirm that I tell the\ntruth, I've been struggling for truth for five years there already, the five \nyears that I worked at the Azerbaijani railroad. Some people there considered \nme a demagogue, others who knows what; some think I'm an adventure seeker, and\nsome, a prankster. But I wanted everything to be right, I would become\noutraged: how can this be, why is it people treat one another this way on a \nSoviet railroad, as though the Azerbaijani railroad were Azerbaijani property,\nor the property of some magnate, or some "mafia": If I want to, I'll get you \nout of here; If I want to, I'll get rid of you; If I want to, I'll do \nsomething else? And there's a black market price for everything, in the most \nbrazen way: a coach to Moscow costs so much, a coach on a local train costs so\nmuch. Once when I was complaining to the head of the conductor's pool, he had \nthe nerve to tell me, maybe you won't even believe this, but this, I'm afraid,\nI heard with my own ears: "Tatyana, just how long can you fight for something\nthat you know will never have any effect? You're alone against everyone, so \ninstead why don't you give more money to the chief conductor, and everything \nwill go fine for you." I started to cry, turned, and left. What else could I \ndo, where else could I go to complain? I realized that everything was useless.\nAnd the root of the whole thing is that it all goes on and no one wants to see\nit. I filed a written complaint, and they ground it into dust, they destroyed \nit, I still have a copy, but what's the use? When the General Procuracy got \ninvolved with the investigation of the bloody Sumgait affair, in addition to \nthe information about what I saw, what I was a witness to, I gave testimony \nabout the mafia at the railroad. They accepted my petition, but I don't know \nif they're going to pursue it or not. Because, you'll excuse me, I no longer \nbelieve in the things I aspired to, the things I believed in before: It's all \ndead. They just spit on my soul, stomped on everything, physically, and most \nimportant, spiritually, because you can lose belongings, that's nonsense, that\nall comes with time, but when your soul is spit upon and when the best in \nyou--your beliefs--are destroyed, it can be very difficult to restore them...\n\nI want to tell of one incident. I just don't know, at the time I was in such a\nstate that I didn't even take minor things into account. Here is an example.\nOf course, it's not a minor one. My neighbor, Raisa Sevastyanova, she has a\nson, Valery, who is in the 9th grade in a school in Microdistrict 8. A boy,\nVitaly [Danielian], I don't know his last name, goes to school with him, or\nrather, went to school with him. I was just sitting in an apartment trying to\nmake a phone call to Moscow . . . Oh yes, and there's one important detail:\nWhen the massacre began, for two to three hours the phones weren't working in \nArmenian apartments, and later, in several Russian and Azerbaijani apartments.\nBut the fact of the matter is that service was shut off, you could not call \nanywhere. Why? Again, it means it was all planned. How come service is cut off\nfor no reason? And the lights went off. And those brats were raging as they\nliked They weren't afraid, they ran about freely, they that no one would slap \ntheir hands and no one would dare to stop them.  They knew it.\n\nNow I'm going to tell about the incident. So this little Vitaly, Vitalik, an\nArmenian boy, went to school with Valery; they were in the same class. \nAccording to what Valery and his neighbor pal said--at the time I was in the\nsame apartment as they were, I sat at the phone waiting for the call to be put\nthrough--a mob attacked the building where Vitalik lived. So Valery ran to\nhis mother and said, "Mamma, please let me go to Vitalik's, what if they kill\nhim? Maybe he's still alive, maybe we can bring him here and save him somehow.\n. . . He's a nice guy, we all like him, he's a good person, he's smart." His \nmother wouldn't let him go. In tears, she says, "Valery, you can't go because \nI am afraid." He says, "Mamma, we can get around the crowd. We'll just watch, \njust have a look." They made it through. I don't know, I think Vitalik's\nparents lived in Microdistrict No. 1, and when they got there, they made a \nsuperficial deduction. Knowing that balconies and doors were being broken \neverywhere, that you could see from the street which were the Armenian \napartments in the building, they went here and there and looked, and saw that \nthe windows were intact, and so they calmed down. But even though the windows \nin that apartment were not broken, everything inside was totally smashed, and \nVitalik lay there with a broken skull, and his mother and father had already \nbeen murdered. Little Vitalik didn't even know they were dead. So two weeks \nago, I don't know, he was in critical condition, no, maybe it was longer: we \nleft Sumgait on March 20, spent some time in Moscow, and then we came to \nYerevan. So it's been about a month already; it's so hard to keep all this \nstraight. So Valery, the next day, when he found out that Vitalik's family has\nbeen killed and Vitalik was ling in the Semashko Hospital in Baku, Valery and\nhis classmates got together and went to visit him. But they wouldn't admit \nthem, telling them that he was in critical condition and that he was still in \na coma. They cried and left, having also found out that the girl I saw being \nkicked and dragged was in that hospital too. As it turns out she was brought \nthere in serious condition, but at least she was alive at the time . . .\n\nWhen we got to the SK club we would see first one friend and then another, \nthrow ourselves into their arms and kiss them, because you had wondered if \nthese friends were alive or not, if those friends were alive or not  . . . And\nwhen you saw them you were so glad to find out that the family had lived! When\nyou saw people you heard things that made your hair stand on end.\n\nIf you publish everything that happened it will be a hideous book. A book of \nthings it is even difficult to believe. And those two girls who were raped \nwere entirely black and blue, the ones at the SK, they know I'm not lying, \nthat girlfriend came up to one of them and said, "What happened?" and she \nbared her breasts, and they were completely covered in cigarette burns . . . \nthose rogues had put cigarettes out on her breasts. After something like that \nI don't know how you can live in a city and look at the people in it.\n\nNow . . . When we stayed at the military unit for a while, they provided,\nwell, basic conditions for us there. The military unit is located in Nasosny,\nsome six miles from Sumgait. And living there we met with a larger group\nof people. There were about 1,600 people at the unit. You know, there was a\npoint when I couldn't even go outside because if you went outside you saw\nso much heartbreak around you. And when you hear the false rumors . . .\n\nYes, by the way, false rumors were spread in Sumgait saying that the Armenians\naround Yerevan had destroyed Azerbaijani villages and razed them to the ground\nwith bulldozers. I didn't know whether to believe it or not. And people who \ndon't know any better get the idea that it was all done in revenge. But when \nI arrived in Armenia and was in Spitak, and in Spitak all those villages are \nnot only intact, but at that time had even been protected just in case, they \nwere guarded, they got better food than did the inhabitants of Spitak. Not a \nsingle person there died, and no one is planning to harm them. Around Yerevan \nall the villages are safe and unharmed, and the Armenians didn't attack \nanyone. But actually, after an evil of the magnitude suffered in Sumgait there\ncould have been a feeling of vengefulness, but no one acted on it. And I don't\nknow why you sometimes hear accusations to the effect that the Armenians are \nguilty, that it is they who organized it. Rumors like that are being spread in\nAzerbaijan. And if one old person says it and ten young ones hear it, they not\nonly perceive it with their minds, but with their hearts, too. To them it \nseems that the older person is telling the truth. For example, one says; "Did \nyou know that out of 31 people killed (by the way, originally they said 31 \npeople, but later they found a 32nd), 30 were Azerbaijani and one was an \nArmenian?"\n\nOf course I'm upset, but it's utterly impossible to discuss such things and\nnot become upset. Sometimes l forget things, but I know I want to return to\nthe time when we were in the SK club across from the City Party Committee.\nWhen I saw Muslimzade in the SK club building I went to him to ask because I \ncouldn't believe that he had marched in the front carrying a banner. I already\nmentioned this, and if I repeat anything, please excuse me. I asked him, "Why \ndid you do that and why are you here now, why did you come here? To laugh at \nthese women who are strewn about on the floor?" The overcrowding there was \ntremendous, it was completely unsanitary, and several of the children were\nalready sick. It's true the troops tried to make it livable for us. They \ncooked for us on their field stoves and provided us with wonderful food, but \nthe thing is that their main job was to ferret out the gang that was still at \nit everywhere, that was continuing its sordid affairs everywhere. Plus they \nwere never given any direct orders, they didn't know what they were authorized\nto do and not to do. And it was only on March 8 at five o'clock in the evening\nthat Krayev himself, the Lieutenant General, the City Commandant of Sumgait, \nwas given full authority and told everyone over a microphone from an armored \npersonnel carrier that now he could do what he wanted to do, as his heart \nadvised him, and relocate people to the military unit.\n\nBut that's not what I want to talk about now. Muslimzade, characteristically, \ntried to get me out of the SK building and take me to the City Party\nCommittee, which is across the square from the club. He took me by the\nhand and said, "Citizen, don't worry, we'll go and have a talk in my office.\nI told him, "No, after everything you've done, I don't believe one iota of \nwhat you say. If I go to the City Party Committee I'll disappear, and the \ntraces of me will disappear too. Because you can't stand it when . . . " Oh \nyes, and there was another interesting detail from that meeting. It was even \nvery funny, although at the time I wasn't up to laughing. He was in a nice, \nexpensive hat, and so as to put him to shame, so to speak, I said, "Oh, why \ndid you come here all duded up like a London dandy, you smell of good perfume,\nyou're in your starched shirt, and you have your expensive hat on. You came\nto ridicule the poor women and children who are lying on the floor, who are\nalready getting sick, whose relatives have died. Did you come to laugh at\nthem?" And the one who was accompanying him, an Azerbaijani, I don't know who \nhe was or what his title was, he quickly snatched the hat off Muslimzade's head \nand hid it. Then I said, "My God! We're not marauders. We're not you! We \ndidn't come to you with the intention of stealing!" "Well kill me, kill me!" \nMuslimzade says to me, "But I'm not guilty . . . kill me, kill me, but I'm not\nguilty." And I say, "OK, fine, you're not guilty, have it your way. But give \nus an answer, we're asking you: Where were you when they were torturing and \nraping those poor women, when they were killing the children, burning things, \ncarrying on outrageously, and wrecking all those apartments? Where were you \nthen?" "You know, we didn't expect it, we did not know what to do, we didn't \nanticipate that something like that would happen in Sumgait." I started \nlaughing and said, "It's truly funny." He says, "What could I do? We didn't \nknow what to do." And I say, "I'm sorry, but it'll be ridiculous if I tell \nyou: The First Secretary of the City Party Committee shouldn't march out in \nfront with a banner; he should fall down so that the gang would have to cross \nover his dead body. That's what you should have done. That's the way it was \nduring the war. Not a single party committee secretary compromised himself;\neither he died or he led people into battle. And what did you do? You ran \naway, you left, you hid, you marched with a flag, because you were afraid, \nexcuse my language, you feared for your own damned hide. And when we ask you, \nyou tell us that you got confused and you ask me what you could have done? \nThat's right," I told him, "the City party committee got confused, all the \nparty committees got confused, the police got confused,. Baku got confused, \nthey all lay in a faint for two weeks, and the gang ran the show with \nimpunity. And if it weren't for the troops it wouldn't have been just two \ndays, there wouldn't be a single Armenian left in Sumgait for sure, they would \nhave finished their bloody affair, because they brazenly went up to some \nRussians, too, the ones who tried to say something to them, and they told \nthem, 'As soon as we finish with the Armenians we'll come after you, too."\n\nAnd by the way, there was a colonel, who took us to the military unit. He was\nthe one with the light blue collar tabs who flew in and two hours later\narrived on an armored personnel carrier when we were at the  SK and took us to\nthe military unit and who later started moving us from the military unit. We \nasked him, "What? How? What will come of us?" He openly said, "You know, for \nus the main thing now is to catch that gang. We'll finish that quickly. You'll\nstay at the military unit for the time being, and we'll decide later." The \nGeneral Procuracy of the USSR arrived, it consists of investigators from all \ncities. There were some from Stavropol, from everywhere, just everywhere, because \nthe affair was truly frightful. About this, by the way, Comrade Katusev spoke;\nas everyone knows, he's the First Deputy General Procurator of the USSR. When \nhe gave us a speech from the armored personnel carrier at the military unit, \nby the way, he told us the honest truth, because he couldn't not say it, \nbecause he was still experiencing his first impressions of what he had seen, \nand he said, "There was Afghanistan; and it was bad, but Sumgait--it's\nhorrible! And the people who dared to do such a thing will be severely \npunished, in accordance with our laws." And that's a quote. Then one mother \nthrows herself at him--her two sons had died before her very eyes--and says,\n"Who will return my sons? Who is going to punish the [culprits]?" They tried \nto calm her down, and he said, "In order for us to conduct a proper \ninvestigation, in order that not a single scoundrel avoid responsibility, you \nmust help us, because we don't know, maybe there was someone else in the gang \nwho is now being concealed in homes, and maybe the neighbors know, maybe \nsomeone saw something. Don't be afraid, write about it in detail. So that \nyou're not afraid . . . Everyone knows that many of you are afraid, having \nlived through such horrors, they think that if they write the whole truth \nabout, let's say, their neighbor or someone else, that they will seek revenge \nlater. We're going to do it like this: We're going to set up an urn and you \ncan throw what you write in there. We don't need to know who wrote it. The \nnames of the people who write won't be made public, but we need all the\ninformation. Let each and every one not be afraid, let each write what is \nnecessary, who they saw in that gang, who made threats or shouted threatening \ngibes about the Armenians . . . You must describe all of these people and put \nthe information into the urn."\n\nTwo soldiers and a major guarded the urn. And, sure enough, many people, \npeople who didn't even want to write . . .I know one woman who asked me, she \ncame up and said, "You, as a Russian, the same thing won't happen to you as \nwill happen to me. So please . . . I'll give you the information, and you \nplease write it down for me." So she was afraid, and there were a lot like\nher . . . But later, after Katusev made his speech, she sat and wrote down\neverything she knew. And we threw it all into the urn. Now we don't know if \nit will be of any use. For a factual picture will emerge from all that \ninformation. One person can lie, but thousands can't lie, thousands simply \ncan't lie. You have to agree with that, a fact is a fact. Why, for example, \nshould someone say that black is white if it is really black?\n\n   The First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Azerbaijani\nSSR, Mamedov, as I said, was in Yerevan. My husband and I were at the Council \nof Ministers of the Armenian SSR and found out that Mamedov was present, the \none who had come to convince the people of Sumgait to  return to their \nprevious dwellings, to their old apartments. We asked for a meeting with him, \nand it was granted. When we went to see him he tried to behave properly, very \npolitely, delicately, but . . . when the truth was told right to his face and \nwhen I asked him some of the same questions I had asked Muslimzade, "Where were\nyou personally when they were beating us? Now you're trying to convince us to \nreturn, why didn't you think at the time that they were slaughtering us where \nit was all leading?" he says, "You're telling the truth. Let's not mince \nwords. You've told me right to my face, and I'll tell you straight. I'll tell \nyou the pure truth. I was gotten out of bed in the evening, the whole \ngovernment was up, including me, and we were restraining a crowd of about \n45,000 in Baku. But we never expected that in a city like Sumgait, with its \nfine international record, such a thing could happen. We expected it in Baku."\nI say, "So that means you expected it all the same? Why were you expecting \nit?" And he says, "You know, it just happened that way. We were expecting it \nin Baku, we were trying to restrain it, but in Sumgait . . . " I say, "Fine, \nyou didn't know for the first three or four hours, but then you should have \nknown. Why did no one help us?" And he says, "Well, OK, we didn't know what to\ndo" and things like that. Basically it was the same story I got from \nMuslimzade. Later, when he said, "You go on back, the situation in Sumgait is \nfavorable now, everything is fine, the Armenians are friendly with the \nAzerbaijanis . . . " To this l answered, "You know what . . . I'm speaking \nwith you as a [member of a] neutral nation . . . I have never argued with \nArmenians or with Azerbaijanis and I was an eyewitness . . . You tell me, \nplease, Comrade Mamedov, " I asked him, "What would you say about this\nhonestly, if you were being completely frank with us?" Then he said, "Yes, I \nadmit that I am honestly ashamed, shame on the entire Azerbaijani nation, we \nhave disgraced ourselves not only before the entire Soviet Union, but before \nthe whole world. Because now the Voice of America and all the other foreign \nradio stations of various hues are branding us with all kinds of rumors, too."\nAnd I say, "There's nothing to add to what really happened. I don't think it's\npossible to add anything more awful." He says, "Yes, I agree with you, I \nunderstand your pain, it is truly an unfortunate occurrence." I repeat that he\nsaid "unfortunate occurrence." And then he suddenly remembered himself, what \nhe was saying--he had a pen in his hands, he was fidgeting with it nervously--\nand said, "Oh, excuse me, a tragedy, really . . . " I take this to mean that \nhe really thinks it's an "unfortunate occurrence." "And of course," he says, \n"I understand that having gone through all this you can't return to Sumgait, \nbut it's necessary to cool down and realize that all those people are being \ntried." And he even gave a detail, which, I don't know if it matters or not, \nthat 160 policemen were being tried. Specifically in relation to that bloody \naffair.\n\nYes, by the way, there is another good detail, how I was set up at work in\nBaku after the events. I went to an undergarment plant, there was an \nAzerbaijani working there, and suddenly she tells me, "What, they didn't\nnail your husband? They screwed up." I was floored, I hadn't imagined that\nanyone in Baku, too, could say something like that. Well after that I went up\nto see . . . to my office, I needed to find out about those days, what was\ngoing to happen with them, how they were going to put down those days from \nFebruary 29 to March 10 . . . and the administrator told me, "I don't know, \nTatyana, go to the head of the conductors' pool. Be grateful if they don't \nput it down as unexcused absence." I was really discouraged by this. They all \nknow that we were but a hair away from death and barely survived, and here \nthey're telling me that I was skipping work, as though I was off enjoying \nmyself somewhere. I went to the office of the chief of the pool, his last name\nis Rasulov, and he's had that position for many years. Incidentally, he's a \nParty member, and is a big man in town. And suddenly, when I went to him and \nsaid, "Comrade Rasulov, this is the way it was . . . " He looked at me askance\nand said, "And why are you"--he knows me by my previous last name--"why did\nyou get wrapped up in this mess?" I say, "What do you mean, why did I get \nwrapped up in this mess? My husband's an Armenian," I tell him, "I have an \nArmenian last name." And he screwed up his face, made a kind of a grimace, as \nthough he had eaten something sour, and said, "I didn't expect that you would\n. . . " What did he mean by that? And "how" should he behave, the chief of the\npool, a man who supervises 1,700 workers? Now, it's true, there was a \nreduction, but for sure there are still 1,200 conductors working for him. And \nif someone who supervises a staff that size says things like that, then what \ncan you expect from a simple, uneducated, politically unsophisticated person?!\nHe's going to believe any and all rumors, that the Armenians are like this, \nthe Armenians are like that, and so on . . .\n\nBy the way, that Mamedov--now I'm going back to Mamedov's office when I asked \nhim "Are you really going to guarantee the safety of our lives if we return \nto Sumgait?" he answered, "Yes, you know, I would guarantee them . . . I don't\nwant to take on too much, I would guarantee them firmly for 50 years. But I \nwon't guarantee them for longer than 50 years." I say, "So you've got another\nthing like that planned for 50 years from  now? So they'll be quiet and then \nin another 50 years it'll happen again?!" I couldn't contain myself any more,\nand I also told him, "And how did it get to that point, certainly you knew\nabout it, how they were treating the Russians, for example, in Baku and in \nSumgait, how they were hounded from their jobs? Certainly you received\ncomplaints, I wrote some myself. Why did no one respond to them? Why did \neveryone ignore what was going on? Didn't you prepare people for this by the \nway you treated them?" And he says, "You know, you're finally starting to \ninsult me!" He threw his pen on the desk. "Maybe now you'll say I'm a \nscoundrel too?" I say, "You know, I'm not talking about you because I don't \nknow. But about the ones who I do know I can say with conviction, yes, that \ncomrade was involved in this, that, and that, because I know for certain.\n"Well anyway he assured us that here, in Yerevan, there were false rumors, \nthat 3,000 Sumgait Armenians were here, and 15,000 were in Sumgait and had \ngotten back to work. Everyone was working, he said, and life was very good. \n"We drove about the town ourselves, Comrade Arutiunian [First Secretary of \nthe Communist Party of Armenia SSR] came from the Council of Ministers of \nArmenian, he came and brought information showing that everything was fine in\nSumgait." When I asked Mamedov how he had reached that conclusion he said, '\n"Well, I walked down the street." And I said, "Walking down the street in any \ncity, even if I were to go to New York, I would never understand the situation\nbecause I would be a guest, I don't have any contact with people, but if you \nspend 10 days among some blue-collar workers in such a way that they didn't \nknow you were the First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers, you'd \nhear something quite different." I told him, for example, that I drew my \nconclusion when we left the military unit to look at our apartments. They took\nus all in turns to pick things up, since people had fled to the military unit;\nthey got on the bus just to save themselves as soon as possible. How are the \nneighbors in the microdistrict, how will they view us, what do they think? I \nthought maybe that in fact it wasn't something general, of a mass nature, some\nanti-national something. And when that bus took us to our building, because it\nwas the same bus, while we were going up to our apartment, an armed soldier \naccompanied us. What does that say? It speaks of the fact that if everything \nthere were fine, why do we need to have soldiers go there and come back with\nus, going from apartment to apartment? And in fact, especially with the young \npeople, you could sense the delight at our misfortune, the grins, and they \nwere making comments, too. And that was in the presence of troops, when police\ndetachments were in the microdistricts and armored personnel carriers and \ntanks were passing by. And if people are taking such malicious delight when \nthe situation is like that, then what is it going to be like when they \nwithdraw protection from the city altogether? There will be more outrages, of \ncourse, perhaps not organized, but in the alleys . . .\n\n  April 20, 1988\n  Yerevan\n\n		     - - - reference - - -\n\n[1] _The Sumgait Tragedy; Pogroms against Armenians in Soviet Azerbaijan,\n    Volume I, Eyewitness Accounts_, edited by Samuel Shahmuradian, forward by\n    Yelena Bonner, 1990, published by Aristide D.

It is nonsense, Danny, if you can refute it with proof. If you are citing your\nexperience then you should have been there in the 1940's (the article is\ncomparing the condition then with that now).\n\nOtherwise, it is you who is trying to change the facts.

Chris, solid job at discussing the inherent Nazism in Mr. Davidsson's post.\nOddly, he has posted an address for hate mail, which I think we should\nall utilize.  And Elias,\n\nWie nur dem Koph nicht alle Hoffnung schwindet,\nDer immerfort an schalem Zeuge klebt?
Someone else said something similar.  I will not comment on the\nvalue or lack of value of Elias's "proposal".  I just want to say\nthat it is very distressing that at least two people here are\nprofoundly ignorant of Nazi racial doctrine.  They were NOT\nlike Elias's idea, they were more like the opposite.  \n\nNazis believed in racial purity, not racial assimilation.  An \ninstructive example is the Nazi attitude to Gypsies.  According to \nNazi theoreticians, Gypsies were an Aryan race.  They were persecuted,\nand in huge numbers murdered, because most European Gypies were\nconsidered not pure Gypsies but "mongrels" formed from the pure Gypsy \nrace and other undesirable races.  This was the key difference between \nthe theoretical approach to Jews and Gypsies, by the way.  It is also \ntrue that towards the end of WWII even the "purist" Gypsies were \nhunted down as the theory was forgotten.

"In fact we  helped Greece. Because  we prevented\nGreece, the cradle of democracy, from losing face before European\ncountries by forcing the Greek  government to recognize our legal\nrights."\n\nOn Turco-Greek relations, he pointed  out that both countries are\npredestined  to live  in  peace for  geographical and  historical\nreasons and said  that Turkey and Greece must  resist the foreign\npowers  who  are  trying  to   create  a  rift  between  them  by\ncooperating, adding  that in  Turkey he  observed that  there was\nwill to improve relations with Greece.\n\nNEWSPOT, January 1993\n\n\nMACEDONIAN HUMAN RIGHTS ACTIVISTS TO FACE TRIAL IN GREECE.\n\nTwo ethnic Macedonian  human rights activists will  face trial in\nAthens for alleged crimes against the Greek state, according to a\nCourt Summons (No. 5445) obtained by MILS.\n\n  Hristos  Sideropoulos and  Tashko Bulev  (or Anastasios  Bulis)\nhave been charged under Greek criminal law for making comments in\nan Athenian magazine.\n\n  Sideropoulos and  Bulev gave an  interview to the  Greek weekly\nmagazine  "ENA"  on  March  11,  1992,  and  said  that  they  as\nMacedonians were  denied basic human  rights in Greece  and would\nfield  an ethnic  Macedonian  candidate for  the up-coming  Greek\ngeneral election.\n\n  Bulev said in the interview: "I am not Greek, I am Macedonian."\nSideropoulos said  in the  article that "Greece  should recognise\nMacedonia.  The  allegations  regarding  territorial  aspirations\nagainst  Greece are  tales... We  are in  a panic  to secure  the\nborder, at  a time when the  borders and barriers within  the EEC\nare falling."\n\n  The  main  charge  against  the two,  according  to  the  court\nsummons,  was   that  "they  have   spread...intentionally  false\ninformation  which  might  create   unrest  and  fear  among  the\ncitizens,  and  might affect  the  public  security or  harm  the\ninternational interests of the country (Greece)."\n\n  The  Greek  state  does  not   recognise  the  existence  of  a\nMacedonian ethnicity. There are believed to be between 350,000 to\n1,000,000  ethnic  Macedonians   living  within  Greece,  largely\nconcentrated in the north. It is  a crime against the Greek state\nif anyone declares themselves Macedonian.\n\n  In  1913  Greece,   Serbia-Yugoslavia  and  Bulgaria  partioned\nMacedonia into three  pieces. In 1919 Albania  took 50 Macedonian\nvillages. The part under  Serbo-Yugoslav occupation broke away in\n1991  as the  independent Republic  of Macedonia.  There are  1.5\nmillion Macedonians in the Republic; 500,000 in Bulgaria; 150,000\nin Albania; and 300,000 in Serbia proper.\n\n  Sideropoulos  has been  a long  time campaigner  for Macedonian\nhuman rights in  Greece, and lost his job as  a forestry worker a\nfew years ago.  He was even exiled to an  obscure Greek island in\nthe mediteranean. Only pressure from Amnesty International forced\nthe Greek government  to allow him to return to  his home town of\nFlorina (Lerin) in Northern  Greece (Aegean Macedonia), where the\nmajority of ethnic Macedonians live.\n\n  Balkan watchers see the Sideropoulos  affair as a show trial in\nwhich  Greece is  desperate to  clamp down  on internal  dissent,\nespecially  when it  comes to  the issue  of recognition  for its\nnorthern neighbour, the Republic of Macedonia.\n\n  Last year the  State Department of the  United States condemned\nGreece for its bad treatment of ethnic Macedonians and Turks (who\nlargely live in Western Thrace).

Not this time, Enis. Furthermore, a new generation has risen - equipped \nwith a deep sense of commitment, politically mature and conscious, who \ndeterminedly pursue the Turkish Cause, through all necessary means, \nranging from the political and diplomatic to the armed struggle. In \nother words, what we have is a demand from the fascist government of\nx-Soviet Armenia to redress the wrongs that were done against our\npeople. \n\n\n "The crime of systematic cleansing by mass killing and extermination \n  of the Muslim population in the Soviet Republic of Armenia, Karabag, \n  Bosnia and Herzegovina is an 'Islamic Holocaust' comparable to the \n  extermination of 2.5 million Muslims by the Armenian Government \n  during the WWI and of over 6 million European Jews during the WWII."\n                  (Tovfik Kasimov - Azeri Leader - September 25, 1992)\n                 \n\n "Today's ethnic cleansing policies by the Serbian dictatorship against\n  Croatians and Muslims of Yugoslavia, as well as the Soviet Republic\n  of Armenia's against the Muslim population of neighboring Azerbaijan,\n  are really no different in their aspirations than the genocide \n  perpetrated by the Armenian Government 78 years ago against the\n  Turkish and Kurdish Muslims and Sephardic Jews living in these\n  lands."

Osinski):\nyears.\ncity\n\nAre you one of those people who were born when Istanbul was called \nKonstantinopolis? I don't think so! If those people use it because\nthey are used to do so, then I understand. But open any map\ntoday (except a few that try to be political) you will see that the name \nof the city is printed as Istanbul. So, don't try to give\nany arguments to using Konstantinopolis except to cause some\nflames, to make some political statement. \n\n\n--\nTankut Atan\ntankut@iastate.edu
I flipped on my local Cable Access Channel (a channel where any\ncommunity member can broadcast whatever they want for about $50\nper half hour) and saw a "documentary" (I use this term loosely)\non the conflict in the West Bank.\n\nIt was apparently made with a hand held camcorder (the quality was\nterrible, and the camera was really jumpy).  The documentary (sic)\ntold the tales of all of the children who died in the "war" against\nthe Jews as martyrs.  \n\nIt was a regular sob story.  One "victimized youth" was recounting\non how all he "really" wants to do is to get an education and that\nthe big bad Jews won't let him go to high school.  He admittedly \nspent 4 years in prison (age 13 to 17) for murdering a Jewish woman\nbut claims that it was "for the cause."\n\nI have seen this kind of garbage before.  I have a lot of sympathy for\nthe Palestinian cause (as do many Jews), but I think that even many\nArabs would be ashamed to call this a documentary!\n\nThe most suprising part is that the only credits shown at the end\nwas an address for the makers of the film named JEWISH COMM. ON\nTHE MIDDLE EAST.\n\nAnybody heard of them?  They make Peace Now look like right-wingers.
No, he does not.  Arafat explicitly *denies* this claim.\n\n\nfrom a Libyan televison interview with Yasser Arafat 7-19-1991\nQ: Some people say that the Palestinian revolution has many times changed\n   its strategies and tactics, something which has left its imprint on the\n   Palestinian problem and on the Palestinian Liberation Front.  The\n   [strategies and tactics] have not been clear.  The question is, is the\n   direction of the Palestinian problem clear?  The Palestinian leadership\n   has stopped, or at least this is what has been said in the media, this\n   happened on the way to the dialogue with the United States, the PLO\n   recognized something called "Israel"...\n\nA: No, no, no!  We do not recognize the State of Israel.  We said\n   "recognition" -- when a Palestinian state is established.  It will then\n   decide if to recognize Israel or not.  When it is established, its\n   parliament will convene and decide.\n\n\n	And replace them with what?  If Israel is to withdraw its\ncontrol of any territory, there must be two prerequsites.  One is that\nit leads to a reduction in deaths.  The second is that it should not\nweaken Israels bargianing position with respect to peace talks.\n\n	Leaving Gaza unilateraly is a bad idea because it encourages\narabs to think they can get what they want by killing Jews.  The only\nway Israel should pull out of Gaza is at the end of negotiations.\nThese negotiations should lead to a mutually agreeable solution with\nsecurity guarantees for both sides.\n\n	Until arabs are ready to sit down at the table and talk again,\nthey should not expect, or recieve more concessions.\n\n\nAdam\n\n\n\n\nAdam Shostack 				       adam@das.harvard.edu
Syria had been bombing Israeli settlements from the Golan and sending\nterrorist squads into Israel for years.  Do you need me to provide specifics?\nI can.\n\nWhy don't you give it up, Hasan?  I'm really starting to get tired of your \nempty lies.  You can defend your position and ideology with documented facts\nand arguments rather than the crap you regularly post.  Take an example from\nsomeone like Brendan McKay, with whom I don't agree, but who uses logic and\ndocumentation to argue his position.  Why must you insist on constantly spouting\nbaseless lies?  You may piss some people off, but that's about it.  You won't\nprove anything or add anything worthy to a discussion.  Your arguments just \nprove what a poor debater you are and how weak your case really is.
If a 'dog's prayers were answered, bones would rain from the sky.\nDid you know that the word 'Karabag' itself is a 'Turkish' name? \nBefore 1827, before the Russians and their 'zavalli kole' Armenians, \ndrove all the Turks/Muslims out, it was a Turkish majority town. Well,\nanyway, it is not surprising that Armenians also collaborated with the \nNazis.\n\n "Wholly opportunistic the Dashnaktzoutun have been variously\n  pro-Nazi, pro-Russia, pro-Soviet Armenia, pro-Arab, pro-Jewish,\n  as well as anti-Jewish, anti-Zionist, anti-Communist, and \n  anti-Soviet - whichever was expedient."[1]\n\n[1] John Roy Carlson (Arthur Derounian), 'Cairo to Damascus,' \n    Alfred A. Knopf, New York, 1951, p. 438.\n  \nAs a dear friend put it, the Tzeghagrons (Armenian Racial Patriots) \nwas the youth organization of the Dashnaktzoutun. It was based in\nBoston (where ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism Triangle is located) but \nhad followers in Armenian colonies all over the world. Literally\nTzeghagron means 'to make a religion of one's race.' The architect\nof the Armenian Racial Patriots was Garegin Nezhdeh, a Nazi Armenian\nwho became a key leader of collaboration with Hitler in World War II.\nIn 1933, he had been invited to the United States by the Central\nCommittee of the Dashnaktzoutun to inspire and organize the \nAmerican-Armenian youth. Nezhdeh succeeded in unifying many local\nArmenian youth groups in the Tzeghagrons. Starting with 20\nchapters in the initial year, the Tzeghagrons grew to 60 chapters\nand became the largest and most powerful Nazi Armenian organization.\nNezhdeh also provided the Tzeghagrons with a philosophy:\n\n "The Racial Religious beliefs in his racial blood as a deity.\n  Race above everything and before everything. Race comes first."[1]\n\n[1] Quoted in John Roy Carlson (real name Arthur Derounian), "The\n    Armenian Displaced Persons," in 'Armenian Affairs,' Winter,\n    1949-50, p. 19, footnote.\n\n\nNow wait, there is more.\n\nTHE GRUESOME extent of February's killings of Azeris by Armenians\nin the town  of Hojali is at last emerging  in Azerbaijan - about\n600 men,  women and  children dead  in the  worst outrage  of the\nfour-year war over Nagorny Karabakh.\n\nThe figure  is drawn  from Azeri investigators,  Hojali officials\nand casualty lists published in the Baku press. Diplomats and aid\nworkers say the death toll is in line with their own estimates.\n\nThe 25  February attack on Hojali  by Armenian forces was  one of\nthe last moves  in their four-year campaign to  take full control\nof Nagorny Karabakh,  the subject of a new  round of negotiations\nin Rome on Monday. The bloodshed was something between a fighting\nretreat and  a massacre, but  investigators say that most  of the\ndead were civilians. The awful  number of people killed was first\nsuppressed by  the fearful  former Communist government  in Baku.\nLater  it  was blurred  by  Armenian  denials and  grief-stricken\nAzerbaijan's wild  and contradictory  allegations of up  to 2,000\ndead.\n\nThe State Prosecuter, Aydin Rasulov,  the cheif investigator of a\n15-man  team  looking  into  what Azerbaijan  calls  the  "Hojali\nDisaster", said  his figure of 600  people dead was a  minimum on\npreliminary  findings.  A similar  estimate  was  given by  Elman\nMemmedov, the mayor of Hojali. An  even higher one was printed in\nthe Baku newspaper  Ordu in May - 479 dead  people named and more\nthan 200 bodies reported unidentified.  This figure of nearly 700\ndead is quoted as official by Leila Yunusova, the new spokeswoman\nof the Azeri Ministry of Defence.\n\nFranCois Zen  Ruffinen, head  of delegation of  the International\nRed Cross  in Baku, said  the Muslim imam  of the nearby  city of\nAgdam had reported a figure of  580 bodies received at his mosque\nfrom  Hojali, most  of  them  civilians. "We  did  not count  the\nbodies. But  the figure seems  reasonable. It is no  fantasy," Mr\nZen Ruffinen said. "We have some idea since we gave the body bags\nand products to wash the dead."\n\nMr  Rasulov endeavours  to give  an unemotional  estimate of  the\nnumber of  dead in the  massacre. "Don't  get worked up.  It will\ntake  several months  to  get a  final  figure," the  43-year-old\nlawyer said at his small office.\n\nMr Rasulov  knows about these  things. It  took him two  years to\nreach  a firm  conclusion that  131  people were  killed and  714\nwounded  when  Soviet  troops  and tanks  crushed  a  nationalist\nuprising in Baku in January 1990.\n\nThose  nationalists, the  Popular  Front, finally  came to  power\nthree weeks  ago and  are applying pressure  to find  out exactly\nwhat  happened when  Hojali, an  Azeri town  which lies  about 70\nmiles from the border with Armenia, fell to the Armenians.\n\nOfficially, 184 people have so  far been certified as dead, being\nthe  number of  people that  could be  medically examined  by the\nrepublic's forensic department. "This  is just a small percentage\nof the dead," said Rafiq Youssifov, the republic's chief forensic\nscientist. "They were the only bodies brought to us. Remember the\nchaos and the fact that we are  Muslims and have to wash and bury\nour dead within 24 hours."\n\nOf these 184 people, 51 were women, and 13 were children under 14\nyears old.  Gunshots killed  151 people,  shrapnel killed  20 and\naxes or  blunt instruments  killed 10.  Exposure in  the highland\nsnows killed the last three.  Thirty-three people showed signs of\ndeliberate mutilation, including ears,  noses, breasts or penises\ncut off and  eyes gouged out, according  to Professor Youssifov's\nreport. Those 184 bodies examined were less than a third of those\nbelieved to have been killed, Mr Rasulov said.\n\nFiles  from  Mr  Rasulov's  investigative  commission  are  still\ndisorganised -  lists of 44  Azeri militiamen are dead  here, six\npolicemen there,  and in handwriting  of a mosque  attendant, the\nnames of  111 corpses brought to  be washed in just  one day. The\nmost heartbreaking account from  850 witnesses interviewed so far\ncomes  from Towfiq  Manafov,  an Azeri  investigator  who took  a\nhelicopter  flight  over  the  escape route  from  Hojali  on  27\nFebruary.\n\n"There were too many bodies of  dead and wounded on the ground to\ncount properly: 470-500  in Hojali, 650-700 people  by the stream\nand the road and 85-100  visible around Nakhchivanik village," Mr\nManafov  wrote in  a  statement countersigned  by the  helicopter\npilot.\n\n"People waved up  to us for help. We saw  three dead children and\none  two-year-old alive  by  one  dead woman.  The  live one  was\npulling at her arm for the mother to get up. We tried to land but\nArmenians started a barrage against  our helicopter and we had to\nreturn."\n\nThere  has been  no consolidation  of  the lists  and figures  in\ncirculation because  of the political  upheavals of the  last few\nmonths and the  fact that nobody knows exactly who  was in Hojali\nat the time - many inhabitants were displaced from other villages\ntaken over by Armenian forces.\n\nTHE INDEPENDENT, London, 12/6/'92\n\nSerdar Argic
All your article reflects is your abundant ignorance. The people of \nTurkiye know quite well that Greece and the Greek Cypriots will never \nabandon the idea of hellenizing Cyprus and will remain eternally \nhopeful of uniting it with Greece, someday, whatever the cost to the\nparties involved. The history speaks for itself. Greece was the sole \nperpetrator of invasion on that island when it sent its troops on July \n15, 1974 in an attempt to topple the legitimate government of Archibishop \nMakarios.\n\nFollowing the Greek Cypriot attempt to annex the island to Greece with \nthe aid of the Greek army, Turkiye intervened by using her legal right \ngiven by two international agreements. Turkiye did it for the frequently \nand conveniently forgotten people of the island, Turkish Cypriots. For \nthose Turkish Cypriots whose grandparents have been living on the island \nsince 1571. \n\nThe release of Nikos Sampson, a member of EOKA [National Organization\nof Cypriot Fighters] and a convicted terrorist, shows that the\n'enosis' mentality continues to survive in Greece. One should not\nforget that Sampson dedicated his life to annihilating the Turks\nin Cyprus, committed murder to achieve this goal, and tried to\ndestroy the island's independence by annexing it to Greece. Of\ncourse, the Greek governments will have to bear the consequences \nfor this irresponsible conduct.\n\n\n            THE MUSEUM OF BARBARISM\n\n2 Irfan Bey Street, Kumsal Area, Nicosia, Cyprus\n\nIt is the  house of Dr. Nihat  Ilhan, a major who  was serving at\nthe Cyprus  Turkish Army Contingent. During  the attacks launched\nagainst the Turks by the Greeks, on 20th December 1963, Dr. Nihat\nIlhan's  wife and  three  children were  ruthlessly and  brutally\nkilled in the  bathroom, where they had tried to  hide, by savage\nGreeks. Dr.  Nihat Ilhan happened to  be on duty that  night, the\n24th   December  1963.   Pictures  reflecting   Greek  atrocities\ncommitted during and after 1963 are exhibited in this house which\nhas been converted into a museum.\n\nAN EYE-WITNESS ACCOUNT  OF HOW A TURKISH FAMILY  WAS BUTCHERED BY\nGREEK TERRORISTS\n\nThe date  is the 24th of  December, 1963... The onslaught  of the\nGreeks against the Turks, which  started three days ago, has been\ngoing on  with all its  ferocity; and defenseless women,  old men\nand children are being brutally  killed by Greeks. And now Kumsal\nArea of Nicosia witnesses the  worst example of the Greeks savage\nbloodshed...\n\nThe wife  and the  three infant  children of  Dr. Nihat  Ilhan, a\nmajor on duty at the camp  of the Cyprus Turkish Army Contingent,\nare  mercilessly and  dastardly  shot dead  while  hiding in  the\nbathroom of their house, by  maddened Greeks who broke into their\nhome. A glaring example of Greek barbarism.\n\nLet us  now listen to the  relating of the said  incident told by\nMr. Hasan  Yusuf Gudum, an  eye witness, who himself  was wounded\nduring the same terrible event.\n\n"On the night of the 24th  of December, 1963 my wife Feride Hasan\nand I were paying a visit to the family of Major Dr. Nihat Ilhan.\nOur neighbours  Mrs. Ayshe of  Mora, her daughter Ishin  and Mrs.\nAyshe's  sister Novber  were also  with us.  We were  all sitting\nhaving supper.  All of  a sudden bullets  from the  Pedieos River\ndirection started to riddle the  house, sounding like heavy rain.\nThinking  that   the  dining-room  where  we   were  sitting  was\ndangerous, we  ran to  the bathroom and  toilet which  we thought\nwould be  safer. Altogether we were  nine persons. We all  hid in\nthe bathroom  except my wife  who took  refuge in the  toilet. We\nwaited in fear. Mrs. Ilhan the wife of Major Doctor, was standing\nin the bath with her three children Murat, Kutsi and Hakan in her\narms. Suddenly with  a great noise we heard the  front door open.\nGreeks had  come in and were  combing, every corner of  the house\nwith  their machine  gun bullets.  During these  moments I  heard\nvoices saying, in  Greek, "You want Taksim eh!"  and then bullets\nstarted flying in the bathroom. Mrs. Ilhan and her three children\nfell into  the bath. They were  shot. At this moment  the Greeks,\nwho broke  into the bathroom, emptied  their guns on us  again. I\nheard one of the Major's children moan, then I fainted.\n\nWhen I came  to myself 2 or  3 hours later, I saw  Mrs. Ilhan and\nher three children lying dead in the  bath. I and the rest of the\nneighbours in the  bathroom were all seriously  wounded. But what\nhad happened to my wife? Then I remembered and immediately ran to\nthe  toilet, where,  in  the doorway,  I saw  her  body. She  was\nbrutally murdered.\n\nIn the  street admist the  sound of  shots I heard  voices crying\n"Help, help. Is  there no one to save us?"  I became terrified. I\nthought that  if the Greeks came  again and found that  I was not\ndead they would kill  me. So I ran to the  bedroom and hid myself\nunder the double-bed.\n\nAn our  passed by. In the  distance I could still  hear shots. My\nmouth was dry,  so I came out  from under the bed  and drank some\nwater. Then I put  some sweets in my pocket and  went back to the\nbathroom, which was exactly as I had left in an hour ago. There I\noffered sweets  to Mrs. Ayshe,  her daughter and Mrs.  Novber who\nwere all wounded.\n\nWe  waited in  the bathroom  until 5  o'clock in  the morning.  I\nthought morning would never come.  We were all wounded and needed\nto be taken  to hospital. Finally, as we could  walk, Mrs. Novber\nand I, went  out into the street hoping to  find help, and walked\nas far as Koshklu Chiftlik.\n\nThere, we met  some people who took us to  hospital where we were\noperated on. When  I regained my consciousness I  said that there\nwere more  wounded in the  house and  they went and  brought Mrs.\nAyshe and her daughter.\n\nAfter staying three  days in the hospital I was  sent by plane to\nAnkara  for  further treatment.  There  I  have had  four  months\ntreatment but still I cannot use  my arm. On my return to Cyprus,\nGreeks arrested me at the Airport.\n\nAll  I have  related to  you above  I told  the Greeks  during my\ndetention. They then released me."\n\nON FOOT INTO CYPRUS'S DEVASTATED TURKISH QUARTER\n\nWe went tonight into the sealed-off Turkish quarter of Nicosia in\nwhich 200  to 300 people have  been slaughtered in the  last five\ndays.\n\nWe  were the  first  Western  reporters there,  and  we saw  some\nterrible sights.\n\nIn the Kumsal quarter at No. 2, Irfan Bey Sokagi, we made our way\ninto  a house  whose floors  were  covered with  broken glass.  A\nchild's bicycle lay in a corner.\n\nIn the  bathroom, looking  like a group  of waxworks,  were three\nchildren piled on top of their murdered mother.\n\nIn a room next to it we glimpsed  the body of a woman shot in the\nhead.\n\nThis, we  were told, was the  home of a Turkish  Army major whose\nfamily had been killed by the mob in the first violence.\n\nToday was five days later, and still they lay there.\n\nRene MacCOLL and Daniel McGEACHIE, (From the "DAILY EXPRESS")\n\n"...I saw in  a bathroom the bodies of a  mother and three infant\nchildren murdered because their father was a Turkish Officer..."\n\nMax CLOS, LE FIGARO 25-26 January, 1964\n\n\n Peter Moorhead reporting from the village of Skyloura, Cyprus. \n Date : 1 January, 1964. \n\n IL GIARNO (Italy)\n \n THEY ARE TURK-HUNTING, THEY WANT TO EXTERMINATE THEM.\n\n Discussions start in London; in Cyprus terror continues.

I doubt if a napalm bomb\nattack could have created more devastation. I counted 40 blackened brick\nand concrete shells that had once been homes. Each house had been deliberately\nfired by petrol. Under red tile roofs which had caved in, I found a twisted\nmass of bed springs, children's conts and cribs, and ankle deep grey\nashes of what had once been chairs, tables and wardrobes.\n\nIn the neighbouring village of Ayios Vassilios, a mile away, I counted 16 \nwrecked and burned out homes.

There is something almost comical in the fact that Yigal Arens is \nimportant enough to have the ADL and G-d knows who else sifting through his \ngarbage (which happens to be legal; you throw it out, it ain't yours any more).\n\n	This brings to mind a few possibilities other than the ADL connection:\n\n	- it is all in Arens' mind.\n	- Bullock may have been working for Arens' friend in the PLO\n	- Arens' father (or is it brother?) Moshe Arens (former Israeli Defense \nMinister) was spying on him.\n	- Arens hired Bullock to spy on him to get attention.\n\n	In any case, who cares?
Ahhh, of course. Israeli morality pales in the face of charming events \nlike the string of PLO-run skyjackings in the mid 80's (remember those \nTWA jokes?), and not to forget the Achille Lauro and however many airline\nbombings they have committed, not to mention bombings on the streets of \nIsrael (It's gotten to a point where children are told not to go near any\nbags or containers whose origins they don't know, because they could be \nbombs), or last weeks Katyusha rocket attack on Northern Israel by Fatah,\nthose wonderful "mainstream moderates" with whom Israel is attempting\nto negotiate.\n\nLet's not forget the fact that more Palestinians are killed by Palestinians\nthan by Israelis.  Ahh yes, those charming humanitarian death squads.\nI've actually seen a videotape of an interrogation (DSee the documentary \n_Deadly Currents_--very neutral and balanced--seriously)--It was rather \ninquisition-esque. essentially, to prove his loyalty to "the cause" of\nwhichever group it was that was interogating him, he had to turn in someone\nelse, or else face death in one of the many fun-filled ways that the death-\nsquads love so much--beatings, dismemberment, acid, pouring melted plastic\non the face of the 'guilty party,' and of course beheading, always my \nfavorite.  Did you catch the photos in the Washington Post a while back \nthe execution of a "collaborator?"  3 photos:\n1) one Palestinian leading another at gunpoint.\n2) The "collaborator" on his knees, the gun pointed at his temple.\n3) The executioner standing on the corpse of the "collaborator\nshouting about how this is what happens to collaborators.\n\nWonderful justice system, and lots of regard for Human rights.\nRemember Black September?\nOk, so they just tried to take over Jordan, big deal.\n\nI'm rambling now, but are you getting what I'm saying?
And all this time I thought it was the US & Britian invading\nNormandy, the constant, round the clock bombing, and the fact that the\nGermans were fighting on two fronts.  How silly of me.  :)\n\n	This is not to devalue the actions of the resistance\nmovements, but resistance movements did not defeat the Nazis.\n\n\n	Israel has repeatedly stated that it will leave when the\nLebanese government shows that it can prevent attacks on Israel, and\nwhen the Syrians agree to leave.\n\n	The Lebanese have not tried diplomacy for very long, or maybe\nthey're not capable of getting rid of the Syrians and Iranians who\noccupy their land.  If they closed down the Hezbolah, and negotiated a\nwithdrawl of Syrian forces, Israel would be happy to leave.\n\nAdam\n\nAdam Shostack 				       adam@das.harvard.edu
I have read that there will be some concrete proposals concerning creation\nof a "palestinian police force" during the talk's next stage.  Does anyone\nknows of the details of this idea? How does it "fit" with the differing\nconceptions listed above?
The village I described was actually the closest I could come to\ndescribing mine.  I agree there may be other villages where the civilian\npopulation has deserted because it is too close to Israeli lines and\nthus gets bombed more often.  In such villages often the only remaining \ninhabitants are guerillas and some elderly who have nowhere else to go.\nBut for the most part the typical South Lebanon village is more like\nmine.  One where civilians and guerillas live together.  They are\noften inhabiting the same house.  Many families are large, some\nhave members of the families involved in Hizollah, most others\nare not.  That is what is so hard of South Lebanon, Israel is\nnot fighting an army with well drawn battle lines, but a guerilla\ntyoe resistance which by definition and necessity blends with\nthe local populace.  Not because they are evil cowards that\nuse women and children as shields, but because that is the only\nway one can fight a more powerful better equipped occupying army.\n\n\nHizbollah and Amal are now the main two militias.  Though\nHizbollah people tend to be more committed to resistrance\noperation and better motivated by religious conviction.\n\n  As to retaliation,\n\nIt may be a mixture of what we both say.  Sometimes Israel chooses\nits targets carefully.  At other times it just sends its pilots on\nsorties aimed at a town in general since it only knows that the \nattackers came from that specific village but has no further\nintelligence.  On several occasions Israel retalliated against \ncivilian refugee camps, even in North Lebanon, just to show\nthat it will not sit idly after its soldiers have been attacked.\nMost of the time it directs the SLA to do the dirty work and\nindiscriminately shell some Lebanese villages on the other side.\nI have experienced this shelling myself on several occasions,\nthis is why the SLA militia is sometimes even more despised than \nIsraeli troops.\n\n\nI hope you are right on Israeli willingness to withdraw, but I still\ncontend that withdrawal would be the better course for Israel's\nsecurity, since it would reduce its  military losses, and I claim\nthat the Lebanese and Syrian gov'ts would be able to prevent any \nfurther attacks on Northern Israel.\n \n\n\nHmm...  Here we disagree on what serves Syria interests better.\nI think Syria wants to have Lebanon all to itself.  It would\nbe willing to guarantee Northern Israel's security in return for\nIsraeli withdrawal.  I don't think Syria wants Israel to be\ninvolved in its protectorate of Lebanon.  Syria is sitting at the\nnegotiating table because it has come to accept that and wants\nto get a political resolution.  A renewal of hostilities\nalong the Lebanese front could put the whole ME peace negotiations\nback in question.\n\n\n\n\nI agree that the loss of any human life is deplorable and regrettable.
When the PLO moved into Lebanon and became, in parts of Lebanon, an\nOccupying Power itself, these same practices were common against\nnon-Palestinean and Palestinean alike.  They are simply Standard\nOperating Procedures among Palestineans and have been for a very long\ntime.  In fact, the greatest bloodbath of Palestineans will happen\nwhen they get self-rule.

This a "tried and true" method utilized by guerilla and terrorists groups:\nto conduct operations in the midst of the local populace, thus forcing the\nopposing "state" to possible harm innocent civilians in their search or,\nin order to avoid the deaths of civilians, abandon the search. Certainly the\npeople who use the population for cover are *also* to blaim for dragging the\ninnocent civilians into harm's way.\n\nAre you suggesting that, when guerillas use the population for cover, Israel\nshould totally back down? So...the easiest way to get away with attacking\nanother is to use an innocent as a shield and hope that the other respects\ninnocent lives?\n\n\nYour damn right Israel insists on some sort of "demilitarized" or "buffer"\nzone. Its had to put up with too many years of attacks from the territory\nof Arab states and watched as the states did nothing. It is not exactly\nsurprizing that Israel decided that the only way to stop such actions is to \ndo it themselves.\n\n\nWhat? So the whole bit about attacks on Israel from neighboring Arab states \ncan start all over again? While I also hope for this to happen, it will\nonly occur WHEN Arab states show that they are *prepared* to take on the \nresponsibility and the duty to stop guerilla attacks on Israel from their \nsoil. They have to Prove it (or provide some "guaratees"), there is no way\nIsrael is going to accept their "word"- not with their past attitude of \ntolerance towards "anti-Israel guerillas in-residence".\n\nGood lord, Brad. What in the world goves you the idea that UN troops stop\nanything? They are ONLY stationed in a country because that country allows\nthem in. It can ask them to leave *at any time*; as Nasser did in '56 and\n'67. Somehow, with that "limitation" on the troops "powers" I don't\nthink that Israel is going to be any more comfortable. Without a *genuine* commitment to peace from the Arab states, and concrete (not intellectual or political exercises in jargon) "guarantees" by other parties, the UN is worthless\nto Israel (but, perhaps useful as a "ruse"?).\n\n\nPerhaps you are aware that, to most communities of people, there is\nthe feeling that it is better that "many of us die fighting\nagainst those who attack us than for few to die while we silently \naccept our fate." If,however, you call on Israel to see the sense of \nsuffering fewer casualties, I suggest you apply the same to Palestinian,\nArab and Islamic groups.\n\n\nFrom Israel's perspective, "concessions" gets it NOTHING...except the \nrealization that it has given "something" up and now *can only \nhope* that the other side decides to do likewise. Words *can be taken\nback* by merely doing so; to "take back" tangible items (land,\ncontrol of land) requires the sort of action you say Israel should\nstay away from.\n \nIsrael put up with attacks from Arab state territories for decades \nbefore essentially putting a stop to it through its invasion of Lebanon.\nThe entire basis of that reality was exactly as you state above: 1) Israel \nwould express outrage at these attacks and protest to the Arab state \ninvolved, 2) that state promptly ignored the entire matter, secure \nin the knowledge that IT could not be held responsible for the acts \ncommitted by "private groups", 3) Israel would prepare for the next \nround of attacks. What would Israel want to return to those days (and\ndon't be so idiotic as to suggest "trust" for the motivations of\npresent-day Arab states)?\n\nAh, ok...what is "different" about the present situation that tells\nus that the Arab states will *not* pursue their past antagonistic \npolicies towards Israel? Now, don't talk about vague "political factors"\nbut about those "tangible" (just like that which Israel gave up)\nfactors that "guarantee" the responsibility of those states. Your\nassessment of "difference" here is based on a whole lot of assumptions,\nand most states don't feel confortable basing their existence on that\nsort of thing.\n\n\nIt has not. Without the support, and active involvement, of Syria,\nLebanon would not have been able to accomplish all that has occurred.\nOnce Syria leaves who is to say that Lebanon will be able to retain \ncontrol? If Syria stays thay may be even more dangerous for Israel.\nTim
It wasn't all that long ago that the acts of Israeli soldiers were\ndescribed as "superhuman".  Now, they are "inhuman".  Did the Israelis\nchange so radically so quickly or have reporting attitudes changed?\n\n\nWhen the Jews were powerless, they did what they could to help others,\nwhich was obviously quite limited.  Later, liberated American Jews\nwere on the forefront of the civil-rights movement.  The Jewish\ngovernment of Israel rescued Jews ranging in skin color from White\nRussian to Brown Yemenite to Black Ethiopian.  Please, Andi, tell us\n"how the Jews are treating other races when they got power."\n\n\nYour ignorance and bias are indeed unfortunate.

Yes, victims exist.  There are a staggering number of victims in the world and\nmore each day.  I think on balance, intervention would create more victims,\nincluding American ones.  Since the first responsibility of the US government\nis to protect Americans, I think they serve that role best by staying away\nfrom Bosnia and other regional conflicts.\n\n\nOf course not.  The Jews were not trying to carve a territory out of Germany\neither, and except for small-scale resistance and a few larger uprisings, did\nnot have an army or a government.\n\n\nI see the pattern of atrocities as a fairly often practiced tactic of a\ncolonizing power - driving away and/or eliminating the population of an\narea they want to control.  The US tried basically that in Vietnam, the Iraqis\nin Kuwait, the Israelis in Palestine, South Africa, etc, etc, etc.  It sucks,\nit's ugly, and it's saddening.  But it is not genocide.\n\nIt is not my impression that the Serbs want to eliminate every Muslim in\nYugoslavia.  I still say the Bosnians are getting their asses kicked; they\nshould surrender and evacuate the areas they can't hold.\n\n\nI am a staunch Republican, BTW.  The irony of arguing against military\nintervention with arguments based on Vietnam has not escaped me.  I was opposed\nto US intervention in Somalia for the same reasons, although clearly it was\nnot nearly as risky.\n\n\nWell, one thing you have to remember is, the press likes a good story.   Good\nfor business, don't you know.  And BTW, not "everyone" wants to help the\nside that is less like us.\n\nI never said the two sides were morally equivalent, I said neither one is\ninnocent.\n\nThere are just too many good reasons to stay away:\n\n1) The Europeans are perfectly able to deal with this dispute on their borders\n   in any way we do it.  Put another way, we have no assistance to offer the\n   Europeans which they do not already possess themselves.  It is not good to\n   promote the idea in anyone's mind that the United States is responsible\n   for cleaning up every bloody mess in the world.\n\n2) Clinton is not the man to lead this country into a military adventure.

I agree with Shai,  there are many references to Israeli\nplans on the Litani river but I have yet to find hard \nevidence.  I had mentioned before that there is a report\ncommissioned by the UN to study the Litani river, it is \nstill in draft form.  The Israeli gov't also commissioned\na study on the river that was done by Dr. Ben Wolfe.\nThe Litani starts in the Bekaa valley in Lebanon,\nflows Southward, then West across South Lebanon and\ndischarges into the Mediterranean near the city of Tyre.\nThere are other rivers such as the Hasbani and the Wazzani\nthat start in Lebanese territory than join the Jordan river.  \nThe most mentioned plan was one that would divert water\nfrom the Litani into these, then the water would flow\nnaturally into the Lac De Houle.  BUT there is no evidence\nof any diversion structure (which would need to be at least\n3 km long).  The area is mountainous, inaccessible and\noccupied by Israel so I have not seen any independent \nreports of the existence of any diversion structure there.\nAnother often mentioned diversion is through deep wells.\nIt is also rumored that Israe has 600 m wells\ntapping into deep aquifers and drawing water on the\nIsraeli side of the border.  If such wells are indeed\nunder use they would be costly to operate \n(high energy costs) and the Lebanese and Israeli gov't should \nagree on the distribution of water from shared aquifers\nas part of an overall peace plan and the bilateral\nnegociations on "regional issues".  The fact that we have\nbeen at war all this time has led to the current state\nof affairs where withdrawals from such aquifers is\ncompletely unregulated.\n\n\nBasil

Do you sit there and WATCH or DEFEND yoursef(fat chance)?\n	Do you remember what Azeris did to the Armenians in BAKU ? All the\n	BARBERIAN ACTS especially against MOTHERS and their CHILDREN.

They are \n        NOT asking much. They simply want to get back what was TAKEN AWAY \n	from them and GIVEN to AZERIS by STALIN. \n\nBM] Think of 10 or 20 years down the line -- both of the newly independent \nBM] countries need to develop economically and neither one is going to wipe \nBM] the other out.   These people will be neighbors, would it not be better \nBM] to keep the bad blood between them minimal?\n\n	Don't get me WRONG. I also want PEACEFUL solution to the\n	conflict. But until Azeris realize that, the Armenians in\n	KARABAKH will defend themselves against aggresion.\n\nBM] If you belong to the Armenian diaspora, keep in mind that what strikes\nBM] your fancy on the map is costing the local Armenians dearly in terms of \nBM] their blood and future. \n\n	Again, you are taking different TURNS. Armenia HAS no intension\n        to GRAB any LAND from Azerbaijan. The Armenians in KARABAKH\n        are simply defending themselves UNTIL a solution is SET.\n\nBM] It's easy to be comfortable abroad and propagandize \nBM] craziness to have your feelings about Turks tickled.  The Armenians\nBM] in Armenia and N-K will be there, with the same people you seem to hate \nBM] as their neighbors, for maybe 3000 years more.  The sooner there's peace in\nBM] the region the better it is for them and everyone else.  I'd push for\nBM] compromise if I were you instead of hitting the caps-lock and spreading\nBM] inflammatory half-truths.
From: Center for Policy Research <cpr>\nSubject: Symbiotics: Zionism-Antisemitism\n\n\nZionism and the Holocaust\n-------------------------- by Haim Bresheeth\n\nThe first point to note regarding the appropriation of the history\nof the Holocaust by Zionist propaganda is that Zionism without\nanti-semitism is impossible. Zionism agrees with the basic tenet\nof anti-Semitism, namely that Jews cannot live with non- Jews.\n\nThe history and roots of the Holocaust go back a long way. While\nthe industru of death and destruction did not operate before 1942,\nits roots were firmly placed in the 19th Century. Jewish\naspirations for emancipation emerged out of the national struggles\nin Europe. When the hopes for liberation through\nbourgeois-democratic change were dashed, other alternatives for\nimproving the lot of the Jews of Europe achieved prominence.\n\nThe socialist Bund, a mass movement with enormous following, had\nto contend with opposition from a new and small, almost\ninsignificant opponent, the political Zionists.  In outline these\ntwo offered diametrically opposed options for Jews in Europe.\nWhile the Bund was suggesting joining forces with the rest of\nEurope's workers, the Zionists were proposing a new programme\naimed at ridding Europe of its Jews by setting up some form of a\nJewish state.\n\nHistorically, nothing is inevitable, all depends on the balance of\nforces involved in the struggle. History can be seen as an option\ntree: every time a certain option is chosen, other routes become\nbarred. Because of that choice, movement backwards to the point\nbefore that choice was made is impossible. While Zionism as an\noption was taken by many young Jews, it remained a minority\nposition until the first days of the 3rd Reich. The Zionist\nFederation of Germany (ZVfD), an organisation representing a tiny\nminority of German Jews, was selected by the Nazis as the body to\nrepresent the Jews of the Reich. Its was the only flag of an\ninterantional organisation allowed to fly in Berlin, and this was\nthe only international organisation allowed to operate during this\nperiod. From a marginal position, the leaders of the Zionist\nFederation were propelled to a prominence and centrality that\nsurprised even them. All of a sudden they attained political\npower, power based not on representation, but from being selected\nas the choice of the Nazi regime for dealing with the the 'Jewish\nproblem'. Their position in negotiating with the Nazis agreements\nthat affected the lives of many tens of thousands of the Jews in\nGermany transformed them from a utopian, marginal organisation in\nGermany (and some other countries in Europe) into a real option to\nbe considered by German Jews.\n\nThe best example of this was the 'Transfer Agreement' of 1934.\nImmediately after the Nazi takeover in 1933, Jews all over the\nworld supported or were organising a world wide boycott of German\ngoods. This campaign hurt the Nazi regime and the German\nauthorities searched frantically for a way disabling the boycott.\nIt was clear that if Jews and Jewish organisations were to pull\nout, the campaign would collapse.\n\nThis problem was solved by the ZVfD. A letter sent to the Nazi\nparty as early as 21.  June 1933, outlined the degree of agreement\nthat existed between the two organisations on the question of\nrace, nation, and the nature of the 'Jewish problem', and it\noffered to collaborate with the new regime:\n\n"The realisation of Zionism could only be hurt by resentment of\nJews abroad against the German development. Boycott propaganda -\nsuch as is currently being carried out against Germany in many\nways - is in essence unZionist, because Zionism wants not to do\nbattle but to convince and build."\n\nIn their eagerness to gain credence and the backing of the new\nregime, the Zionist organisation managed to undermine the boycott.\nThe main public act was the signature of the "Transfer Agreement"\nwith the Nazi authorities during the Zionist Congress of 1934. In\nessence, the agreement was designed to get Germany's Jews out of\nthe country and into Mandate Palestine. It provided a possibility\nfor Jews to take a sizeable part of their property out of the\ncountry, through a transfer of German goods to Palestine. This\nright was denied to Jews leaving to any other destination. The\nZionist organisation was the acting agent, through its financial\norganisations. This agreement operated on a number of fronts -\n'helping' Jews to leave the country, breaking the ring of the\nboycott, exporting German goods in large quantities to Palestine,\nand last but not least, enabling the regime to be seen as humane\nand reasonable even towards its avowed enemies, the Jews. After\nall, they argued, the Jews do not belong in Europe and now the\nJews come and agree with them.\n\nAfter news of the agreement broke, the boycott was doomed. If the\nZionist Organization found it possible and necessary to deal with\nthe Nazis, and import their goods, who could argue for a boycott ?\nThis was not the first time that the interests of both movements\nwere presented to the German public as complementary. Baron Von\nMildenstein, the first head of the Jewish Department of the SS,\nlater followed by Eichmann, was invited to travel to Palestine.\nThis he did in early 1933, in the company of a Zionist leader,\nKurt Tuchler. Having spent six months in Palestine, he wrote a\nseries of favourable articles in Der STURMER describing the 'new\nJew' of Zionism, a Jew Nazis could accept and understand.\n\nThis little-known episode established quite clearly the\nrelationship during the early days of Nazism, between the new\nregime and the ZVfD, a relationship that was echoed later in a\nnumber of key instances, even after the nature of the Final\nSolution became clear. In many cases this meant a silencing of\nreports about the horrors of the exterminations. A book\nconcentrating on this aspect of the Zionist reaction to the\nHolocaust is Post-Ugandan Zionism in the Crucible of the\nHolocaust, by S. B. Beth-Zvi.\n\nIn the case of the Kastner episode, around which Jim Allen's play\nPERDITION is based, even the normal excuse of lack of knowledge of\nthe real nature of events does not exist. It occured near the end\nof the war. The USSR had advanced almost up to Germany. Italy and\nthe African bases had been lost. The Nazis were on the run, with a\nnumber of key countries, such as Rumania, leaving the Axis. A\nsecond front was a matter of months away, as the western Allies\nprepared their forces. In the midst of all this we find Eichmann,\nthe master bureaucrat of industrial murder, setting up his HZ in\noccupied Budapest, after the German takeover of the country in\nApril 1944. His first act was to have a conference with the Jewish\nleadership, and to appoint Zionist Federation members, headed by\nKastner as the agent and clearing house for all Jews and their\nrelationship with the SS and the Nazr authorities. Why they did\nthis is not difficult to see. As opposed to Poland, where its\nthree and  a half million Jews lived in ghettoes and were visibly\ndifferent from the rest of the Polish population, the Hungarian\nJews were an integrated part of the community. The middle class\nwas mainly Jewish, the Jews were mainly middle-class. They enjoyed\nfreedom of travel, served in the Hungarian (fascist) army in\nfronline units, as officers and soldiers, their names were\nHungarian - how was Eichmann to find them if they were to be\nexterminated ? The task was not easy, there were a million Jews in\nHungary, most of them resident, the rest being refugees from other\ncountries. Many had  heard about the fate of Jews elsewhere, and\nwere unlikely to believe any statements by Nazi officials.\n\nLike elsewhere, the only people who had the information and the\near of the frightened Jewish population were the Judenrat. In this\ncase the Judenrat comprsied mainly the Zionist Federation members.\nWithout their help the SS, with 19 officers and less than 90 men,\nplus a few hundred Hungarian police, could not have collected and\ncontrolled a million Jews, when they did not even know their\nwhereabouts. Kastner and the others were left under no illusions.\nEichmann told Joel Brand, one of the members of Kastner's\ncommittee, that he intended to send all Hungary's Jews to\nAuschwitz, before he even started the expulsions!  He told them\nclearly that all these Jews will die, 12,000 a day, unless certain\nconditions were met.\n\nThe Committee faced a simple choice - to tell the Jews of Hungary\nabout their fate, (with neutral Rumania, where many could escape,\nbeing in most cases a few hours away) or to collaborate with the\nNazis by assisting in the concentration process. What would not\nhave been believed when coming from the SS, sounded quite\nplausible when coming from the mouths of the Zionist leadership.\nThus it is, that most of the Hungarian Jews went quietly to their\ndeath, assured by their leadership that they were to be sent to\nwork camps.\n\nTo be sure, there are thirty pieces of silver in this narrative of\ndestruction: the trains of 'prominents' which Eichmann promised to\nKastner - a promise he kept to the last detail. For Eichmann it\nwas a bargain: allowing 1,680 Jews to survive, as the price paid\nfor the silent collaboration over the death of almost a million\nJews.\n\nThere was no way in which the Jews of Hungary could even be\nlocated, not to say murdered, without the full collaboration of\nKastner and his few friends. No doubt the SS would hunt a few Jews\nhere and there, but the scale of the operation would have been\nminiscule compared to the half million who died in Auschwitz.\n\nIt is important to realise that Kastner was not an aberration,\nlike say Rumkovsky in Lodz. Kastner acted as a result of his\nstrongly held Zionist convictions. His actions were a logical\noutcome of earlier positions. This is instanced when he exposed to\nthe Gestapo the existence of a British cell of saboteurs, Palgi\nand Senesh, and persuaded them to give themselves up, so as not to\ndisrupt his operations. At no point during his trial or elsewhere,\ndid Kastner deny that he knew exactly what was to happen to those\nJews.
Of course posting some hard evidence or facts is much more\ndifficult.  You have not bothered to substantiate this in\nany way.  Basil, do you know of any evidence that would support\nthis?\n\nI can just imagine a news report from ancient times, if Hasan\nhad been writing it.\n\nNewsflash:\nCairo AP (Ancient Press).  Israel today denied Egypt acces to the Red\nSea.  In a typical display of Israelite agressiveness, the leader of\nthe Israelite slave revolt, former prince Moses, parted the Red Sea.\nThe action is estimated to have caused irreparable damage to the environment.\nEgyptian authorities have said that thousands of fisherman have been\ndenied their livelihood by the parted waters.  Pharaoh's brave charioteers\nwere successful in their glorious attempt to cause the waters of the\nRed Sea to return to their normal state.  Unfortunately they suffered\nheavy casualties while doing so.
No. I do not thing we are doing them a favor.  I have simply stated that\n they are not treated as a second class citizens. That was my point.\n I fail to see how my words show discrimination. And what do you mean that\n they do not get nothing? Is, for example, helth insurance, food, and tuition\n nothing?\n\n\n I'm sorry, but I cannot see any logical order in the above argument.\n\n\n What part exactly is this one? The people cannot even sell their property\n if they want to leave Turkey.  The patriarch could not get a permision to\n renovate some buildings for decades; it needed a special agreement between\n the two goverments for this. Talk about a part of the society?

From: _Quantum_ Magazine, March/April 1993 pages 42-46\n\n	The Problem Book of Anania of Shirak\n	------------------------------------\n\n		"On the ancient peak of Ararat\n		The centuries have come like seconds\n		And passed on."\n				-Avetik Issahakian\n\nby Yuri Danilov\n\nSome years ago Journalists interviewing celebrities liked to ask them: "What\nbooks would you take with you if you were to go off on a space flight?" And \nthough the number of books allowed on the trip varied from 10 to 30, \ndepending on the type of spacecraft and the generosity of the interviewer, \nand celebrities are people of the most varied tastes, ages, and professions, \nnot one of them dared to say that he or she would want to take with them at\nleast one book of arithmetic problems.\n\nSome of these people certainly excluded this kind of literature because they \nwere trained in the humanities and had nothing but scorn for "numbers" (though \nsecretly afraid of them). Others steered clear of such puzzle books because \nthey were masters of incomparably more difficult branches of modern \nmathematics and didn't mind saying for all the world to hear that they didn't \nknow how to solve mere arithmetic problems. Professional mathematicians were \nno exception. Here's what the Russian mathematician Alexander Khinchin, a \nspecialist in statistics, wrote about arithmetic: "I willingly confess that \nany time a fifth-grader asked me to help solve an arithmetic problem, it was\na hard work for me, and sometimes I failed completely. Of course, like most of \nmy friends, I could easily solve the problem by the natural algebraic route\n--constructing equations or sets of equations. But we were supposed to avoid \nusing algebraic analysis at all costs! . . . By the way, it's a fact that is \nwell known and oft repeated that, as a rule, neither high school graduates, \nnor students at teaching colleges, nor teachers beginning their careers\n(nor, I must add, scientific researchers) can solve arithmetic problems. It \nseems the only people in the world who are able to solve them are fifth-grade \nteachers."\n\nNow, I'm not insisting that a book of arithmetic problems be included in the \nbookbag of anyone flying into space. But a sense of justice induces me to \nrecommend one particular problem book, one that will satisfy the most \nfastidious taste and supply food for thought sufficient not only for a \nrelatively short flight to the Moon but for a extended space voyage--say, to\nVenus and back.\n\n			One for the "road"\n\n	They both took out the books they brought for the road. Kingsley \n	glanced at the Royal Astronomer's book and saw a bright cover with \n	a group of cutthroats shooting at each other with revolvers. "God \n	knows what this kind of stuff leads to," thought Kingsley.\n\n	The Royal Astronomer looked at Kingsley's book and saw the History \n	of Herodotus. "Good Lord, next he'll be reading Thucydides," thought \n	the Royal Astronomer.\n					--Fred Hoyle, The Black Cloud\n\nThe book I'm talking about isn't very big, but its 24 problems constitute 24 \nelegant miniatures from seventh-century Armenia. Naive and wise at the same\ntime, rich in striking detail and the bright coloration of the period, these \nproblems are reminiscent of the reliefs on the famous monument of Armenian \narchitecture, the church on the island of Akhtamar in Lake Van (in what is \nnow Turkey_. They are as inseparable from the image of Armenia as the elegant \nletters of the Armenian alphabet, invented by Mesrop Mashtots, or the songs of \nKomitas, or the paintings of Saryan.\n\nAn edition of these incredibly beautiful problems has long been a \nbibliographic rarity. It was published under the title Problems and Solutions\nof Vardapet [1] Anania of Shirak, Armenian Mathematician of the Seventh \nCentury (translated and published by I. A. Orbeli, Petrograd, 1918).\n\nThe abundance of close observations and wide-ranging information about the way \nof life and customs of that remote epoch when Anania of Shirak lived and \nworked have actually rendered a disservice to his problem book. For many years \nthe book was known only to researchers in the humanities--specialists in \nArmenian history who jealously guarded their treasure and wouldn't let just\nanyone see it. Even now, after research by K. P. Patkanov, the learned monk \nFather Kaloust, J.I. Orbeli, A. Abramyan, V. K. Chaloyan, and others has \nbrought the works of Anania of Shirak to light in scholarly circles, the \ngeneral reader remains ignorant of the very existence of this remarkable \nproblem book.\n\n		Vardapet Anania of Shirak\n\n	Once fell in love with the art of calculation, I thought that no \n	philosophical notion can be constructed without number, considering \n	it the mother of all wisdom.\n					--Anania of Shirak\n\nAmong ancient Armenian thinkers, Vardapet Anania of Shirak stands out because \nof the breadth of his interests and the unique mathematical orientation of his \nwork. Some of his works have been preserved. In addition to the Problems and\nSolutions, the following tracts have found a special place in the estimation\nof scholars: On Weights and Measures, Cosmography and Calendrical Theory, and\nArmenian Geography of the Seventh Century A.D. (the authorship of the last\nwork was long attributed to another outstanding thinker of ancient Armenia, \nMovses of Khoren).\n\nIn his autobiography, Anania of Shirak has this to say about himself:\n\n	I, Anania of Shirak, having studied all the science of our\n	Armenian land and having learned the Holy Scripture intimately, \n	in the expression of the psalmist, "every day I illuminated the \n	eyes of my mind." Feeling myself lacking in the art of calculation,\n	I came to the conclusion that it is fruitless to study philosophy, \n	the mother of all sciences, without number. I could find in Armenia \n	neither a man versed in philosophy nor books that explained the \n	sciences. I therefore went to Greece and met in Theodosiople a man \n	named Iliazar who was well versed in ecclesiastical works. He told me\n	that in Forth Armenia [2] there lived a famous mathematician,\n	Christosatur. I went this person and spent six months with him. But \n        soon I noticed that Christosatur was a master not of all science but \n        only of certain fragmentary facts.\n\n	I then went to Constantinople, where I met acquaintances who told me: \n	"Why did you go so far, when much closer to us, in Trebizon, on the \n	coast of Pontus [3] lives the Byzantine vardapet Tyukhik. He is full \n	of wisdom, is known to kings, and knows Armenian literature." I asked \n	them how they knew this. They answered: "We saw ourselves that many \n	people traveled long distances to become pupils of so learned a man. \n	Indeed the archdeacon of the patriarchate of Constantinople,\n	Philagrus, traveled with us, bringing many young persons to become \n	pupils of Tyukhik." When I heard this, I expressed my gratitude to \n	God, who had quenched the thirst of His slave.\n\n	I went to Tyukhik at the monastery of St. Eugene and explained why I \n	He sent you to learn and to transplant science in the domain of St. \n	Gregory; I am glad that all your country will learn from me. I myself \n	lived in Armenia for many years as a youth. Ignorance reigned there." \n	Vardapet Tyukhik loved me as a son and shared all his thoughts with \n	me. The Lord bestowed upon me His blessing: I completely assimilated \n	the science of number, and with such success that my fellow students\n	at the king's court began to envy me.\n\n	I spent eight years with Tyukhik and studied many books that had not \n	been translated into our language. For the vardapet had an innumerable \n	collection of books: secret and explicit, ecclesiastical and pagan, \n	books on art, history, and medicine, books of chronologies. Why \n	enumerate them by title? In a word, there is no book that Tyukhik did \n	not have. And he had such a gift from the Holy Spirit for translating\n	that when he sat down to translate something from the Greek into \n	Armenian, he did not struggle as other translators did, and the \n	translation read as if the work were written in that language \n	originally.\n\n	Tyukhik told me how he had achieved such vast erudition and how he had \n	learned the Armenian language. "When I was young," he said, "I lived \n	in Trebizon, at the court of the military chief Ioannus Patricus, and \n	for a long time, up to the accession of Mauritius to the throne I \n	served as a military man in Armenia and learned your language and \n	literature. During one attack by Persian troops on the Greeks, I was \n	wounded and escaped to Antioch. I lost all my possessions. Praying to \n	the Lord to heal my wounds, I made a promise: "If You prolong my life, \n	I shall dedicate it not to accumulating perishable treasures but to \n	collecting treasures of knowledge." And the Lord heard my prayers. \n	After I recovered I went to Jerusalem, and from there to Alexandria \n	and Rome. Upon returning to Constantinople, I met a famous philosopher \n	from Athens and studied with him for many years. After that I returned \n	to my homeland and began to teach and instruct my people."\n\n	After some years that philosopher died. Not finding a replacement for \n	him, the king and his courtiers sent for Tyukhik and invited him to \n	assume the teacher's position. Tyukhik, citing the promise he made to \n	God not to move far from the city, turned down the offer. But because\n	of his wide leaning, people came streaming from all countries to study \n	with him.\n\n	And I, the most insignificant of all Armenians, having learned from \n	him this powerful science, desired by kings, brought it to our \n	country, supported by no one, obligated only to my own industry, God's \n	help, and the prayers of the Blessed Educator. And no one thanked me \n	for my efforts.\n\n				Problems and Solutions\n\n	A half and one sixth and one nine-ninth of all the books were printed\n	on verge'; one fifth and one two-hundred-eighty-fifth--on rag paper; \n	one forty-fifth and one eight-hundred-fifty-fifth--on vellum, and \n	forty-five inscribed copies--on Dutch paper. And so, find how many \n	copies were printed in all.\n					--Imitation of Anania of Shirak\n\nA Latin proverb says habent sua fata libelli ("books have their own fate").\nThe fate of Problems and Solutions by Anania of Shirak is quite amazing. The\nmanuscripts of Anania's book were preserved only because, according to \nArmenian historians, "in ancient and medieval Armenia manuscripts were guarded \nfrom invaders, like weapons, and cherished, like one's own children." Biding\ntheir time, the manuscripts lay in the Matenadaran, a renowned depository of \nancient manuscripts (now the Mesrop Mashtots Institute of Ancient Manuscripts).\nAnd its hour finally arrived. In 1896 the learned monk Father Kaloust used two \nmanuscripts to publish the problem book, supplementing it with an introduction \nand commentary. In 1918 the book was translated into Russian, edited, \nannotated, and typeset by Iosef Orbeli, a prominent scholar (and later a \nmember of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR).\n\nIn the translator's words, the problems of Anania are "amusing, full of life, \nand simple." Orbeli goes on to say: "The subjects of the problems are \ngenerally taken from everyday life. The scene is predominantly his homeland \nShirak and the surrounding countryside, and the dramatis personae, if they are \nnamed, are the local princes--the Kamsarakans, including Nersekh, who was a \ncontemporary of Anania." Like other ancient authors, Anania of Shirak used \nonly "aliquots" -- that is, fractions with a numerator of 1. When it is\nnecessary to write fractions with numerators other than 1, one has to \nrepresent it as a sum of aliquots (see the epigraph above).\n\nLike any true work of art, the problems of Anania suffer terribly in the \nretelling. You have to read the originals (albeit in translation) in their \nfull glory. So let's open Anania's problem book--a gift from across the ages.\n\nProblems 1 and 8 relate to the Armenian uprising against the Persians in A.D. \n572.\n\nProblem 1\n\nMy father told me the following story. During the famous wars between the \nArmenians and the Persians, prince Zaurak Kamsarakan performed extraordinary \nheroic deeds. Three times in a single month he attacked the Persian troops. \nThe first time, he struck down half of the Persian army. The second time, \npursuing the Persians, he slaughtered one fourth of the soldiers. The third \ntime, he destroyed one eleventh of the Persian army. The Persians who were \nstill alive, numbering two hundred eighty, fled to Nakhichevan. And so, from \nthis remainder, find how many Persian soldiers there were before the massacre.\n\nProblem 8\n\nDuring the famous Armenian uprising against the Persians, when Zaurak\nKamsarakan killed Suren, one of the Armenian azats[4] sent an envoy to the\nPersian king to report the baleful news. The envoy covered fifty miles in a \nday. Fifteen days later, when he learned of this, Zaurak Kamsarakan sent \nriders in pursuit to bring the envoy back. The riders covered eighty miles in \na day. And so, find how many days it took them to catch the envoy.\n\nProblem 18 mentions vessels made of varying amounts of metal. In the Russian \ntranslation, they are all called "dishes." But in the original Armenian, \naccording to Orbeli's note, the dishes in the first and second instances are \ncalled mesur, and in the third instance scutel. Scutel is a common Armenian \nword, but mesur had not been encountered in Armenian literature before \nAnania's Problems and Solutions.\n\nProblem 18\n\nThere was a tray in my house. I melted it down and made other vessels from the \nmetal. From one third I made a mesur; from one fourth, another mesur; from\none fifth, two goblets; from one sixth, two scutels; and from two hundred ten \ndrams, I made a bowl. And now, find the weight of the tray.\n\nSeveral of the problems reflect the richness of the Caucasian fauna in \nAnania's time -- for instance, problem 7.\n\nProblem 7\n\nOnce I was in Marmet, the capital of the Kamsarakans. Strolling along the bank \nof the river Akhuryan, I saw a school of fish and ordered that a net be cast. \nWe caught a half and a quarter of the school, and all the fishes that slipped\nout of the net ended up in a creel. When I looked in the creel, I found \nforty-five fishes. And now, find how many fishes here were in all.\n\nThe temptation is great to present all 24 problems. But I'll restrain myself\nand offer you just one more.\n\nProblem 20 provides some interesting information about the wild animals that \ninhabited Armenia at one time but now extinct for so long that there is no\nmention of them even in zoological reference books. The wild donkey, according \nto the generally accepted view, never roamed the Armenian lands. Yet Anania of \nShirak offers evidence to the contrary .\n\nProblem 20\n\nThe hunting preserve of Nersekh Kamsarakan, ter[5] of Shirak and Asharunik, \nwas at the base of the mountain called Artin. One night great herds of wild\ndonkey entered the preserve. The hunters could not cope with the donkeys and, \nrunning to the village of Talin, told Nersekh about them. When he arrived with\nhis brothers and azats and entered the preserve, they began killing the wild \nbeasts. Half of the animals were caught in traps, one fourth were killed by \narrows. The young, which constituted one twelfth of all the animals, were \ncaught alive, and three hundred sixty wild donkeys were killed by spears. And \nso, find how many beasts there were at the start of this massacre.\n\n		"Set in type by me, Iosef Orbeli"\n\n	His biography could not be squeezed into the framework of a \n	bibliography.\n				-- K Uzbashyan, Academician\n					Iosef Abgarovich Orbeli\n\nAnyone who is lucky enough to hold a copy (1/n of the small printing--n is the \nsolution to the epigraph in the previous section) of the Russian translation \nof Anania of Shirak's Problems and Solutions, a thin book with yellowed pages,\nhas probably noticed the variety of the fonts, the elegance of the borders, \nand the high quality of the design, printing, and binding. Such great \nattention to detail is characteristic of works that fulfill a requirement for \na degree in bookmaking. And this problem book was indeed a kind of diploma \nattesting to the professional maturity of the man who created it. An \nadvertisement at the end of the book reads: "This book was typeset in \nDecember 1917 at the printing offices of the Russian Academy of Sciences by \nme, Iosef Orbeli; the text was also proofread, laid out, and decorated with \nborders by me. Various circumstances prevented me from carrying this project \nto the end; the final pages of the book were typeset by M. Strolman."\n\nTypesetting was neither the first nor the only profession of the renowned \norientalist Iosef Orbeli, who later became the director of the Hermitage \nMuseum in Leningrad. He was also a cabinetmaker and a locksmith. Orbeli had \nalready become acquainted with the famous academic printing house Typis \nAcademiae, founded in 1728 and known all over the scientific world for its \nrich collection of fonts and its virtuoso typesetters. In preparing to publish \nthe corpus of ancient inscriptions preserved on the walls of Armenian \nchurches, Orbeli found it necessary to create a new font that would preserve \nthe unique signs and ligatures. This complicated work was done by M. G.\nStrolman. (Unfortunately the entire set of letters was destroyed during the \nblockade of Leningrad in World War II.)\n\nWhen Orbeli came to the printing offices of the Academy of Sciences, times \nwere hard. The only way to publish the newly translated Problems of Anania\nwas for Orbeli to learn typesetting (he had always been attracted to the \nprinter's craft). In 1922 Orbeli became the director of printing at the \nAcademy of Sciences. Even after he retired, he remained a tireless champion\nof Russian academic typography.\n\n			Back to Earth\n\n	This book by definition does not exhaust all the most important \n	works in this domain. The editor hopes that those who are guilty \n	of this incompleteness will read these lines and, stung by shame, \n	will work up, if not a collection like this, at least a monograph.\n\n			--V.

Maybe one of the space travelers will take \nthis very copy of Quantum, and another, looking over her shoulder, will read \nthis article and say to himself: "This Anania from Shirak seems like a pretty \ninteresting guy. When I get home I'll try to find his problems."\n\nGood luck, my young friend! Anania is sure to entertain you. Perhaps by then\nthere will be more than n copies of his timeless Problems and Solutions.

Right now, I'm just going to address this point.\nWhen the Jewish National Fund bought most of its land,\nIt didn't buy it from the Palestinians themselves, because,\nfor the most part, they were tenant farmers (fallahin),\nliving on land owned by wealthy Arabs in Syria and Lebanon.\nThe JNF offered a premium deal, so the owners took advantage of\nit.   It's called commerce.  The owners, however, made no \nprovisions for those who had worked for them, basically shafting \nthem by selling the land right out from under them.\nThey are to blame, not the Jews.
This could be accomplished by other criteria.  One must remember\nthat children often bring stress into households. As an alternative,\none could consider financial incentives for every sexual act performed\nby two partners of different ethnic backgrounds.  The plan could\nbe entitled "PEACE INCOME SEXUAL SECURITY", or PISS for short.\n\nEvery time an Israeli gets screwed\nby a Palestinian or visa versa, they would be eligible for income.\nIn keeping with the spirit of the times, condoms would be a tax deductible\nexpense.  This policy does not discriminate on a gender basis nor\nwould it apply to domestic animals of either nationality.\n\nJoint Palestinan-Israeli teams would be obligated to ensure that all\nacts were voluntary and promptly rewarded. The teams of Palestinian-Israel\nMorals Patrols, or PIMPS, would receive a percentage of the financial\nincome in order to encourage their participation and add to their\nincentive in locating suitable candidates.\n\n                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nShouldn't that be insemination?
I do (did) contribute to the ARF mortgage fund but when interest\nrates plumetted, I just paid it off.\n\nThe problem is, I couldn't convince Congress to move my home to \na nicer location on Federal land.\n\nBTW, even though the building is alleged to be funded by tax exempt\nprivate funds, the maintainence and operating costs will be borne by \ntaxpayers forever.\n\nWould anyone like to guess how much that will come to and tell us why\nthis point is never mentioned?
"fete"??? Since this word both formally and commonly refers to\npositive/joyous events, your misuse of it here is rather unsettling.\n \n\nI certainly abhor those Israeli policies and attitudes that are\nabusive towards the Palestinians/Gazans. Given that, however, there \n*is no comparison* between the reality of the Warsaw Ghetto and in \nGaza.  \n\nJust as international law recognizes the right of the occupying \nentity to maintain order, especially in the face of elements\nthat are consciously attempting to disrupt the civil structure. \nIronically, international law recognizes each of these focusses\n(that of the occupied and the occupier) even though they are \ninherently in conflict.\n\nIsrael certainly cannot, and should not, continue its present\npolicies towards Gazan residents. There is, however, a third \nalternative- the creation and implementation of a jewish "dhimmi"\nsystem with Gazans/Palestinians as benignly "protected" citizens.\nWould you find THAT as acceptable in that form as you do with\nregard to Islam's policies towards its minorities?\n \n\nIt is a race, then? Between Israel's anti-Palestinian/Gazan\n"Final Solution" and the Arab World's anti-Israel/jewish\n"Final Solution". Do you favor one? neither? \n\nSince there is justifiable worry by various parties that Israel\nand Arab/Palestinian "final solution" intentions exist, isn't it\nimportant that BOTH Israeli *and* Palestinian/Gazan "rights"\nbe secured?
Attacking? Who is attacking who? Even the country you live in,USA, have condemned\n	Armenia for it's attacking.

Armenians lived in\n	harmony with the Azeris until "Gorbatjov and co." gave "freedom" to the people\n	in Karabag, then the Armenians started to kill, rape and torture the Azeris, not only\n	in Karabag but also noe in Azerbadjan....\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n	|>It's too bad you would want Turkey to start a war with Armenia.	\n 		\n	  That's what i don't want, you couldn't imagine the result of a war.....\n	  So France, Greece and  USA wants to start fighting with Azerbadjan???? \n	  They give a lot more weapons to the Armenians without \n	  saying it, that's no secret any more......\n\n\n	  I must say that these Armenian Government is very shortsighted.\n	  Do they think that they shall move from it's neigbours when the war\n 	  is over???? The neighbour around will be there and Armenia must 	 \n	  live in harmony with these if they don't want a "stone-age" country,\n	  for that's what's will happen Armenia if the wars continues.\n	\n	  Look, The President of Turkey, Turgut Ozal, died and  Petrosyan\n	  the Armenian Presindent is now in Turkey for the funeral. Is it because\n	  he liked him? Sure NOT, because Armenia needs it's neighbours and must\n	  live with these. But Armenia can't stop this war with continued ordertaking\n	  from states like France and USA. With other words, if you love your people\n	  you must think twice.....\n\n	  And i wonder, "Shoot down turkish planes" WITH WHAT????? ohhh i forgot\n	  the Armenians can't find food but there are a lot of arms from the mentioned\n	  countries.....

Shaw  (History),  who  recently\ncompleted  two books:  The Jews  of  the Ottoman  Empire and  the\nTurkish Republic, and Turkey and  the Holocaust: Turkey's Role in\nRescuing  Turkish  and  European  Jewry  from  Nazi  Persecution,\n1933-45. Shaw  chairs the undergraduate  interdepartmental degree\nprogram in Near Eastern Studies and has organized the Program for\nthe Study of Ottoman and Turkish Jewry. He is affiliated with the\nG. E. von Grunebaum Center for Near Eastern Studies.\n\nEditor: How did  you come to write these two  books on Turkey and\nEuropean and Turkish Jews?\n\nShaw: Basically, I'm  an Ottoman historian, but  I'm also Jewish.\nI've  spent twenty-five  years studying  Ottoman history,  and as\ntime went along, whenever I  found materials on the Ottoman Jews,\nI collected  them. But  I never  did anything  with them  until a\ncouple of years  ago, when I suddenly realized that  1992 was the\n500th  anniversary of  the  Jews being  expelled  from Spain  and\ncoming  to Turkey.  Then the  Sephardic Temple  down on  Wilshire\nAvenue invited me  to give a series of three  lectures on Ottoman\nJewry.  These lectures  were  greatly appreciated,  and I  became\nmotivated to  undertake further research  to develop a  book, The\nJews of the  Ottoman Empire and the Turkish)  Republic. This book\nis quite different from the  works of most Jewish historians, who\ntend to look  at the Jews in any country  more from the viewpoint\nof the Jews  and the Jewish community, and rely  mainly on Jewish\nsources.  I  view my  subject  as  an  Ottoman historian,  and  I\napproach the Jews of the Ottoman Empire largely from the point of\nview of Ottoman  society, using largely Ottoman  sources. After I\nfinished  this book  and  sent it  to the  press,  I came  across\nadditional documents  relating to  Turkish Jews during  World War\nII. In the completed book, I had said that Turkey had done a good\ndeal  to rescue  the Jews  during  World War  II, but  I did  not\nactually have many details. Then I  found a batch of documents in\nthe Foreign Ministry archive relating to actions taken by Turkish\ndiplomats to  help the Jews  before and during the  Holocaust. It\nwas too late to add this new information to the book in press, so\nI decided to  write a second book. I  conducted further research,\nmainly in the archives of the  Foreign Ministry in Ankara and the\nTurkish Embassy and Consulate in Paris. The result was the second\nbook, Turkey and  the Holocaust, which details  how Turkey helped\nrescue Jews from the Nazis.\n\n- How exactly did they do this?\n\nThe story takes  place over a number of years.  The book presents\nthe material in three parts, first of which deals with the period\nbefore the Holocaust. When the Nazis  came to power in Germany in\n1933,  they immediately  started  dismissing  Jews and  anti-Nazi\nGermans from universities,  hospitals, scientific institutes, and\nthe like. Turkey at that moment was just beginning the process of\nreforming its  universities, and it  saw in these Jews,  who were\nbeing fired from their positions in Germany, a good source of new\ntalent to  help modernize the Turkish  universities. Within three\nmonths  after the  Nazis  started dismissing  these Jews,  Turkey\narranged to take many of them in. They were brought to Turkey and\nwere   given   appointments   as  professors   in   the   Turkish\nuniversities, as  heads of scientific institutes,  and as medical\npersonnel in hospitals. About 300  to 500 major Jewish professors\ncame to  Turkey in  the 1930s. Ernst  Reuter, a  German political\nscientist,  spent the  war  years teaching  political science  in\nTurkey. After  World War II,  he was  mayor of Berlin  during the\nBerlin Airlift.  Fritz Neimark, a major  German Jewish economist,\ncame to Turkey and helped  establish a modern school of economics\nin Istanbul.  A man named  Reichenbach, who was rescued  from the\nNazis by  Turkey and  spent the war  years in  Turkey, eventually\ncame to  UCLA, where he  became a professor of  philosophy. Other\nGerman Jewish  emigres engaged in cultural  activities in Turkey.\nOne  such was  Karl  Ebert,  who had  been  a leading  theatrical\nproducer in Berlin until he was expelled by the Nazis. He went to\nTurkey, where he  organized the Turkish National  Theater and the\nTurkish National Opera  Company in Ankara, with the  help of Paul\nHindemuth. So  the first  section of the  book covers  this first\nphase, when Jews were being  persecuted in Germany and rescued by\nTurkey.  Oddly enough,  the  German emigres,  when  they were  in\nTurkey, did not seem to think too badly of Germany. They regarded\nthemselves more  as Germans than Jews,  and they did not  join in\nthe anti-Nazi activities of the local Turkish Jewish community. I\neven  found  letters  from  the Nazi  representatives  to  Turkey\npraising these German Jewish refugees for their work in promoting\nthe idea  of German  culture. Even though  these people  had been\npersecuted by the Nazis and rescued by the Turks, they shared the\nNazis' feelings of  Aryan racial superiority over  the Turks. The\nsecond part of the book deals  with the Holocaust, which began in\n1940 when the Nazis occupied France.  In Europe at that time, and\nespecially in France, there were  about 20,000 Turkish Jews. They\nhad migrated to Europe for various reasons from about the turn of\nthe century onward. Most of them had settled in Europe during the\nTurkish war for  independence after World War I,  when Greece was\nthreatening to overrun Turkey. The Greeks had persecuted the Jews\nthroughout the nineteenth century, and the Jews feared what might\nhappen to them if the Greeks  took over in Turkey. Many Jews fled\nto France during  the 1920s and 1930s. Many  also abandoned their\nTurkish  citizenship and  became  French  citizens. Suddenly  the\nNazis invaded France in 1940 and started introducing all sorts of\nanti-Jewish laws.  The Turkish  Jews soon found  that it  was not\nworth very much to  be a French Jew, but that it  was worth a lot\nto be a Turkish Jew.\n\n- How so?\n\nTurkey remained neutral through most of World War II. It retained\nits embassies  and consulates in all  the Nazi-occupied countries\nuntil it finally entered the war on the side of the Allies at the\nend of 1944. During the war,  therefore, Turkey was in a position\nto  defend its  citizens  against anti-Jewish  measures, and  the\nactions that  Turkish diplomats took  form the second  chapter of\nthe  book. Turkish  diplomats  who were  stationed  in France  in\nparticular intervened to protect Jews of Turkish citizenship from\nthe Nazis. For those Turkish  Jews who had retained their Turkish\ncitizenship,  there  was  generally  no  problem.  If  they  were\narrested and sent to a  concentration camp, the Turkish diplomats\nwould  communicate with  the  commanders of  the  camp and  other\nofficials and say in effect:  "These people are Turkish citizens.\nYou  can't do  this  to  them." And  the  Turkish  Jews would  be\nreleased.  If  their  businesses were  confiscated,  the  Turkish\ndiplomats would protest and the businesses would be restored.\n\nThe Nazis  in general  wanted to keep  the friendship  of Turkey.\nThey hoped to be able to use  Turkey as a gateway for an invasion\nof the Middle  East, and they also wanted to  obtain chromium and\nmanganese from Turkey. In order  to keep Turkish friendship, they\nusually accepted  these interventions on behalf  of Turkish Jews.\nThe Turkish  diplomats sometimes went to  the concentration camps\nto secure the release of Turkish Jews. At times they even boarded\ntrains hauling  Turkish Jews  to Auschwitz for  extermination and\nsucceeded in getting them off the train. Most of the foreign Jews\nwere sent  to a concentration  camp at  a place called  Drancy in\nParis,  and that's  where  most of  the  intercession by  Turkish\nconsuls took place.\n\nThe greater problem came with  the Turkish Jews who had abandoned\ntheir  Turkish citizenship  and had  become French  citizens. The\nconsuls couldn't declare that  these people were Turkish citizens\nbecause  they were  not.  My book  includes  photographs of  Jews\nlining  up in  front  of  the Turkish  consulate,  either to  get\npassports to  return to Turkey or  to get a restoration  of their\nTurkish  citizenship.   This  was   a  bureaucratic   matter,  so\nprocessing the application would take  some time. In the meantime\nit was a  real emergency, because the Nazis would  arrest Jews on\nthe streets for almost nothing.  The Nazis would even arrest them\nif they  had radios  or telephones  in their  apartments, because\nradios and  telephones were  forbidden to Jews.  To take  care of\nthese  former  Turkish Jews,  the  Turkish  diplomats invented  a\ndocument called  gayri muntazem  vatandash, or  "irregular fellow\ncitizen." The  document said in  effect "This person is  a former\nTurkish  citizen  who has  applied  for  the restoration  of  his\nTurkish citizenship.  In the meantime  we would appreciate  it if\nyou  would treat  him  as  if he  were  a  Turkish citizen."  The\ndiplomats wrote  the document in  Turkish and put their  seals on\nit. Since  the Nazis could  not read  Turkish, on the  whole they\naccepted  these papers  as certificates  of citizenship.  By this\nmeans, the  Turkish diplomats were  able to rescue many  Jews who\nhad relinquished their Turkish citizenship.\n\nActually the Nazis were of two minds about the Turkish defense of\nJews. On the one hand the  Nazi Foreign Ministry, which wanted to\nretain the friendship of Turkey,  was in favor of accepting these\ninterventions. On the other hand, Himmler and Eichmann wanted all\nJews exterminated.  At times  Himmler and  Eichmann were  able to\nprevail and some  of the Turkish Jews were sent  off to Auschwitz\nbefore the Turkish consuls could do anything.\n\n- Do you have statistics on how many Turkish Jews were rescued?\n\nThere were about  20,000 Turkish Jews in Europe  before world War\nII,  about 10,000  of whom  were living  in France.  Most of  the\ninformation in this section of  the book relates to the situation\nin France. I have published  the letters that the Turkish consuls\nsent to  the Nazi  officials and  the letters  that came  back in\nreply. Generally the Nazis said  that if the Turkish consul would\npresent  documents  certifying   that  arrested  individuals  are\nTurkish citizens,  and promise  to send them  out of  France, the\nNazis would release them from the concentration camp. The Turkish\nconsuls also organized  special trains to take  Turkish Jews from\nNazi-occupied  territory   back  to  Turkey.  These   trains  ran\nregularly in 1943 and 1944. The Nazis gave the Turkish Jews visas\nso they  could pass out  of Nazi  territory, but the  trains were\noften  held  up by  the  Nazi-influenced  governments of  Eastern\nEurope  -   Croatia,  Serbia,   and  Bulgaria  -   because  these\ngovernments really didn't want the Jews to escape. As a result of\nthe Turkish consuls' efforts, about 3,000 to 4,000 of the Turkish\nJews  in  France were  saved.  Another  3,000  were sent  off  to\nAuschwitz, where  most of them  died. The remaining  3,000 either\nescaped  across the  border into  Spain or  fled to  the area  of\nsouthern France occupied  by the Italians, who  treated Jews much\nbetter than  the Nazis did.  At the  end of 1943,  however, Italy\nfell out of the war, and that was the end for those Jews as well.\nIncidentally, the Turkish diplomats  in Nazi-occupied Greece also\nworked to rescue Jews in that country.\n\n- The second part of your  book then deals with Turkish diplomats\nacting to  rescue Jews of  Turkish citizenship or  Turkish origin\nfrom Nazi persecution.\n\nYes,  and  there  is  an  aside   I  might  add  here:  In  their\ninterventions on  behalf of Turkish  Jews, the Turks  cited their\ntreaty with Germany which stated  that Turkish citizens in German\nterritory would be treated the same as German citizens in Turkey.\nOn  that basis  the Turks  maintained  that the  Nazis could  not\ndiscriminate  against Turkish  citizens who  are Jews.  The Nazis\nclaimed  (and the  Vichy government  agreed) that  they were  not\ndiscriminating  because  they  were treating  all  Jews  equally.\nTurkey  protested,   saying,  "You  are  dividing   our  citizens\naccording to religion, but the Turkish constitution requires that\nall  citizens   be  treated  equally,  regardless   of  religion.\nTherefore, you cannot single  out Turkish Jews." American consuls\nin  Paris,  by contrast,  accepted  the  Nazi argument  and  told\nAmerican Jews  who were being  persecuted by the Nazis  that they\ncouldn't do  anything about  it, because  the American  Jews were\nbeing treated the same as other  Jews. The third part of the book\ntakes place in Turkey, which  was the principal center during the\nHolocaust for activities aimed at  the rescue of Eastern European\nJews. The  kwish Agency, an  organization established by  Jews in\nPalestine to help resettle Jews to Palestine, set up an office in\nIstanbul  in 1940  under the  leadership of  Chaim Barlas.  Other\nJewish organizations in Palestine, especially the kibbutzes, also\nsent representatives  to Istanbul  to set up  headquarters. These\ngroups first tried to contact Jews  in Eastern Europe to find out\nwhat was  happening. Today  we know about  the Holocaust,  but at\nthat  time people  didn't know  what  was going  on. They  didn't\nimagine the Nazis could do the things they were doing. And so the\nfirst step was to get information, and the Turkish government let\nthem use the Turkish mails to send letters to their relatives and\nfriends  in Eastern  Europe. The  Jewish organizations  found out\nwhat was happening when they  received replies. Later on when the\nNazis  began  to  intercept   such  letters,  the  Jews  received\nassistance  also from  the  Vatican nuncio,  Angelo Roncali,  who\nserved as  the Vatican  representative in  Istanbul from  1935 to\n1944  and   later  became  Pope   John  XXIII.  As   the  Vatican\nrepresentative  during the  war, he  used the  facilities of  the\nCatholic  Church to  supplement what  the Turkish  government was\ndoing to  assist Jewish  agencies in  contacting Jews  in Eastern\nEurope.  With the  cooperation of  the Turkish  government, these\nagencies  then  sent  hard  currency, food,  clothing,  and  even\nrailroad  and  steamship  tickets   to  Jews  in  Czechoslovakia,\nBulgaria, Romania, and Hungary. They weren't able to help much in\nPoland because  by then the  Nazis had  wiped out almost  all the\nPolish Jews.  Whenever possible the rescue  agencies arranged for\nthe Jews to get out of Eastern Europe either by train through the\nso called  Orient Express route  to Istanbul, or by  boat through\nthe Black Sea to Istanbul.\n\nTurkey was not eager for all  these refugees to remain within its\nborders during  the war, because  it was being blockaded  and was\nsuffering   terrible  shortages   of  food   and  clothing.   The\ngovernment,   therefore,   facilitated   the  movement   of   the\nnon-Turkish Jewish  refugees from Turkey to  Palestine, either by\nthe Taurus  Express Railroad through  the mountains to  Syria and\nPalestine,  or by  small boats  across the  eastern Mediterranean\nfrom southern  Turkey to  Palestine. These efforts  were bitterly\nopposed not only  by the Nazis, but also by  the British, who did\nnot want  any more Jewish  immigration to Palestine  because they\nfeared it would hurt their  relations with the Arabs. The British\nconstantly pressured the Turkish  government to stop this traffic\nand send those Jews back. In  a few cases the Turkish government,\nyielding  to  British pressure,  did  send  the boats  back.  For\nexample, in  one incident,  the steamship  Struma, with  some 700\nJewish  refugees  from Romania,  was  sent  back by  the  Turkish\ngovernment  as  a  result  of the  intervention  of  the  British\nambassador. When  that ship was  sunk by a Soviet  submarine, all\nwere lost except one person.  Nevertheless, all told, the Turkish\ngovernment allowed no fewer than 100,000 Eastern European Jews to\npass through  Turkish territory and  move on to  Palestine during\nthe Second World War. The Turkish authorities also provided these\nrefugees with facilities  and money, and gave  them permission to\nsend money and food out of the country.\n\n- Many  of these  Jews who  passed  through Turkey  may still  be\nliving in Israel.\n\nYes, and  their children. But  let's return  for a moment  to the\nfirst group, the Turkish Jews who  came from Europe. They did not\ngo  on  to   Palestine;  they  stayed  in  Turkey.   It  was  the\nnon-Turkish, Eastern  European Jews who passed  through Turkey en\nroute to Palestine. Their story is very interesting.\n\n- And you have rescued it from obscurity.\n\nMany studies have been made of the Holocaust, but most of them do\nnot focus on the Eastern European or Middle Eastern Jews. Most of\nthe scholarship  has centered  on the  Western European  Jews, of\nwhom 6 million were massacred by the Nazis. My study deals with a\nmuch smaller  number of  people. I  have tried  to round  out the\npicture,  and I  hope my  book  will persuade  other scholars  to\nundertake further investigations in the history of Eastern Jews.\n\nWhen it  comes to numbers,  the German Jews were  also relatively\nsmall in number. Most of the millions slain were Polish Jews. The\nrescue  of  100,000  Eastern  European   Jews  may  not  seem  so\nsignificant  compared  with  the  total of  6  million  who  were\nmurdered, but it meant a lot to those who were saved.\n\nAbout  three-fourths   of  the  book  consists   of  documents  -\ntranslations  of many  documents. They  are included  because the\nstory is not well known. Not  only are people in the West unaware\nof  the courageous  actions of  the Turkish  diplomats; even  the\npeople of Turkey  did not know the story. I  felt that they would\nnot  fully understand  this  remarkable  achievement unless  they\ncould see the documents.\n\n- What languages are used in the documents?\n\nMost of them are in Turkish  or French; some are in Hebrew. There\nis a great  deal of material in Hebrew about  the organization of\nthe boats  going to Palestine, the  passengers, and so on,  but I\ndid not go into those details extensively. I describe mostly what\nTurkey did, so  most of my documents are in  Turkish or French. A\nfew documents are  in English. The Jewish groups  in Istanbul did\nnot necessarily  cooperate with  one another  to rescue  Jews; in\nfact, they often fought with  one another. They took turns trying\nto  get  the  Turkish  government to  deport  rival  groups.  For\nexample, some of  the kibbutz groups felt that  the Jewish Agency\nwas  run by  Western European  Jews who  were interested  only in\nhelping  Western  European  Jews.  Finally,  in  1944,  President\nRoosevelt sent a personal  representative, Ira Hirschman, who had\nbeen an executive of Bloomingdale's  department store in New York\nCity, and  Hirschman managed to reconcile  their differences. The\ndocuments related to his mission are in English.\n\nI also obtained many documents  from Serge Klarsfeld, a Holocaust\nhistorian in France,  who mainly worked on the  French Jews. (His\nfather was  killed by  the Nazis.)  He gave  me materials  he had\ngathered in the German archives on  the Turkish Jews, so I didn't\npersonally consult the German archives.  I believe that much more\ncan  be learned  from the  German  archives, and  I hope  someone\nsomeday will make the effort.\n\n- This new book fits in well with your teaching, doesn't it?\n\nRight. I'm  giving a  course on  the history of  the Jews  of the\nOttoman  Empire.  I first  gave  the  course  two years  ago.  In\naddition to  research, writing, and teaching,  I've been actively\ninvolved in  the commemoration  of the  500th anniversary  of the\ncoming of the  Jews to the Ottoman Empire. Among  other things, I\nhelped organize  a large international conference  on the subject\nwhich was held in Istanbul in 1992.\n\n- Now that your  books are finished and the  conference has taken\nplace, what do you plan to do next?\n\nI'm working on two new books. One is a history of the Turkish War\nfor Independence, which took place  after World War I, during the\nyears  1918 to  1923. The  Turks warded  off the  efforts of  the\nvictorious  European   powers  to  occupy  Turkey   and  end  its\nindependence. The  second book is  a study of Sultan  Abdul Hamid\nII, the last major sultan, who ruled from 1876 to 1909. He was an\nimportant modernizer in his own  way, although he also suppressed\nall sorts of political movements.\n\nStanford  J. Shaw  received  a B.A.  in History  and  an M.A.  in\nBritish History. He then shifted to Near Eastern History, earning\na second M.A.  and a Ph.D. at Princeton. As  a doctoral candidate\nat Princeton, he  spent two years abroad, studying  at the School\nof  Oriental  and  African  Studies, University  of  London;  the\nUniversity of  Cairo, the American  University at Cairo,  and the\nUniversity of  Istanbul. He  taught at  Harvard before  coming to\nUCLA in 1966. His postdoctoral research has been supported by the\nJohn Simon Guggenheim Foundation, the American Research Institute\nin  Turkey, the  Social  Science Research  Council, the  National\nEndowment for the Humanities, the Fulbright Program, and ISOP. He\nhas  received  honorary  degrees   from  Harvard  University  and\nBosporus University, Bebek, Istanbul, Turkey, and medals of honor\nfor lifetime contributions  to the fields of  Islamic and Turkish\nstudies from the Center for Research in Islamic History, Art, and\nCulture in  Istanbul and from  the American Friends of  Turkey in\nWashington,  D.C. In  addition to  undertaking many  professional\nservice activities and public lectures  in both the United States\nand Turkey,  Shaw has  also produced eight  books and  one edited\nvolume. His  History of  the Ottoman Empire  and Modem  Turkey (2\nvols.)  has been  published  in many  editions  (six editions  or\nreprints  from 1977-1991),  and  translated  into Turkish  (1983,\n1991) and French (1984). His book  The Jews of the Ottoman Empire\nand  the  Turkish  Republic  (MacMillan,  London,  and  New  York\nUniversity Press, 1992) will  be published in Turkish translation\nby the Turkish  Historical Society, Istanbul. His  Turkey and the\nHolocaust: Turkey's  Role in Rescuing Turkish  and European Jewry\nfrom Nazi  Persecution, 1933-1945 will be  published by Macmillan\nPublishers,  London, and  New York  University Press  in 1993.  A\npamphlet summarizing the book was published in Ankara, Turkey, in\n1992.\n\nSerdar Argic
Based on the same reasons?  You mean you were opposed to US intervention in\nSomalia because since Somalia is a European country instead of the third world,\nthe desire to help Somalia is racist?  I don't think this "same reason" applies\nto Somalia at all.\n\nThe whole point is that Somalia _is_ a third world country, and we were more\nwilling to send troops there than to Bosnia--exactly the _opposite_ of what\nthe "fixation on European countries" theory would predict.  (Similarly, the\ndesire to help Muslims being fought by Christians is also exactly the opposite\nof what that theory predicts.)\n\n\nI'm referring to people who want to help at all, of course.  You don't see\npeople sending out press releases "help Bosnian Serbs with ethnic cleansing!\nThe Muslim presence in the Balkans should be eliminated now!"  (Well, except\nfor some Serbs, but I admit that the desire of Serbs in America to help the\nSerbian side probably _is_ because those are people more like them.)\n--\n"On the first day after Christmas my truelove served to me...

If you recall, a subject was raised some weeks ago that touched upon\nthis.  When someone claimed that guerillas were manifestations of\npopular sentiment, the topic arose:"When does a civilian stop\nbecoming a civilian?".  If he houses and shelters guerillas of\nhis own free will, aiding them, has he violated his "civilian" status?\n\n\nBut don't you see that the same statement can be made both ways?\nIf Lebanon was interested in peace then it should accept the word\nof Israel that the attacks were the cause for war and disarming the\nHizbollah will remove the cause for its continued occupancy.  Afterall,\nIsrael has already staged two parts of the withdrawal from areas\nit occupied in Lebanon during SLG.\n\n\nThat is not exactly true.  The Hizbollah and their affiliated groups\nhave made several attempts to infiltrate the border of Israel.\n\n\nTrue, but the Syrians did allow (until at least 1984) guerillas to operate\nin the areas that were under their control, provided that those guerillas\nwere attacking Israeli lines.\n\nThe problem is that Syria is also not as stable a partner for long term\npeace as others in the area might be.
I wouldn't bet on it.\n\nArab governments generally don't care much about the Palestineans and\ntheir struggle but find it useful for political purposes back home.\nThey are happy to leave the Palestineans largely under Israeli control\nbecause that leaves the job of controlling them to the Israelis.  The\nIsraelis don't like this job any more than King Hussein of Jordan\nliked it -- and he managed to kill them off at the rate of thousands\nper month when they started an Intifada in Jordan.  The governments of\nSyria, Lebanon and Egypt all feel similarly.  However, proclaiming\npublic support for the Palestinean war against Israel deflects\ncriticism from deep problems at home and lends an air of legitimacy to\neven the most brutal Arab tyrants.\n\nArab *PEOPLE* probably aren't much more sympathetic.  Palestineans\nhave shown a willingness to destabilize and plunder in Jordan,\nLebanon and Kuwait and are viewed with suspicion elsewhere.\n\nYou might still be right in sympathy to the war against Israel, but I\nsuspect that many Arabs, far removed from the immediate border with\nIsrael (e.g. in Kuwait or Morroco), couldn't care less.

These Jewish terrorist groups killed innocent British\nsoldiers, but not only thta also killed many Jews who were in\nfavor of a compromise with the Palestinians.  In addition, they\nmassacred an entire Palestinian village in 1948, contributing\nto the exodus of the frightened Palestinians who feared their\nvery lives.\n	I mention this not because I'm anti semitic [I'm part\nJewish] but because this self righteousness on the part of the\nIsraelites pisses me off so.  I'm not as critical of the\nPalestinians because they were indeed screwed over by the\nJews.  It 's a damn shame that the Palestinians had to pay for\nGerman and European anti semitism.
Are you trying to say that there were no massacres in Deir Yassin\n   or in Sabra and Shatila? If so then let me tell you some good jokes:\n\n   There is not and was not any such thing like jewish killing in WWII\n\n   Palestinians just did what Davidians did for fourty years and more.\n\n   In fact no one was killed in any war at any time or any place.\n\n   People die that is all. No one gets killed.\n\n   Maybe also vietamiese didn't die in Vietnam war killed by american\n   napalm they were just pyromaniacs and that's all.\n\n   Maybe jews just liked gas chambers and no one forced them to get in there.they \n   may be thought it was like snifing cocaine. No?\n\n   What do you think of this ? Isn't it stupid to say so?\n   Well it is as stupid as what you said .Next time you want to lie do it\n   intelligently.\n\n   Sincerely yours.\n\n   Hassan\n\nArab civilians did die at Dir yassin. But there was no massacre. First\nof all, the village housed many *armed* troops. Secondly, the Irgun\nand Stern fighters had absolutely no intentions of killing civilians.\nThe village was attacked only for its military significance. In fact,\na warning was given to the occupants of the village to leave before\nthe attack was to begin.\n\nBy all rational standards, Dir Yassin was not a massacre. The killing\nwas unintentional. The village housed Arab snipers and Arab troops.\nThus it was attacked for its military significance. It was not\nattacked with intentions of killing any civilians.\n\nTo even compare Dir Yassin, in which some 120 or so Arabs died, to the\nHolocaust is absurd. The Irgun did not want to kill any civilians. The\nvillage had almost 1000 inhabitants, most of whom survived.
massacre.\n\nAnswer: a(1-1/2-1/4-1/11)=280 -> a = 1760

Lebanese resistance forces detonated a bomb under an Israeli occupation\n   patrol in Lebanese territory two days ago. Three soldiers were killed and\n   two wounded. In "retaliation", Israeli and Israeli-backed forces wounded\n   8 civilians by bombarding several Lebanese villages. Ironically, the Israeli\n   government justifies its occupation in Lebanon by claiming that it is \n   necessary to prevent such bombardments of Israeli villages!!\n\n   Congratulations to the brave men of the Lebanese resistance! With every\n   Israeli son that you place in the grave you are underlining the moral\n   bankruptcy of Israel's occupation and drawing attention to the Israeli\n   government's policy of reckless disregard for civilian life.\n\n   Brad Hernlem (hernlem@chess.ncsu.EDU)\n\nVery nice. Three people are murdered, and Bradly is overjoyed. When I\nhear about deaths in the middle east, be it Jewish or Arab deaths, I\nfeel sadness, and only hope that soon this all stops. Apparently, my\nview point is not acceptable to people like you Bradly.\n\nHernlem, you disgust me.
Ok. My Aykut., what about the busload of Greek turists that was\ntorched, and all the the people in the buis died. Happened oh, about 5\nyears ago in Instanbul.\n	What about the Greeks in the islands of Imbros and tenedos, they\nare not allowed to have churches any more, instead momama turkey has\nturned the church into a warehouse, I got a picture too.\n	What about the pontian Greeks of Trapezounta and Sampsounta,\nwhat you now call Trabzon and Sampson, they spoke a 2 thousand year alod\nlanguage, are there any left that still speek or were they Islamicised?\n	Before we start another flamefest , and before you start quoting\nArgic all over again, or was it somebody else?, please think. I know it\nis a hard thing to do for somebody not equipped , but try nevertheless.\n	If Turks in Greece were so badly mistreated how come they\nelected two,m not one but two, representatives in the Greek government?\nHow come they have free(absolutely free) hospitalization and education?\nDo the Turks in Turkey have so much?If they do then you have every right\nto shout, untill then you can also move to Greece and enjoy those\nprivileges. But I forget , for you do study in a foreign university,\nsome poor shod is tiling the earth with his own sweat.\n	BTW is Aziz Nessin still writing poetry? I'd like to read some\nof his new stuff. Also who was the guy that wrote "On the mountains of\nTayros." ? please respond kindly to the last two questions, I am\ninterested in finding more books from these two people.
From _Myths and Facts_, by Leonard J. Davis, Near East Research Inc.,\n1989:\n\n[pp. 108-109]\n\n    "Unlike the PLO's almost exclusive focus on civilian targets, the\n100 troups from the Irgun and Stern group that struck at Deir Yassin\non April 10, 1948, targeted the village for its military importance.\nDeir Yassin was on the road to Jerusalem, which the Arabs had\nblockaded, and it housed Iraqi troups and Palestinian irregulars.\nSnipers based in Deir Yassin were a constant threat to Jewish citizens\nin Jerusalem.\n\n    "Arab civilians were killed at Deir Yassin, but that attack does\nnot conform to the propaganda picture that the Arabs have tried to\npaint. The number of Arabs killed was generally reported to be about\n250. In 1983, however, Eric Silver of _The Guardian_ (Britain)\ninterviewed a survivor, Mophammed Sammour, who testified that 116 out\nof a population of 800-1000 were killed. 'About three days after the\nmassacre,' Sammour explained, 'representatives of each of the five\nclans in Deir Yassin met at the Moslem offices in Jerusalem and made a\nlist of the people who had not been found (alive). We went through the\nnames.  Nothing has happend since 1948 to make me think this figure\nwas wrong.'

I don't know anything about this particular case, but *other*\ngovernments have been known to follow events on the Usenet.  For\nexample after Tienanmien Square in Beijing the Chinese government\nbegan monitoring cyberspace.  As the former Director of PeaceNet,\nI am aware of many incidents of local, state, national and\ninternational authorities monitoring Usenet and other conferences\nsuch as those on the Institute for Global Communications.  But\nwhat's the big deal?  You shouldn't advocate illegal acts in this\nmedium in any case.  If you are concerned about being monitored,\nyou should use encyrption software (available in IGC's "micro"\nconference).  I know for a fact that human rights activists in the\nBalkan-Mideast area use encryption software to send out their\nreports to international organizations.  Such message *can* be\ndecoded however by large computers consuming much CPU time, which\nprobably the Turkish government doesn't have access to.

(just an interrupting comment here) Since EARLY 1980's , israelis said they are \nwilling to give up the Adminstration rule of the occupied terretories to\nPalestineans. Palestineans refused and will refuse such settlement that denies\nthem their right of SELF-DETERMINATION. period.\n\n\nOk. I donot know why there are israeli voices against negotiations. However,\ni would guess that is because they refuse giving back a land for those who\nhave the right for it.\n\nAs for the Arabian and Palestinean voices that are against the\ncurrent negotiations and the so-called peace process, they\nare not against peace per se, but rather for their well-founded predictions\nthat Israel would NOT give an inch of the West bank (and most probably the same\nfor Golan Heights) back to the Arabs. An 18 months of "negotiations" in Madrid,\nand Washington proved these predictions. Now many will jump on me saying why\nare you blaming israelis for no-result negotiations.\nI would say why would the Arabs stall the negotiations, what do they have to\nloose ?\n\nArabs feel that the current "negotiations" is ONLY for legitimizing the current\nstatus-quo and for opening the doors of the Arab markets for israeli trade and\n"oranges". That is simply unacceptable and would be revoked. \n\nJust an opinion.

4/15/93 1242  Turkey sends light weapons as aid to Azerbaijan\n\nBy SEVA ULMAN\n   \nANKARA, Turkey (UPI) -- Turkey is arming Azerbaijan with light weapons to help\nit fight Armenian forces in the struggle for the Nagorno- Karabakh enclave, \nthe newspaper Hurriyet said Thursday.\n\nDeputy Prime Minister Erdal Inonu told reporters in Ankara that Turkey was\nresponding positively to a request from Azerbaijan for assistance.\n\n"We are giving a positive response to all requests" from Azerbaijan, "within\nthe limits of our capabilities," he said.\n\nForeign Ministry spokesman Vural Valkan declined to elaborate on the nature\nof the aid being sent to Azerbaijan, but said they were within the framework \nof the Council for Security and Cooperation in Europe.\n\nHurriyet, published in Istanbul, said Turkey was sending light weapons to\nAzerbaijan, including rockets, rocket launchers and ammunition.\n\nAnkara began sending the hardware after a visit to Turkey last week by a\nhigh-ranking Azerbaijani official. Turkey has however ruled out, for the second\ntime in one week, that it would intervene militarily in Azerbaijan.\n\nWednesday, Inonu told reporters Ankara would not allow Azerbaijan to suffer\ndefeat at the hands of the Armenians. "We feel ourselves bound to help\nAzerbaijan, but I am not in a position right now to tell you what form (that)\nhelp may take in the future," he said.\n\nHe said Turkish aid to Azerbaijan was continuing, "and the whole world knows\nabout it."\n\nPrime Minister Suleyman Demirel reiterated that Turkey would not get\nmilitarily involved in the conflict. Foreign policy decisions could not be \nbased on street-level excitement, he said.\n\nThere was no immediate reaction in Ankara to regional reports, based on\nArmenian sources in Yerevan, saying Turkish pilots and other officers were\ncaptured when they were shot down flying Azerbaijani warplanes and \nhelicopters.\n\nThe newspaper Cumhuriyet said Turkish troops were digging in along the border\nwith Armenia, but military sources denied reports based on claims by local\npeople that gunfire was heard along the border. No military action has \noccurred, the sources said.\n\nThe latest upsurge in fighting between the Armenians and Azerbaijanis flared\nearly this month when Armenian forces seized the town of Kelbajar and later\npositioned themselves outside Fizuli, near the Iranian border.
the question is by going East or West from the misisipi. on either choice\nyou would loose Palestine or Broklyn, N.Y.\n\nI thought you're gonna say fromn misisipi back to the misisipi !\n\n\nLet's say : " let's establish the islamic state first" or "let's free our\noccupied lands first". And then we can dream about expansion, Mr. Gideon
I have found Jewish people very imagentative and creative. Jewish religion was the foundation for Christianity and\nIslam.  In other words Judaism has fathered both religions. Now Islam has turned against its father I may say.\nIt is Ironic that after communizem threat is almost gone, religion wars are going to be on the raise. \nI thought the idea of believing on one God, was to Unite all man kind. How come both Jews and Islam which believe\non the same God, "the God of Ebrahim" are killing each other? Is this like Dr. Frankenstien's story?\nHow are you going to stop this from happening? How are you going to deal with so many Muslims. Nuking them \nwould distroy the whole world? Would God get mad, since you have killed his followers, you believe on the same\nGod, same heaven and the same hell after all? What is the peacefull way of ending this Saga?\n\n\nMan kind needs religion, since it sets up the rules and the regulations which keeps the society in a healthy state.\nA religion is mostly a sets of rules which people have experienced and know it works for the society.\nThe praying, keeps the sole healthy and meditates it. God does not care for man kinds pray, but man kind hopes\nthat God will help him when he prays.\nReligion works mostly on the moral issues and trys to put away the materialistic things in the life. But the \nreligious leaders need to make a living through religion? So they  may corrupt it, or turn it to their own way to\nmake their living. i.e Muslims have to pay  %20 percent of their income to the Mullahs. I guess the rabie  gets his\ncut too! \n\nIs in it that religion should be such that everybody on planet earth respects each other, be good toward each other\nhelps one another, respect the mother nature. Is in that heaven and hell are created on earth through the acts \nthat we take today?  Is in it that within every man there is good and bad, he could choose either one, then he will\nsee the outcome of his choice.  How can we prevent man kind from going crazy over religion. How can we stop\nanother religious killing field, under poor Gods name? What are your thoughts? Do you think man kind would\nto come its senses, before it is too late?\n\n\nP.S. on the side\n\nDo you think that Moses saw the God on mount Sina? Why would God go to top of the mountain? He created\nthe earth, he could have been anywhere? why on top the mountain? Was it because people thought to see God\nyou have to reach to the skies/heavens? Why God kept coming back to Middle East? Was it because they created\nGod through their imagination?  Is that why Jewish people were told by God, they were the chosen ones?\n\nProfit Mohammad was married to Khadijeh. She was a Jewish. She taught him how to trade. She probably taught\nhim about Judaism. Quran is mostly copy right of Taurah (sp? old testement). Do you think God wrote Quran?\nMakeh was a trade city before Islam. Do you think it was made to be the center of Islamic world because Mohammad\nwanted to expand his trade business? Is that why  God has put his house in there? \n\nI think this religious stuff has gone too far. All man kind are going to hurt from it if they do not wise up.\nLook at David Koresh, how that turned out? I am afraid in the bigger scale, the Jews and the Muslims will\nhave the same ending!!!!!!!!\n\nReligion is needed in the sense to keep people in harmony and keep them doing good things, rather than\nplotting each others distruction.  There is one earth, One life and one God. Let's all man kind be good toward\neach other.
Aryans who do not base their reasoning on Nazi ideology are racists...\n\nThus spoke an American citizen in the name of Judaism. If this is Judaism,\nI think Judaism should be combatted as any extremist and dangerous\nphilosophy.\n\nI suspect however that Martin Buber, Albert Einstein and other Jewish\nscholars would have rather converted to Christianity than stay Jews, if\nthey would have perceived Judaism as such a perverted philosophy.
Great interview with Benjamin Netanyahu on CNN - Larry King Live (4/15/93)\n   This guy is knows what he is talking about. He is truely charismatic,\n   articulate, intelligent, and demonstrates real leadership qualities. \n\nI agree, but I wish I liked his politics.
In today's Israeline posting, at the end (an afterthought?), I read:\n\n\nWhile I applaud investing of money in Yehuda, Shomron, v'Chevel-Azza,\nin order to create jobs for their residents, I find it deplorable that\nthis has never been an active policy of any Israeli administration\nsince 1967, *with regard to their Jewish residents*. Past governments\nfound funds to subsidize cheap (read: affordable) housing and the\nrequisite infrastructure, but where was the investment for creating\nindustry (which would have generated income *and* jobs)? \n\nAfter 26 years, Yehuda and Shomron remain barren, bereft of even \nmiddle-sized industries, and the Jewish settlements are sterile\n"bedroom communities", havens for (in the main) Israelis (both\nsecular *and* religious) who work in Tel-Aviv or Jerusalem but\ncannot afford to live in either city or their surrounding suburbs.\n\nThere's an old saying: "bli giboosh, ayn kivoosh" -- just living there\nwasn't enough, we had to *really* settle it. But instead, we "settled"\nfor Potemkin villages, and now we are paying the price (and doing\nfor others what we should have done for ourselves).
The problem if  transffering US government files about Yigal Arens\nand some other similar persons does or does not violate a federal\nor a local American law seemed to belong to some local american law\nforum  not to this forum.\nThe readers of this forum seemed to be more interested in the contents\nof those files.\nSo It will be nice if Yigal will tell us:\n1. Why do American authorities consider Yigal Arens to be dangerous?\n2. Why does the ADL have an interest in that person ?\n3. If one does trust either the US government or the ADL what an\n   additional information should he send them ?
Well, does it change the fact that during the period of 1914 to 1920, \nthe fascist x-Soviet Armenian Government ordered, incited, assisted \nand participated in the genocide of 2.5 million Muslim people because \nof race, religion and national origin?\n\nAs in the past in Turkiye, and today in Azerbaijan, for utopic and \nidiotic causes the Armenians brought havoc to their neighbors. A \nshort-sighted and misplaced nationalistic fervor with a wrong agenda \nand anachronistic methods the Armenians continue to become pernicious \nfor the region. As usual, they will be treated accordingly by their \nneighbors. Nagorno-Karabag is a mountainous enclave that lies completely \nwithin Azerbaijan with no border or history whatsoever connected to \nx-Soviet Armenia. Besides the geographical aspect, Nagorno-Karabag is \nthe historic homeland and the 'cradle' of the artistic and literary \nheritage of Azerbaijan, which renders the Armenian claims preposterous, \neven lunatic. \n\nAnd we still demand:\n\n1. that the x-Soviet Armenian Government, as the heirs of the Armenian \ndictatorship, recognize the Turkish Genocide;\n\n2. that x-Soviet Armenia return the historic homeland to the Turkish and\nKurdish people;\n\n3. that the x-Soviet Armenian Government make material reparations for their\nheinous and unspeakable crime to the victims of the Turkish Genocide;\n\n4. that all world governments officially recognize the Turkish Genocide \nand Turkish territorial rights and refuse to succumb to all Armenian \npolitical pressure.\n\nThe awareness of the Turkish people of the necessity of solidarity in the\nefforts to pursue the Turkish Cause is seen by the victims of the first \ngenocide of the 20th century as a positive step. \n\nNow what would you do? \n\nSource: 'The Sunday Times,' 1 March 1992 (a British Weekly, written by \n        Thomas Goltz, from Agdam, Azerbaijan.)\n\n    ARMENIAN SOLDIERS MASSACRE HUNDREDS OF FLEEING FAMILIES.\n\n    The spiralling  violence gripping the  outer republics of  the former\nSoviet Union gained new impetus  yesterday with cold-blooded slaughter of\nhundreds of women and children in war-racked Nagorno-Karabakh.\n    Survivors  reported that  Armenian soldiers  shot and  bayoneted more\nthan 450  Azeris, many of  them women and  children, who were  fleeing an\nattack  on their  town. Hundreds,  possibly thousands,  were missing  and\nfeared dead.\n    The attackers  killed most of  the soldiers and  volunteers defending\nthe women  and children.  They then  turned their  guns on  the terrified\nrefugees. The few  survivors later described what  happened:" That's when\nthe real  slaughter began," said  Azer Hajiev,  one of three  soldiers to\nsurvive. "The  Armenians just shot and  shot. And then they  came in and\nstarted carving up people with their bayonets and knives."\n    " They were shooting, shooting, shooting", echoed Rasia Aslanova, who\narrived in Agdam with other women and children who made their way through\nArmenian lines. She said her husband, Kayun, and a son-in-law were killed\nin front of her. Her daughter was still missing.\n    One boy who arrived in Agdam had an ear sliced off.\n\n    The survivors  said 2000  others, some of  whom had  fled separately,\nwere still missing in the gruelling terrain; many could perish from their\nwounds or the cold.\n    By late  yesterday, 479 deaths had  been registered at the  morgue in\nAgdam's morgue,  and 29 bodies  had been buried  in the cemetery.  Of the\nseven corpses  I saw awaiting  burial, two  were children and  three were\nwomen, one shot through the chest at point blank range.\n    Agdam hospital was  a scene of carnage and terror.  Doctors said they\nhad 140 patients who escaped slaughter, most with bullet injuries or deep\nstab wounds.\n    Nor were they safe in Agdam. On friday night rockets fell on the city\nwhich  has a  population  of 150,000,  destroying  several buildings  and\nkilling one person.\n\nSerdar Argic
In 1941, while the Jews were being assembled for their doom in the Nazi\nconcentration camps, the Nazi Armenians in Germany formed the first\nArmenian battalion to fight alongside the Nazis. In 1943, this battalion \nhad grown into eight battalions of 20,000-strong under the command of Dro \n(the butcher) who is the architect of the cold-blooded genocide of 2.5 \nmillion Turks and Kurds between 1914-1920. An Armenian National Council \nwas formed by the notorious Dashnak Party leaders in Berlin, which was \nrecognized by the Nazis. Encouraged by this, the Armenians summarily \nformed a provisional government that endorsed and espoused fully the \nprinciples of the Nazis and declared themselves as the members of the \nAryan super race and full participants to Hitler's policy of extermination \nof the Jews.\n\nThis Armenian-Nazi conspiracy against the Jews during WWII was an "encore"\nperformance staged by the Armenians during WWI, when they back-stabbed and\nexterminated 2.5 million Turks by colluding with the invading Russian army.\n\n\nSource: "Adventures in the Near East, 1918-1922" by A.

If you consider Israeli reporting of events in Israel to be propoganda, then \nconsider the Washington Post's handling of American events to be propoganda\ntoo.  What makes the Israeli press inherently biased in your opinion?  I\nwouldn't compare it to Nazi propoganda either.  Unless you want to provide\nsome evidence of Israeli inaccuracies or parallels to Nazism, I suggest you \nkeep your mouth shut.  I'm sick and tired of all you anti-semites comparing\nIsrael to the Nazis (and yes, in my opinion, if you compare Israel to the Nazis\nyou are an anti-semite because you know damn well it isn't true and you are\njust trying to discredit Israel).
Well said Mr. Beyer :)
So I should be very comfortable that 500,000,000 people want to convert me to\nIslam. Or, to convert me to ANYTHING. \n\nThere are many types of violence, physical murder is only one.\n\n'Trying' to convert is an insult. It's like trying to tell me that me and/or\nmy God/my lack of God are just crap, that I need a new, 'converted' one.\n\nThis does not apply for muslims only, of course. Same for jews and for some\nfriendly, nicely dressed neighbours who show on sunday with empty speaches\nand cheap booklets about some church ....\n\nAnd when the objective is (I think, however that you are wrong) to convert \neverybody, it's just a matter of time when violence will occur.\n\n\nAren't we able to learn anything from thouthands of years of 'conversion related\nviolence' ? \n\nWhy not let 'the other, more inferiour' people live as they wish and take care \nyour business?. You do assume that they are inferiour (or their beliefs are)\nas long as you want to change their thinking.
Very sensible.\n\n\n\n\nMust you rave so? Fascist x-Soviet Armenian Government engaged in \ndisgusting cowardly massacres of Azeri women and children. I am\nreally sorry if that fact bothers you.\n\n\n\nMore ridicule, I take it? Still not addressing the original points made.\n\n\nThen what seems to be the problem? Did you ever read newspaper at all?\n\n\n"PAINFUL SEARCH .."\n\nTHE GRUESOME extent of February's killings of Azeris by Armenians\nin the town  of Hojali is at last emerging  in Azerbaijan - about\n600 men,  women and  children dead  in the  worst outrage  of the\nfour-year war over Nagorny Karabakh.\n\nThe figure  is drawn  from Azeri investigators,  Hojali officials\nand casualty lists published in the Baku press. Diplomats and aid\nworkers say the death toll is in line with their own estimates.\n\nThe 25  February attack on Hojali  by Armenian forces was  one of\nthe last moves  in their four-year campaign to  take full control\nof Nagorny Karabakh,  the subject of a new  round of negotiations\nin Rome on Monday. The bloodshed was something between a fighting\nretreat and  a massacre, but  investigators say that most  of the\ndead were civilians. The awful  number of people killed was first\nsuppressed by  the fearful  former Communist government  in Baku.\nLater  it  was blurred  by  Armenian  denials and  grief-stricken\nAzerbaijan's wild  and contradictory  allegations of up  to 2,000\ndead.\n\nThe State Prosecuter, Aydin Rasulov,  the cheif investigator of a\n15-man  team  looking  into  what Azerbaijan  calls  the  "Hojali\nDisaster", said  his figure of 600  people dead was a  minimum on\npreliminary  findings.  A similar  estimate  was  given by  Elman\nMemmedov, the mayor of Hojali. An  even higher one was printed in\nthe Baku newspaper  Ordu in May - 479 dead  people named and more\nthan 200 bodies reported unidentified.  This figure of nearly 700\ndead is quoted as official by Leila Yunusova, the new spokeswoman\nof the Azeri Ministry of Defence.\n\nFranCois Zen  Ruffinen, head  of delegation of  the International\nRed Cross  in Baku, said  the Muslim imam  of the nearby  city of\nAgdam had reported a figure of  580 bodies received at his mosque\nfrom  Hojali, most  of  them  civilians. "We  did  not count  the\nbodies. But  the figure seems  reasonable. It is no  fantasy," Mr\nZen Ruffinen said. "We have some idea since we gave the body bags\nand products to wash the dead."\n\nMr  Rasulov endeavours  to give  an unemotional  estimate of  the\nnumber of  dead in the  massacre. "Don't  get worked up.  It will\ntake  several months  to  get a  final  figure," the  43-year-old\nlawyer said at his small office.\n\nMr Rasulov  knows about these  things. It  took him two  years to\nreach  a firm  conclusion that  131  people were  killed and  714\nwounded  when  Soviet  troops  and tanks  crushed  a  nationalist\nuprising in Baku in January 1990.\n\nThose  nationalists, the  Popular  Front, finally  came to  power\nthree weeks  ago and  are applying pressure  to find  out exactly\nwhat  happened when  Hojali, an  Azeri town  which lies  about 70\nmiles from the border with Armenia, fell to the Armenians.\n\nOfficially, 184 people have so  far been certified as dead, being\nthe  number of  people that  could be  medically examined  by the\nrepublic's forensic department. "This  is just a small percentage\nof the dead," said Rafiq Youssifov, the republic's chief forensic\nscientist. "They were the only bodies brought to us. Remember the\nchaos and the fact that we are  Muslims and have to wash and bury\nour dead within 24 hours."\n\nOf these 184 people, 51 were women, and 13 were children under 14\nyears old.  Gunshots killed  151 people,  shrapnel killed  20 and\naxes or  blunt instruments  killed 10.  Exposure in  the highland\nsnows killed the last three.  Thirty-three people showed signs of\ndeliberate mutilation, including ears,  noses, breasts or penises\ncut off and  eyes gouged out, according  to Professor Youssifov's\nreport. Those 184 bodies examined were less than a third of those\nbelieved to have been killed, Mr Rasulov said.\n\nFiles  from  Mr  Rasulov's  investigative  commission  are  still\ndisorganised -  lists of 44  Azeri militiamen are dead  here, six\npolicemen there,  and in handwriting  of a mosque  attendant, the\nnames of  111 corpses brought to  be washed in just  one day. The\nmost heartbreaking account from  850 witnesses interviewed so far\ncomes  from Towfiq  Manafov,  an Azeri  investigator  who took  a\nhelicopter  flight  over  the  escape route  from  Hojali  on  27\nFebruary.\n\n"There were too many bodies of  dead and wounded on the ground to\ncount properly: 470-500  in Hojali, 650-700 people  by the stream\nand the road and 85-100  visible around Nakhchivanik village," Mr\nManafov  wrote in  a  statement countersigned  by the  helicopter\npilot.\n\n"People waved up  to us for help. We saw  three dead children and\none  two-year-old alive  by  one  dead woman.  The  live one  was\npulling at her arm for the mother to get up. We tried to land but\nArmenians started a barrage against  our helicopter and we had to\nreturn."\n\nThere  has been  no consolidation  of  the lists  and figures  in\ncirculation because  of the political  upheavals of the  last few\nmonths and the  fact that nobody knows exactly who  was in Hojali\nat the time - many inhabitants were displaced from other villages\ntaken over by Armenian forces.\n\nTHE INDEPENDENT, London, 12/6/'92\n\n\nHEROES WHO FOUGHT ON AMID THE BODIES\n\nAREF  SADIKOV sat  quietly  in the  shade of  a  cafe-bar on  the\nCaspian Sea  esplanade of Baku and  showed a line of  stitches in\nhis trousers, torn  by an Armenian bullet as he  fled the town of\nHojali just over three months ago, writes Hugh Pope.\n\n"I'm still  wearing the same  clothes, I don't have  any others,"\nthe  51-year-old carpenter  said,  beginning his  account of  the\nHojali disaster. "I was wounded in five places, but I am lucky to\nbe alive."\n\nMr Sadikov and  his wife were short of  food, without electricity\nfor more than a month, and cut off from helicopter flights for 12\ndays. They  sensed the  Armenian noose was tightening  around the\n2,000 to  3,000 people left in  the straggling Azeri town  on the\nedge of Karabakh.\n\n"At about 11pm  a bombardment started such as we  had never heard\nbefore,  eight  or  nine   kinds  of  weapons,  artillery,  heavy\nmachine-guns, the lot," Mr Sadikov said.\n\nSoon neighbours were  pouring down the street  from the direction\nof  the  attack. Some  huddled  in  shelters but  others  started\nfleeing the town,  down a hill, through a stream  and through the\nsnow into a forest on the other side.\n\nTo escape, the  townspeople had to reach the Azeri  town of Agdam\nabout 15  miles away. They  thought they  were going to  make it,\nuntil at  about dawn  they reached a  bottleneck between  the two\nArmenian villages of Nakhchivanik and Saderak.\n\n"None of my group was hurt up to then ... Then we were spotted by\na  car on  the road,  and the  Armenian outposts  started opening\nfire," Mr Sadikov said.\n\nAzeri militiamen fighting their way  out of Hojali rushed forward\nto force  open a  corridor for the  civilians, but  their efforts\nwere mostly  in vain.  Mr Sadikov  said only  10 people  from his\ngroup of  80 made it  through, including his wife  and militiaman\nson.  Seven  of  his  immediate  relations  died,  including  his\n67-year-old elder brother.\n\n"I only had time to reach down  and cover his face with his hat,"\nhe said, pulling his own big  flat Turkish cap over his eyes. "We\nhave never got any of the bodies back."\n\nThe first groups were lucky to have the benefit of covering fire.\nOne hero  of the  evacuation, Alif  Hajief, was  shot dead  as he\nstruggled to change  a magazine while covering  the third group's\ncrossing, Mr Sadikov said.\n\nAnother hero,  Elman Memmedov, the  mayor of Hojali, said  he and\nseveral others  spent the whole day  of 26 February in  the bushy\nhillside, surrounded by  dead bodies as they tried  to keep three\nArmenian armoured personnel carriers at bay.\n\nAs the  survivors staggered the  last mile into Agdam,  there was\nlittle comfort  in a town from  which most of the  population was\nsoon to flee.\n\n"The night  after we reached  the town  there was a  big Armenian\nrocket attack. Some people just  kept going," Mr Sadikov said. "I\nhad to  get to the  hospital for treatment. I  was in a  bad way.\nThey even found a bullet in my sock."\n\nVictims of  war: An  Azeri woman  mourns her  son, killed  in the\nHojali massacre in February  (left).

When the girls fled, \n the soldiers threw empty bottles at them.\n     \n On Saturday, a group of soldiers opened their shirts and pulled down their\n pants when they saw girls from Al-Khansaa walking home from school. Parents \n are considering keeping their daughters home from the all-girls school.\n     \n The same day, soldiers harassed two passing schoolgirls after a youth\n escaped from them at a boys' secondary school. Deputy Principal Srur \n Abu-Jamea said they shouted abusive language at the girls, backed them \n against a wall, and put their arms around them.\n \n When teacher Hamdan Abu-Hajras intervened the soldiers kicked him and beat\n him with the butts of their rifles.\n \n On Tuesday, troops stopped a car driven by Abdel Azzim Qdieh, a practising\n Moslem, and demanded he kiss his female passenger. Qdieh refused, the \n soldiers hit him and the 18-year-old passenger kissed him to stop the \n beating.\n \n On Friday, soldiers entered the home of Zamno Abu-Ealyan, 60, blindfolded\n him and his wife, put a music tape on a recorder and demanded they dance. As\n the elderly couple danced, the soldiers slipped away.

The closure cut off Arabs in the West Bank\n and Gaza Strip from Jerusalem, their economic, spiritual and cultural centre.\n \n    Father Nicola Akel said Christians did not want to suffer the humiliation\n of requesting permits to reach holy sites.\n \n     Makhlouf said the closure was discriminatory, allowing Jews free movement\n to take part in recent Passover celebrations while restricting Christian\n celebrations.\n \n     ``Yesterday, we saw the Jews celebrate Passover without any interruption.\n But we cannot reach our holiest sites,'' he said.\n \n     An Israeli officer interrupted Makhlouf's speech, demanding to see his\n identity card before ordering the crowd to leave.\n \n                   ...................\n \n              \n \n If you are as revolted at this as I am, drop Israel's best friend email and \n let him know what you think.\n \n \n           75300.3115@compuserve.com (via CompuServe)\n           clintonpz@aol.com         (via America Online)\n           clinton-hq@campaign92.org (via MCI Mail)\n \n \n Tell 'em ARF sent ya.\n \n                  ..................................\n \n If you are tired of "learning" about American foreign policy from what is \n effectively, Israeli controlled media, I highly recommend checking out the \n Washington Report.

Thank you, Brad/Ali, for warning us about the dangers of propaganda.\nIt's funny, though, coming from you.\n\n\nWho is it that executes these "pin-point attacks" on Israelis?  The\nguys in the white hats or the ones in the black hats?  Neither?  You\nmean that they are just civilians, farmers, teachers, school children?\nWell, maybe they ARE terrorists, after all?  And maybe that\n"propaganda" was correct, too?  Hmm?
From: Center for Policy Research <cpr>\nSubject: Unconventional peace proposal\n\n\nA unconventional proposal for peace in the Middle-East.\n---------------------------------------------------------- by\n			  Elias Davidsson\n\nThe following proposal is based on the following assumptions:\n\n1.      Fundamental human rights, such as the right to life, to\neducation, to establish a family and have children, to human\ndignity, the right to free movement, to free expression, etc. are\nmore important to human existence that the rights of states.\n\n2.      In the event of a conflict between basic human rights and\nrights of collectivities, basic human rights should prevail.\n\n3.      Between the collectivities defining themselves as\nJewish-Israeli and Palestinian-Arab, however labelled, an\nunresolved conflict exists.\n\n4.      This conflict has caused great sufferings for millions of\npeople. It moreover poisons relations between communities, peoples\nand nations.\n\n5.      Each year, the United States expends billions of dollars\nin economic and military aid to the conflicting parties.\n\n6.      Attempts to solve the Israeli-Arab conflict by traditional\npolitical means have failed.\n\n7.      As long as the conflict is perceived as that between two\ndistinct ethnical/religious communities/peoples which claim the\nland, there is no just nor peaceful solution possible.\n\n8.      Love between human beings can be capitalized for the sake\nof peace and justice. When people love, they share.\n\nHaving stated my assumptions, I will now state my proposal.\n\n1.      A Fund should be established which would disburse grants\nfor each child born to a couple where one partner is Israeli-Jew\nand the other Palestinian-Arab.\n\n2.      To be entitled for a grant, a couple will have to prove\nthat one of the partners possesses or is entitled to Israeli\ncitizenship under the Law of Return and the other partner,\nalthough born in areas under current Isreali control, is not\nentitled to such citizenship under the Law of Return.\n\n3.      For the first child, the grant will amount to $18.000. For\nthe second the third child, $12.000 for each child. For each\nsubsequent child, the grant will amount to $6.000 for each child.\n\n\n4.      The Fund would be financed by a variety of sources which\nhave shown interest in promoting a peaceful solution to the\nIsraeli-Arab conflict, including the U.S. Government, Jewish and\nChristian organizations in the U.S.  and a great number of\ngovernments and international organizations.\n\n5.      The emergence of a considerable number of 'mixed'\nmarriages in Israel/Palestine, all of whom would have relatives on\n'both sides' of the divide, would make the conflict lose its\nethnical and unsoluble core and strengthen the emergence of a\ntruly civil society. The existence of a strong 'mixed' stock of\npeople would also help the integration of Israeli society into the\nMiddle-East in a graceful manner.\n\nObjections to this proposal will certainly be voiced. I will\nattempt to identify some of these:\n\n1.      The idea of providing financial incentives to selected\nforms of partnership and marriage, is not conventional. However,\nit is based on the concept of affirmative action, which is\nrecognized as a legitimate form of public policy to reverse the\nperverse effects of segregation and discrimination. International\nlaw clearly permits affirmative action when it is aimed at\nreducing racial discrimination and segregation.\n\n2.      It may be objected that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict\nis not primarily a religious or ethnical conflict, but that it is\na conflict between a colonialist settler society and an indigenous\ncolonized society that can only regain its freedom by armed\nstruggle. This objection is based on the assumption that the\n'enemy' is not Zionism as ideology and practice, but\nIsraeli-Jewish society and its members which will have to be\ndefeated. This objection has no merit because it does not fulfill\nthe first two assumptions concerning the primacy of fundamental\nhuman rights over collective rights (see above)\n\n3.      Fundamentalist Jews would certainly object to the use of\nfinancial incentives to encourage 'mixed marriages'. From their\npoint of view, the continued existence of a specific Jewish People\noverrides any other consideration, be it human love, peace of\nhuman rights.  The President of the World Jewish Congress, Edgar\nBronfman, reflected this view a few years ago in an interview he\ngave to Der Spiegel, a German magazine. He called the increasing\nassimilation of Jews in the world a <calamity>, comparable in its\neffects only with the Holocaust. This objection has no merit\neither because it does not fulfill the first two assumptions (see\nabove)\n\n4.      It may objected that only a few people in\nIsrael/Palestine, would request such grants and that it would thus\nnot serve its purpose. To this objection one might respond that\nalthough it is not possible to determine with certainty the effect\nof such a proposal, the existence of such a Fund would help mixed\ncouples to resist the pressure of their respective societies and\nencourage young couples to reject fundamentalist and racist\nattitudes.\n\n5.      It may objected that such a Fund would need great sums to\nbring about substantial demographic changes. This objection has\nmerits. However, it must be remembered that huge sums, more than\n$3 billion, are expended each year by the United States government\nand by U.S. organizations to maintain an elusive peace in the\nMiddle-East through armaments. A mere fraction of these sums would\nsuffice to launch the above proposal and create a more favorable\nclimate towards the existence of 'mixed' marriages in\nIsrael/Palestine, thus encouraging the emergence of a\nnon-segregated society in that worn-torn land.\n\nI would be thankful for critical comments to the above proposal as\nwell for any dissemination of this proposal for meaningful\ndiscussion and enrichment.
I will again *repeat* my statement: 1) I *do not* condone these \n*indiscriminate* Israeli acts (nor have I *ever*, 2) If the villagers do not know who these "guerillas" are (which you stated earlier), how do you expect the\nIsraelis to know? It is **very** difficult to "identify" who they are (this\n*is why* the "guerillas" prefer to lose themselves in the general population \nby dressing the same, acting the same, etc.).\nI agree; but, because Lebanon was either unwilling or unable to stop these\nattacks from its territory should Israel simply sit quietly and accept its\nsituation? Israel asked the Lebanese government over and over to control\nthis "third party state" within Lebanese territory and the attacks kept\noccuring. At **what point** does Israel (or ANY state) have the right to do\nsomething ITSELF to stop such attacks? Never?\nIt is also the responsibility of *any* state to NOT ALLOW *any* outside\nparty to use its territory for attacks on a neighboring state. If 1) Angola\nhad the power, and 2) South Africa refused (or couldn't) stop anti-Angolan\nguerillas based on SA soil from attacking Angola, and 3) South Africa\nrefused to have UN troops stationed on its territory between it and Angola,\nwould Angola be justified in entering SA? If not, are you saying that\nAngola HAD to accept the situation, do NOTHING and absorb the attacks?\nI refered above *at all times* to the Palestinian attacks on Israel from\nLebanese soil, NOT to Lebanese attacks on Israel. \n\nOne hopes that a Lebanese government will be strong enough to patrol its \nborder but there is NO reason to believe it will be any stronger. WHAT HAS \nCHANGED is that the PLO was largely *driven out* of Lebanon (not by the \nLebanese, not by Syria) and THAT is by far the most important making it \nEASIER to control future Palestinian attacks from Lebanese soil. That\n**change** was brought about by Israeli action; the PLO would *never*\nhave been ejected by Lebanese, Arab state or UN actions. \nI fully recognize that the Lebanese do NOT WANT to be "used" by EITHER side,\nand have been (and continue to be). But the most fundamental issue is that\nif a state cannot control its borders and make REAL efforts to do so, it\nshould expect others to do it for them. Hopefully that "other" will be\nthe UN but it is (as we see in its cowardice regarding Bosnia) weak.
First this man promotes the dissolution of the Jews through an\nintermarriage process, and then says that it will be just a bunch\nof 'fundamentalist' Jews who will object.  This clown even called\nfor 'buying' the dissolution of the Jewish people.\n\n   Does this idiot mean to suggest that any Jew who objects to an\nimibicilic notion like this is fundamentalist?  Or does he simply\nmean to insult the orthodox by using the word 'fundamentalist?'\n\n   I am not orthodox.  I am not fundamentalist.  I would desire a\ngenuine peace in the region more than this pinhead  Davidsson can\never understand.  But when he shows his willingness to dismiss an\nentire culture, he proves that the only thing more brain-boggling\nthan his stupidity is his willingness to display his stupidity in \nthis newsgroup.
[stuff deleted]\n\nSmart indeed.  If what you're saying is true, Greeks who visit are happy,\nthe Turkish merchants are happy; who is harmed?  No one.  So not only was\nit a smart move, it was also a good move for it adds to the happiness of\n200.000 Greeks per week and however many Turkish merchants they interact with.\nOne simple move in the paperwork arena -> lotsa happy people of both \nnationalities.  Just and observation.\n\ncheers,\n\nBM
It is called 'The Justice'. We also demand that the x-Soviet Armenian \nGovernment admit its responsibility for the Turkish and Kurdish \nGenocide, render reparations to the Muslim people, and return the \nland to its rightful owners. The recognition of the Genocide has \nbecome an issue which cannot be delayed further, and it is imperative \nthat artificial obstacles created for political manipulations be removed.\n\n\nAre you the 'truelove' or 'falselove' of 'Arromdian' of the ASALA/SDPA/ARF\nTerrorism and Revisionism Triangle? \n\n"If Turks had behaved like Christians to use force to convert to Islam the\nnations which they brought under their power, to which no one could have\nopposed, today there would be no Eastern problem. But Turks did not do so. \nThey obeyed the word of the Koran to permit everybody "to worship in their own\nway" centuries before Frederick the Great pronounced his famous dictum. Thus,\nin an age when the Christian Europe itself shed Christian blood and when \npeople in Europe enjoyed inflicting inhuman tortures upon those whose beliefs\ndiffered from theirs, the Ottoman Empire became the sole country where the\ninquisition did not exist, where deaths at the stake were unheard of and \nwhere accusations of witchcraft were not made. And the barbarian (!) Turkey\nwas the only country where the Jews persecuted and chased away everywhere\nby the Christians, could find asylum. These facts demonstrate that Muslim\ncountries provided spiritually far better living conditions than Christian\ncountries."[1]\n\n"The Turks, who are a conquering nation, did not Turkify the nations that came\nunder their rule; instead, they respected their religions and traditions. It\nwas a stroke of luck for Romania to live under Turkish rule instead of\nRussian or Austrian rule. Because otherwise there would not have been a\nRomanian nation today" (Popescu Ciocanel).\n\n"Turks rule over people under their administration only externally, without\ninterfering with their internal structures. On account of this, the autonomy\nof minorities in Turkey is better and more complete than any in the most\nadvanced European countries."[2]\n\n"...human beings hate each other on account of religious differences. This flaw\nis older than Islam and Christianity. But there has never been any examples\nof this adjuration in Turkey because Turks never oppress anybody on account\nof his religion. If enmity on the basis of religion had been such a case of\nsimple contempt among us too, or if it did not keep translating itself into\naction, many nations in our Europe would probably have considered themselves\nhappy!" (A. de Mortraye).[3]\n\n"Turkey never became a scene for religious terror or for the cruelty of the\ninquisition. On the contrary, it served as an asylum for the unfortunate\nvictims of Christian fanaticism. If you look into history, you will see that\nin the fifteenth century thousands of Jews who were expelled from Spain and\nPortugal found such a good asylum in Turkey that their descendants have been\nliving there very calmly all through these approximately three hundred years,\nand are only forced to defend themselves in some countries against the\ncruelty of Christians, especially that of the Orthodoxes. No Jew is able to\nappear in public during Easter celebrations in Athens, even today. In Turkey,\nhowever, if the Israelites are insulted by the Greek and Armenian communities,\nlocal courts immediately take them under their protection."\n\n"In that vast and calm country of the sultan, all religions and nations are\nliving together peacefully. Although the mosque is superior to the church and\nthe synagogue, it does not replace them. Because of this, the Catholic sect is\nmore free in Istanbul and Smyrna compared with Paris and Lyon. In addition \nto the fact that no law in Turkey prohibits the open-air ceremonies of this \nsect, neither does any law imprison its cross in the church. While the\ndead are being taken to the graves, a long line of priests bear processional\ncandles and chant Catholic hymns. When all the priests in all the churches in\nthe Galata and Beyoglu districts go into the streets and form clerical\nprocessions during the Eucharist celebrations, chanting hymns and bearing\ntheir crosses and religious banners, a detachment of soldiers escorts them\nwhich forces even the Turks to stand in respect around the group of \npriests." (A. Ubicini).[4]\n\n[1]  Ah. Djevat, "Yabancilara Gore Eski Turkler," 3rd ed. (Istanbul, 1978),\n     pp. 70-71.\n[2]  Ibid., p.91.\n[3]  Ibid., pp. 214-215.\n[4]  Ibid., pp. 215-216.\n\nSerdar Argic

[...]\nhenrik]  Country. Turks and Azeris consistantly WANT to drag ARMENIA into the\nhenrik]  KARABAKH conflict with Azerbaijan. \n\nBM] Gimme a break.  CAPITAL letters, or NOT, the above is pure nonsense.  It\nBM] seems to me that short sighted Armenians are escalating the hostilities\n			^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nhenrik]	Again, Armenians in KARABAKH are SIMPLY defending themselves. What do\nhenrik]	want them to do. Lay down their ARMS and let Azeris walk all over them.\n\nNews reports I've seen say otherwise both location and motives wise.  \nCAPS don't change facts.\n\nBM] while hoping that Turkey will stay out.  Stop and think for a moment,\nBM] will you?  Armenia doesn't need anyone to drag her into the conflict, it\nBM] is a part of it.  \n\nhenrik]   Armenians KNEW from the begining that TURKS were FULLY engaged \nhenrik]   training AZERIS militarily to fight against  KARABAKHI-Armenians.\n\nSo?  Should I, at this point break into caps and start talking about \nDEFENSE etc.?  I don't know how 'fully engaged' Turkey is/was though.\n\nhenrik] The KARABAKHI-ARMENIANS who have lived in their HOMELAND for 3000 \nhenrik] years (CUT OFF FROM ARMENIA and GIVEN TO AZERIS BY STALIN) are the \nhenrik] ones DIRECTLY involved in the CONFLICT. They are defending \nhenrik] themselves against AZERI AGGRESSION. \n\nBM] Huh?  You didn't expect Azeri's to be friendly to forces fighting with them\nBM]  within their borders?  \n\nhenrik] Well, history is SAD. Remember, those are relocated Azeris into \nhenrik] the Armenian LAND of KARABAKH by the STALIN regime.\n\nSo I hear.  This justifies bloodshed N years after the fact?\n\nhenrik] At last, I hope that the U.S. insists that Turkey stay out of the \nhenrik] KARABAKH crisis so that the repeat of the CYPRUS invasion WILL NEVER \nhenrik] OCCUR again.\n\nBM] You're not playing with a full deck, are you?  Where would Turkey invade?\n\nhenrik] It is not up to me to speculate but I am sure Turkey would have stepped\nhenrik] into Armenia if SHE could.\n\nWhy would Turkey do that?  Do you not realize that this is a local clash\nthat Turkey never wished to see happen?  Turkey has other plans for region,\nlike economic revival, co-operation etc.  Good stuff in other words,  I'd\nbe happy to bicker with Armenians over trade barriers and such on USENET\nrather than 'who killed whom in what way' which I detest doing and wouldn't \ndo.  \n\nBM] Are you throwing the Cyprus buzzword around with s.c.g. in the header\nBM] in hopes that the Greek netters will jump the gun?  \n\nhenrik]	   Absolutely NOT ! I am merely trying to emphasize that in many\nhenrik]	   cases, HISTORY repeats itself. \n\nEven if one buys into your implicit premise, the sane thing to do would\nbe to try not to provoke Turkey as was done in '74.  If there'd been\na democratic government instead of a bunch of idiots in Athens at the\ntime, everybody would have stayed home with their families.  [I have no\nwish to go into the Cyprus quarrel, but I suspect what I've said is not\nonly accurate but also palatable to all parties involved]\n\nBM] Yes indeed Turkey has the military prowess to intervene, what she wishes \nBM] she had, however, is the diplomatic power to stop the hostilities and bring\nBM] the parties to the negotiating table.  That's hard to do when Armenians \nBM] are attacking Azeri towns.\n\nhenrik]	   So, let me understand in plain WORDS what you are saying; Turkey\nhenrik]	   wants a PEACEFUL END to this CONFLICT. NOT !!\n\nSo what do you think we want?  War, death and destruction?  \n\nhenrik]	   I will believe it when I see it.\n\nNo, if you allow yourself to believe it you just might see it.\n\nhenrik]  Now, as far as attacking, what do you do when you see a GUN pointing\nhenrik]to your HEAD ? Do you sit there and WATCH or DEFEND yoursef(fat chance)?\n	\nThis kind of childish rhetoric doesn't help anthing.\n\nhenrik]  Do you remember what Azeris did to the Armenians in BAKU ? All the\nhenrik]  BARBERIAN ACTS especially against MOTHERS and their CHILDREN. I mean\nhenrik]  BURNING people ALIVE !\n\nNow, some Azeri will come out and give a description of similar stuff\nperpetrated by Armenians.  One should re-hash stuff like this often to\nkeep the hatred alive, right?\n\nBM] Armenian leaders are lacking the statesmanship to recognize the \nBM]futility of armed conflict and convince their nation that a compromise that \nBM] leads to stability is much better than a military faits accomplis that's \nBM] going to cause incessant skirmishes.  \n\nhenrik]	   Armenians in KARABAKH want PEACE and their own republic. They are \nhenrik]	   NOT asking much. They simply want to get back what was TAKEN AWAY \nhenrik]	   from them and GIVEN to AZERIS by STALIN. \n\nWell they obviously aren't getting anywhere with their current methods\nof asking (not very peaceful I'd say).\n\nBM] Think of 10 or 20 years down the line -- both of the newly independent \nBM] countries need to develop economically and neither one is going to wipe \nBM] the other out.   These people will be neighbors, would it not be better \nBM] to keep the bad blood between them minimal?\n\nhenrik]	   Don't get me WRONG. I also want PEACEFUL solution to the\nhenrik]	   conflict. But until Azeris realize that, the Armenians in\nhenrik]	   KARABAKH will defend themselves against aggresion.\n\nI don't know if you want a solution or just want to exchange slogans.\nPeace isn't what's happening right now, furthermore what's happening\nright now isn't condusive to peace.  You can spend days and nights \nraving about how 'right' the Armenian position is and I'm sure\nthere'll be others who'd be happy to talk to you by arguing the other\nside.  If entrenched positions lead to war, and if people want peace\nthan they should sit down and talk about a compromise.  Armenia isn't\nstrong enough to exercise the 'we think we're right, and we have the \nbombs, so we'll do whatever we want, so there...' style of foreign \nrelations.  Yes you can type Stalin in caps, and give one sided\natrocity stories etc. but for peace you need to be willing to talk to \nthe other side.  You personally can choose not to do that of course,\nthis being just USENET.  The people in power shouldn't be so childish.\n\n\nBM] If you belong to the Armenian diaspora, keep in mind that what strikes\nBM] your fancy on the map is costing the local Armenians dearly in terms of \nBM] their blood and future. \n\nhenrik]	   Again, you are taking different TURNS. Armenia HAS no intension\nhenrik]	   to GRAB any LAND from Azerbaijan. The Armenians in KARABAKH\nhenrik]	   are simply defending themselves UNTIL a solution is SET.\n\nAzeri's would disagree with you on this, and the maps I've seen support\nwhat they'd be saying.  It doesn't seem likely that a solution will be\nreached in this manner.  \n\nBM] It's easy to be comfortable abroad and propagandize \nBM] craziness to have your feelings about Turks tickled.  The Armenians\nBM] in Armenia and N-K will be there, with the same people you seem to hate \nBM] as their neighbors, for maybe 3000 years more.  The sooner there's peace in\nBM] the region the better it is for them and everyone else.  I'd push for\nBM] compromise if I were you instead of hitting the caps-lock and spreading\nBM] inflammatory half-truths.\n\nhenrik]   It is NOT up to me to decide the PEACE initiative. I am absolutely\nhenrik]   for it. \n\nIt didn't look it when I read your posting.  It would seem to me \nthat if you can spew mis-information about a boogey-man, you can also\ntalk about how one might avoid the nastiness.  Fair?\n\nhenrik] But, in the meantime, if you do not take care of yourself,\nhenrik] you will be WIPED out. Such as the case in the era of 1915-20 of\nhenrik] The Armenian Massacres.\n\nYou don't realize I can say the same thing about 'The Turkish Massacres.'\nYes, boys and girls, let's always talk about how bad and nasty things were.\nLet's do that so we're overwhelmed by anger, and let's do that so our\nkids will also be hateful.  Sounds crazy doesn't it?  Don't do it then.
So, it's okay to use civilians for cover if you're attacking soldiers\nin your country.  (Of course, many of those attacking claim that they\naren't Lebanese, so it's not their country.)\n\nGot it.  I think.  Hmm.  This is confusing.\n\nCould you perhaps repeat your rules explaining exactly when it is\npermissible to use civilians as shields?  Also please explain under\nwhat conditions it is permissible for soldiers to defend themselves.\nAlso please explain the particular rules that make it okay for\nterrorists to launch missiles from Lebanon against Israeli civilians,\nbut not okay for the Israelis to try to defend themselves against\nthose missiles.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nI've heard many Turks say this and it surpises me that they don't read about\nit.Remember the Treaty of Sevres-as a consequence of being in the Axis powers\nin WWI.The Turks UNDER INTERNATIONAL LAW were supposed to look after their\nminorities ie. Greeks,Armenians,Kurds(I must say Turk-Kurd relations are \nimproving slightly with time) and not pose a threat to Turkey's neighbours.\nThe Turks blatantly rejected this treaty(the Germans grudgingly accepted \nVersailles which was a million times worse for the health and pride of the \nGerman people).The Greeks who had an army there,were there with BRITISH\nand FRENCH backing to enforce Sevres.\n    In possibly the first example of appeasement the Young Turk government\nmanaged screwed the Treaty of Laussane out of the weak allies,this was after \nthe Greek forces were were destroyed at Smyrna.When this occurred incidently,\nFRENCH warships were in the harbour and many Greeks trying escape swam to the \nFRENCH warships and climbed aboard only to get their arms cut off by the FRENCH\nas they clawed they're way up the sides of the ships.\nLibertae,egalitae,fraternatae.

I respect anybody\n  who dissagrees with me as long as he respects me and discusses in a\n  civilized manner. I would never say that anybody that critizises Israel\n  and/or its politics is an antisemite, except he uses antisemitic\n  vocabulary/terminology/demagogy. Israel is not a perfect country and\n  its politicians also commits errors, even some of them are corrupt\n  (like politicians in any other country), but they carry a huge burden:\n  to care for the safety of ALL its citizens, and that is really not an\n  easy task in a country that is surrounded by enemies who only expect\n  that Israel commits the ONE BIG ERROR and wipe the country (and its\n  Jewish citizens plus the so-called collaborators, arabs that wanted to\n  live in peace with their Jewish neighbours) of the map. As I said,\n  Israel is not a perfect country, but it is the ONLY democracy in the\n  whole Middle-East and the only country in the world where Jews from\n  everywhere can have a refuge in case of persecutions in the countries\n  they are living.\n  Our long history has taught us that we cannot rely on non-Jewish\n  nations and its governments: as soon as there are more or les big\n  social-economical-political problems in any country, the first ones\n  that pay for the broken glasses are the Jews, and later the other\n  minorities of the country.\n  \n                    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ \n\n  This is really outrageous: 6.000.000 murdered Jews, besides the\n  thousands  who survived the Shoa in some way or another, and the rest\n  of the living ones mourning for all of them ! I don't know what you\n  call a "Civil Libertarian" (never heard about them) but I know only\n  one thing: if all of them think like you do it, then "Civil Libertarians"\n  is a new denomination for Antisemites.

Steve,\n\nIf the Israelis are stupid enough to "allow" a second "Palestinian"\nstate (the first one is Jordon), then you will probably get your\nwish - and the Israelis would get what's coming to them.\n\nHowever, if the "Palestinians" were to somehow demonstrate that \nthey could govern themselves AND live in peace with their \nJewish neighbors, then they would have to give up the idea of\nJerusalem as a part of their state - and you would be disappointed.\n\n\n\nYashir Koach to this.
WASHINGTON (UPI) -- A senior State Department official on Tuesday\nruled out any softening of U.S. attitudes toward Iraq but said relations\nwith Iran's Islamic regime could improve substantially if that\ngovernment disassociates itself from international terrorism.\n	``Despite the name-calling and the harsh rhetoric from across the\nGulf, despite all this, we do not take a position of permanent hostility\ntowards the Islamic Republic of Iran,'' David Mack, deputy assistant\nsecretary for Near Eastern Affairs, said.\n	The primary U.S. objection is ``Iran's international behaviour''\nwhich includes ``extending support of violence'' to disrupt the Arab\nIsraeli peace process and its rapid build-up of dangerous weapons.\n	Mack said ``Iran could contribute to regional stability and peace but\nfirst it is to end the behaviour which threatens this area.''\n	Mack spoke at the U.S.-GCC business conference aimed at promoting\nGulf-American trade. He said the ``Middle East will be an item very high\non the agenda of the U.S. administration.''\n	The importance of the Gulf is underlined by Secretary of State Warren\nChristoper's visit last year to Saudi Arabia and Kuwait before anywhere\nelse in the world, Mack said. He added that the U.S. has no long-term\nplan to station troops in the Gulf.\n	Mack also insisted that the Clinton administration will continue to\npressure Iraq to ``comply with all the U.N. Security resolutions.''\n	``As long as Iraq is ruled by Saddam Hussein we do not expect\ncompliance,'' Mack told delegates.

As someone who reads Israeli newpapaers every day, I can state\nwith absolute certainty, that anybody who relies on western media\nto get a picture of what is happening in Israel is not getting an\naccurate picture.

04/19/1993 0000  Lezghis Astir\n\nBy NEJLA SAMMAKIA\n Associated Press Writer\n   \nGUSSAR, Azerbaijan (AP) -- The 600,000 Lezghis of Azerbaijan and Russia have\nbegun clamoring for their own state, threatening turmoil in a tranquil corner \nof the Caucasus.\n\nThe region has escaped the ethnic warfare of neighboring Nagorno-Karabakh,\nAbkhazia and Ossetia, but Lezhgis could become the next minority in the former\nSoviet Union to fight for independence.\n\nLezghis, who are Muslim descendents of nomadic shepherds, are angry about the\nconscription of their young men to fight in Azerbaijan's 5-year-old undeclared\nwar with Armenia.\n\nThey also want to unite the Lezghi regions of Azerbaijan and Russia, which\nwere effectively one until the breakup of the Soviet Union created national\nborders that had been only lines on a map.\n\nA rally of more than 3,000 Lezghis in March to protest conscription and\ndemand a separate "Lezghistan" alarmed the Azerbaijani government.\n\nOfficials in Baku, the capital, deny rumors that police shot six\ndemonstrators to death. But the government announced strict security measures\nand began cooperating with Russian authorities to control the movement of\nLezhgis living across the border in the Dagestan region of Russia.\n\nVisitors to Gussar, the center of Lezhgi life, found the town quiet soon\nafter the protest. Children played outdoors in the crisp mountain air.\n\nAt the Sunday bazaar, men in heavy coats and dark fur hats gathered to\ndiscuss grievances ranging from high customs duties at the Russian border to a\nwar they say is not theirs.\n\n"I have been drafted, but I won't go," said Shamil Kadimov, gold teeth\nglinting in the sun. "Why must I fight a war for the Azerbaijanis? I have\nnothing to do with Armenia."\n\nMore than 3,000 people have died in the war, which centers on the disputed\nterritory of Nagorno-Karabakh, about 150 miles to the southeast.\n\nMalik Kerimov, an official in the mayor's office, said only 11 of 300 locals\ndrafted in 1992 had served.\n\n"The police don't force people to go," he said. "They are afraid of an\nuprising that could be backed by Lezghis in Dagestan."\n\nAll the men agreed that police had not fired at the demonstrators, but\ndisagreed on how the protest came about.\n\nSome said it occurred spontaneously when rumors spread that Azerbaijan was\nabout to draft 1,500 men from the Gussar region, where 75,000 Lezghis live.\n\nOthers said the rally was ordered by Gen. Muhieddin Kahramanov, leader of the\nLezhgi underground separatist movement, Sadval, based in Dagestan.\n\n"We organized the demonstration when families came to us distraught about\ndraft orders," said Kerim Babayev, a mathematics teacher who belongs to Sadval.\n\n"We hope to reunite peacefully, by approaching everyone -- the Azerbaijanis, \nthe Russians."\n\nIn the early 18th century, the Lezhgis formed two khanates, or sovereignties,\nin what are now Azerbaijan and Dagestan. They roamed freely with their sheep\nover the green hills and mountains between the two khanates.\n\nBy 1812, the Lezghi areas were joined to czarist Russia. After 1917, they\ncame under Soviet rule. With the disintegration of the Soviet Union, the \n600,000 Lezghis were faced for the first time with strict borders.\n\nAbout half remained in Dagestan and half in newly independent Azerbaijan.\n\n"We have to pay customs on all this, on cars, on wine," complained Mais\nTalibov, a small trader. His goods, laid out on the ground at the bazaar,\nincluded brandy, stomach medication and plastic shoes from Dagestan.\n\n"We want our own country," he said. "We want to be able to move about easily.\nBut Baku won't listen to us."\n\nPhysically, it is hard for outsiders to distinguish Lezhgis from other\nAzerbaijanis. In many villages, they live side by side, working at the same \njobs and intermarrying to some degree.\n\nBut the Lezhgis have a distinctive language, a mixture of Arabic, Turkish and\nPersian with strong guttural vowels.\n\nAzerbaijan officially supports the cultural preservation of its 10 largest\nethnic minorities. The Lezghis have weekly newspapers and some elementary \nschool classes in their language.\n\nAutonomy is a different question. If the Lezghis succeeded in separating from\nAzerbaijan, they would set a precedent for other minorities, such as the \nTalish in the south, the Tats in the nearby mountains and the Avars of eastern\nAzerbaijan.
Tell me Tim, what are these guerillas doing wrong? Assuming that they are using\ncivilians for cover, are they not killing SOLDIERS in THEIR country? If the\nbuffer zone is to prevent attacks on Israel, is it not working? Why is it \nfurther neccessary for Israeli guns to pound Lebanese villages? Why not just\nkill those who try to infiltrate the buffer zone? You see, there is more to\nthe shelling of the villages.... it is called RETALIATION... "GETTING BACK"\n..."GETTING EVEN". It doesn't make sense to shell the villages. The least\nit shows is a reckless disregard by the Israeli government for the lives of\ncivilians.\n\n\n\n\nIf Israel is not willing to accept the "word" of others then, IMHO, it has\nno business wasting others' time coming to the peace talks. \n\n\nNo, I am not Basil. I think Basil is a very intelligent person and I\nrespect what he writes. Basil is a person that I would gladly call\na friend. He is, however, not me. Nor am I Lebanese, as some seem to\nsuspect.\n \n\nTim, you are ignoring the fact that the Palestinians in Lebanon have been\ndisarmed. Hezbollah remains the only independent militia. Hezbollah does\nnot attack Israel except at a few times such as when the IDF burned up\nSheikh Mosavi, his wife, and young son. Of course, if Israel would withdraw\nfrom Lebanon and stop assassinating people and shelling villages they wouldn't\nmake the Lebanese so mad as to do that. Furthermore, with Hezbollah \nsubsequently disarmed, it would not be possible.\n\n\nTim, when is the last time that you recall any trouble on the Syrian border?\nNot lately, eh?\n\nIsrael knows very well that the Syrians are able to restrain ALL who would use\nterritory under their control to attack Israel. While Lebanon would be better\noff with Syria and Israel out of its borders, the presence of Syrian troops\nin Lebanon has meant a sharp decrease in attacks on Israeli territory (not on\nIsraeli troops in Lebanon, however. Please note the distinction) in the\npast two years.\n\n\nI disagree, Basil has always seemed to me to be a cool-headed person, slow\nto anger (certainly more so than I). What is most important is that he is an \nactual witness to things from the other end of the Israeli guns. If only the \nIsraeli government would remember what it was like when the roles were \nreversed perhaps they would moderate their "retaliation".
If the attack was justified or not is at least debatable. But this is not the\nissue. The issue is that you were cheering DEATH. Read again your original\narticle. You find Israeli government responsible for those dead soldiers, that's\na reasonable (debatable) point, but feel satisfaction from dead bodies is \nNOT REASONABLE  by any standards. No matter how you try to justify it.\nI may understand your frustration against israeli occupation in S Lebanon.\nBut no matter what you say, I can not understand your satisfaction for dead\nbodies.\n\nI have a question for you. Let's assume a bosnian village, inhabited by serbs\nuntill a few (10-20) years ago, and later taken over by bosnian muslims (the means\nare not very peaceful). Now, do you enjoy serbs coming and killing all (armed)\nbosnian muslims ? I would not enjoy, but I would not enjoy ANY dead bodies - \nisraelis, lebanese or bosnians.

It seems that President Clinton can recognize Jerusalem as Israels capitol\nwhile still keeping his diplomatic rear door open by stating that the Parties\nconcerned should decide the city's final status.

Ten Questions about arab countries\n----------------------------------\n\nI would be thankful if any of you who live in arab countries could\nhelp to provide accurate answers to the following specific questions.\nThese are indeed provocative questions but they are asked time and\nagain by people around me.\n\n1.      Is it true that many arab countries don't recognize\nIsraeli nationality ?  That people with Israeli stamps on their\npassports can't enter arabic countries?\n\n2.      Is it true that arabic countries such as Jordan and Syria\nhave undefined borders and that arab governments from 1948 until today\nhave refused to state where the ultimate borders of their states\nshould be?\n\n3.      Is it true that arab countires refused to sign the Chemical\nweapon convention treaty in Paris in 1993?\n\n4.      Is it true that in arab prisons there are a number of\nindividuals which were tried in secret and for which their\nidentities, the date of their trial and their imprisonment are\nstate secrets ?\n\n4a.	Is it true that some arab countries, like Syria, harbor Nazi\nwar criminals, and refuse to extradite them?\n\n4b.	Is it true that some arab countries, like Saudi Arabia,\nprohibit women from driving cars?\n\n5.      Is it true that Jews who reside in the Muslim\ncountries are subject to different laws than Muslims?\n\n6.      Is it true that arab countries confiscated the property of\nentire Jewish communites forced to flee by anti-Jewish riots?\n\n7.      Is it true that Israel's Prime Minister, Y. Rabin, signed\na chemical weapons treaty that no arab nation was willing to sign?\n\n8.      Is it true that Syrian Jews are required to leave a $10,000\ndeposit before leaving the country, and are no longer allowed to\nemmigrate, despite promises made by Hafez Assad to George Bush?\n\n9.	 Is it true that Jews in Muslim lands are required to pay a\nspecial tax, for being Jews?\n\n10.     Is it true that Intercontinental Hotel in Jerusalem was built\non a Jewish cemetary, with roads being paved over grave sites, and\ngravestones being used in Jordanian latrines?\n\n11.	Is it really cheesy and inappropriate to post lists of biased\nleading questions?\n\n11a.	Is it less appropriate if information implied in Mr.\nDavidsson's questions is highly misleading?\n\nAdam\n\nAdam Shostack 				       adam@das.harvard.edu
Just kidding
Proven?  Maybe not.  But it can certainly be verified beyond a reasonable doubt.  This\nstatement and statements like it are a matter of public record.  Before the Six Day War (1967)\nI think Nasser and some other Arab leaders were broadcasting these statements on\nArab radio.  You might want to check out some old newspapers Ahmed.\n\n\n\nI think if you take a look at the Hamas covenant (written in 1988) you might get a \ndifferent impression.  I have the convenant in the original arabic with a translation\nthat I've verified with Arabic speakers.  The document is rife with calls to kill jews\nand spread Islam and so forth.
I think you are confusing "tautological" with "false and misleading."
Well i'm not sure about the story nad it did seem biased. What\nI disagree with is your statement that the U.S. Media is out to\nruin Israels reputation. That is rediculous. The U.S. media is\nthe most pro-israeli media in the world. Having lived in Europe\nI realize that incidences such as the one described in the\nletter have occured. The U.S. media as a whole seem to try to\nignore them. The U.S. is subsidizing Israels existance and the\nEuropeans are not (at least not to the same degree). So I think\nthat might be a reason they report more clearly on the\natrocities.\n	What is a shame is that in Austria, daily reports of\nthe inhuman acts commited by Israeli soldiers and the blessing\nreceived from the Government makes some of the Holocaust guilt\ngo away. After all, look how the Jews are treating other races\nwhen they got power. It is unfortunate.
Center for Policy Research writes...\n\n\n\n    Your comparison with the Warsaw Ghetto uprising is insulting,\n    and racist beyond belief.  The attempts to quiet any violence\n    in the Gaza Strip are just that.  The efforts to quell murder\n    and mayhem in the Gaza strip were the resluts of violence and\n    came AFTER the violence.  It was not an arbitrary racial move\n    like the nazi treatment of Jews.  Jews had NOT committed acts\n    of violence and murder as have the residents of Gaza.  I find \n    your eagerness to ignore the acts of murder nothing more than\n    anti-Israel bigotry.\n\n\n\n    It is NOT punishment, but protection from repeated attacks by\n    residents of Gaza.  You self-servingly omit any references to\n    WHY Israel has had to take action.  Apparaently the deaths of\n    innocent Israeli civilians do not enter into your equation, a\n    racist ommission on your part.\n\n\n\n    The right of Israel to protect its citizens from murderers is\n    also recognized by international law.  Israeli civilians have\n    been getting stabbed to death on a daily basis.  If this wave\n    of murder does not matter to you, then your posturing for the\n    basic human rights you claim matter so much to you is nothing\n    but an anti-Israel charade.\n\n\n\n    Do you know of residents of Gaza who have applied for Israeli\n    citizenship and were denied?  I have heard of no such denials\n    taking place.  Can you document this, or is this more of your\n    stupid and innacurate propaganda?  The truth is that if Gazan\n    residents applied for citizenship, HAMAS would murder them as\n    collaborators.\n\n\n	     Many Gazans are born in towns and villages located in\n\n    How dare you use such a disgusting phrase.  How very easy you\n    attack a people, when you omit facts which fly in the face of\n    your pure racism.  Perhaps you are judging a people to be the\n    racists that you are.  Do you believe that all Jews must have   \n    the same bigoted makeup as you?  \n    \n    Here's another little fly in your ointment, about the 'master \n    race,' for you to avoid...\n\n    Two months ago a plane with 86 Bosnian Muslims left Bosnia to\n    seek asylum in the middle east.  Four Arab nations refused to\n    grant them asylum.  Then when Israli Arabs agreed to take the\n    responsibility for them, they were allowed into Israel.  Yes,\n    Israel.  But when the plane landed, the Israeli Arabs who had\n    previously agreed to take care of them refused to be involved\n    with the rescue project, because they felt that it would make\n    Israel look good.  It was more important to avoid any good PR\n    for Israel than to take care of fellow Muslims.  Israel moved\n    them to a kibbutz, where they are safe and secure.  The truth\n    is that time after time the Islamic world has turned its back\n    on Muslims in need more than Israel has.  Even in the case of\n    the 400 deportees, Lebanon was willing to let their so-called\n    Arab brothers freeze to death rather than give them sanctuary\n    in Lebanon.  \n\n    Nearly twice as many Palestinians have been murdered by other\n    Palestinians than in confrontations with Israel.  Hundreds of\n    thousands of Palestinians had been deported from Kuwait, just\n    because they were Palestinian.  The truth is that your phoney\n    concern for the welfare of the Palestinians is nothing but an\n    excuse to attack Israel.  You are part of the ignorant effort\n    to confine all concern for the welfare of the Palestinians to\n    attacking Israel.  But the truth is there are greater reasons\n    than Israel for the plight of the Palestinians.  To disregard\n    Jordan or Kuwait or Saudi Arabia or any of the other oil-rich \n    nations who do nothing for these people, is to use the plight \n    of these poor people as a vehicle for your hatred of Jews, or\n    your hatred of Israel.  Anti-semitism and anti-Zionism is NOT\n    the same as pro-Palestinian and anyone who insists that it is\n    the same really does not give two hoots for their welfare.\n\n\n\n    Your pathetic analogy is so absent of relevant fact that your\n    racism cannot be disguised.  Jews had never declared war on a\n    Polish people.  Jews had never attacked Poles with knives, or\n    had used the Ghetto as a staging ground for attacks.  To take\n    something like the Warsaw Ghetto(the creation of which you do\n    not even bother to discuss!)and the uprising that followed is\n    to degrade the dead, and to show that intelligent debate on a \n    difficult situation is beyond your intellectual purview.  You\n    clearly have never even read a single word of the Covenant of \n    the Islamic Resistance Movement.  Here is arguably the single\n    most anti-semitic genocidal document since Mein Kampf, yet it\n    is totally disregarded in your rantings.  Your racism is most\n    evident in your eagerness to avoid such documentation.  If it\n    were considered, you might actually have to deal with mideast\n    problems in a balanced manner, rather than in an anti-semitic\n    manner.\n\n\n\n    And just how was Gaza obtained?  Do you forget that Israel is\n    not in the habit of grabbing land for the hell of it, but had\n    taken Gaza in a war that it did not start?  Did you know land\n    Israel captures in wars, wars which other nations have ALWAYS\n    started, aren't the same as Israel, and they are subject to a \n    completely different set of international laws?  Since you do\n    continuously refer to international law, would you please say\n    what specific international laws Israel is violating?  \n    \n\n						   This attitude\n\n    I can cite 6,000,000 reasons why it is not.\n\n\n\n    Where is this quote?  I have never heard Rabin assert that he\n    wished such a thing.  Since you are in general a liar, you'll\n    have to provide the entire quote, with source, or this effort\n    will be regarded as just another one of your fabrications.\n\n\n\n    Only you are led to ask such a loaded, racist, intellectually\n    dishonest question.  You inability to come to terms with what\n    you are has turned you into a racist of the highest order.\n\n\n\n    Why do you not feel the same compassion for the Jews of Iran,\n    or Iraq, or Yemen, or Saudi Arabia, or Syria?  Do you have an\n    inkling of what they have endured over the past decades?  Or,\n    what about the plight of the Palestinians in Kuwait?  Or what\n    about the treatment of the Bosnian Muslims?  Do you think the\n    residents of Gaza are being subjected to what all the Muslims \n    in Bosnia are enduring?  Why are you indifferent to the death\n    and suffering of people?  Why do you not care that these folk\n    are being exterminated?  Why do you not care that only Israel\n    has given any of these people safe haven?  Could it be due to \n    the fact that it is not Israel who is doing the killing?  The\n    people in Gaza are not being exterminated.  They aren't being\n    killed.  They aren't being raped.  They aren't being starved.\n    They aren't being driven from their lands.  They are not kept\n    from receiving food or other supplies.  But the Bosnians are.\n    And the ONLY country which has provided some sanctuary to the\n    Bosnian Muslims is the same nation that you have devoted your \n    life to attacking, in the guise of compassion.    \n\n    Your rantings are so unfettered by the burden of intellectual\n    honesty that you ought to take a deep breath and ask yourself\n    what your real motives are.  Do not flatter yourself into the\n    belief that truth or compassion are what drives you.  In your\n    case, it is clear that hate beats out love every time.  Maybe\n    you are burdened with some kind of guilt for having been born\n    a Jew.  It is obvious that your hatred of your own Judaism is\n    being dumped on all other Jews.  Why else would you suggest a\n    racist idea like breeding Jews out of existence?  Maybe these\n    fits of anti-semitism are a result of being cut off from your \n    own people for an extended period.  Whatever the case may be, \n    it is clear that you are not what you have labored so hard to \n    appear to be.  When you realize that you can't care for other \n    people while you hate yourself you might actually begin to do \n    some good.
You probably mean the mass murders of Jews in the West Bank between 1936-1939. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNaftaly

The Negev in the Year 2000\n\nJust after the creation of the State of Israel, the phrase "the\nJewish pioneers will make the desert bloom" was trumpeted\nthroughout the Western world. After the Six Day War in 1967, David\nBen-Gurion declared in a letter to Charles de Gaulle: "It's by our\npioneering creation that we have transformed a poor and arid land\ninto a fertile land, created built-up areas, towns and villages in\nabandoned desert areas".\n\nContrary to Ben-Gurion's assertion, it must be affirmed that\nduring the 26 years of the British mandate over Palestine and for\ncenturies previous, a productive human presence was to be found in\nall parts of the Negev desert - in the very arid hills and valleys\nof the southern Negev as well as in the more fertile north. These\nwere the Bedouin Arabs.\n\nThe real desertification of the Negev, mainly in the southern\npart, occurred after Israel's dispossession of the Bedouin's\ncultivated lands and pastures. Nowadays, the majority of the\n12,800 square-kilometer Negev, which represents 62 percent of the\nState of Israel (pre-1967 borders), has been desertified beyond\nrecognition. The main new occupiers of the formerly Bedouin Negev\nare the Israeli army; the Nature Reserves Authority, whose chief\nrole is to prevent Bedouin from roaming their former pasture\nlands; and vast industrial zones, including nuclear reactors and\ndumping grounds for chemical, nuclear and other wastes. Israeli\nJews in the Negev today cultivate less than half the surface area\ncultivated by the Bedouin before 1948, and there is no Jewish\npastoral activity.\n\nI. Agricultural and pastoral activities of the Negev Bedouin\nbefore and after 1948\n-------------------------------------------------- In 1942,\naccording to British mandatory statistics, the Beersheba\nsub-district (which corresponds more or less to Israel's Negev, or\nSouthern, district) had 52,000 inhabitants, almost all Bedouin\nArabs, who held 11,500 camels, 6,000 cows and oxen, 42,000 sheep\nand 22,000 goats.\n\nThe majority of the Bedouin lived a more or less sedentary life in\nthe north, where precipitation ranged between 200 and 350 mm per\nyear. In 1944 they cultivated about 200,000 hectares of the\nBeersheba district - i.e. 16 percent of its total area and *more\nthan double the area cultivated by the Negev's Jewish settlers\nafter 40 years of "making the desert bloom"*\n\nThe Bedouin had a very low crop yield - 350 to 400 kilograms of\nbarley per hectare during rainy years - and their farming\ntechniques were primitive, but production was based solely on\nanimal and human labor. It must also be underscored that animal\nproduction, although low, was based entirely on pasturing.\nProduction increased considerably during the rainy years and\ndiminished significantly during drought years. All Bedouin pasture\nanimals - goats, camels and sheep - had the ability to gain weight\nquickly over the relatively rainy winters and to withstand many\nwaterless days during the hot summers. These animals were the\nresult of a centuries-old process of natural selection in harsh\nlocal conditions.\n\nAfter the creation of the State of Israel, 80 percent of the Negev\nBedouin were expelled to the Sinai or to Southern Jordan. The\n10,000 who were allowed to remain were confined to a territory of\n40,000 hectares in a region were annual mean precipiation was 150\nmm - a quantity low enough to ensure a crop failure two years out\nof three. The rare water wells in the south and central Negev,\nspring of life in the desert, were cemented to prevent Bedouin\nshepherds from roaming.\n\nA few Bedouin shepherds were allowed to stay in the central Negev.\nBut after 1982, when the Sinai was returned to Egypt, these\nBedouin were also eliminated. At the same time, strong pressure\nwas applied on the Bedouin to abandon cultivation of their fields\nin order that the land could be transferred to the army.\n\nNo reliable statistics exist concerning the amount of land held\ntoday by Negev Bedouin. It is a known fact that a large part of\nthe 40,000 hectares they cultivated in the 1950s has been seized\nby the Israeli authorities. Indeed, most of the Bedouin are now\nconfined to seven "development towns", or *sowetos*, established\nfor them.
While that is currently true from their perspective, it is also\nworthwhile to note that in such cases the populace often does suffer\nfrom attempts to control the guerillas.  Furthermore, there were\ncases in the past of Palestinian gun emplacements being situated\nwithin villages.  The argument that can be made for small arms\nfire can not be made for field pieces.\n\n\nAs I recall, Amal was primarily nationalistically "Lebanon for\nthe Lebanese" motivated.  I think that the difference between them\nwas also a matter of funding and support.  One question does\ncome to mind however, \n\nGiven that you claim the Hizbollah to be more committed etc... and\nthat their stated position is:\n	1.  No peace talks.\n	2.  No peace talks.\n	.\n	.\n	.\n	.\n	N-1. No peace talks.\n	N.  No Israel\n\nif we assume that Lebanon and Syria are sincere in their desire for\npeace, why hasn't the Hizbollah been disarmed?\n\n\nBearing in mind the above and that military losses are more palatable\nthan civilian ones, I am sure you can understand why Israel is slow\nto act in that manner.\n\n\nI agree that Syria wants Lebanon to be part of its greater Syria.\nI don't necessarily see that the Syrians would be unhappy to see\nIsrael up to its neck in another Lebanese morass afterwhich Syria\ncould continue on its merry schedule when Israeli public opinion\nwould lead to a second pullout.\n\n\n<*sigh*>\n\nWhy can't some gov'ts negotiate as easily as some people?
Wrong.  Zionism *acknowledges* the fact that anti-Semites\nexist, and prevent Jews from living in peace.  That does not mean we\nagree that Jews are all greedy, that Jews kill Christian Children,\ncommited deicide, or anything else.  We acknowledge that there are\nmorons out there who do believe these things.\n\nAdam\n\n\n\nAdam Shostack 				       adam@das.harvard.edu
The Armenians were deeply anti-semitic as well. In the May 10, 1936 \nedition of 'Hairenik Weekly' the vice-mayor of Bucharest, Rumania is \nquoted as saying:\n\n"The Armenians helped us not to become the slaves of the Jewish\n elements in our country."\n\n\n"And the type of Jew who is imported to Palestine...is not anything\n to be proud about. Their loose morals, and other vices were\n unknown to the Arabs prior to Balfour Declaration, on top of \n all communist activities were the cause of most of the Arab\n criticism."[1]\n\nAs Uzun exposed, the Armenians were fascist. Before Pearl Harbor, \nthe Dashnak daily 'Hairenik' (not to be confused with the Tzeghagrons\n'Hairenik Weekly') expressed pro-Nazi sentiments:\n\n"And came Adolf Hitler, after herculean struggles. He spoke\n to the racial heart strings of the German, opened the \n fountain of his national genius, strock down the spirit\n of defeatism...At no period since the World War had Berlin\n conducted so realistic, well organized, and planned policy\n as now, since Hitler's assumption to power...And whatever\n others may think concerning Hitlerism and Fascism as a \n system of Government, it is proved that they have revitalized\n and regenerated the two states, Germany and Italy."[2]\n\n[1] Captain George Haig, 'The Case of Palestine,' in Hairenik\n    Weekly, Friday, September 25, 1936.\n[2] 'Hairenik,' official organ of the Dashnaktsuitune, Sept. \n    17, 1936; quoted in John Roy Carlson, 'The Armenian Displaced\n    Persons' (see endnote 1), p. 21.\n\n\nSerdar Argic
Please list the names of some of those neutral reporters that were killed\nin the "O.T.".  It is also interesting to note that at the outbreak of\nthe intifada, palestinian parties quickly began orchestrating their\ndemonstrations for the benefit of the media.  Having spoken to a Danish\nreporter who covered the initfada, I know of at least one case where\nhe found out that a "mass demonstration" on the outskirts of Gaza was\nsetup for himself and his colleagues.  When I asked whether the footage\nshot was sent he replied affirmatively, "after all, it did happen."\nWhen this became the case, the IDF began closing sensitive trouble\nspots to reporters.
