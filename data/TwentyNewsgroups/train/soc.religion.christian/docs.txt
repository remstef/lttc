Yes, it's important to realize that all actions have consequences,\nand that "rules" were made for our own good.  But to suggest that a\n*disease* is a *punishment* for certain types of sin I think is \ntaking things much too far.  If we got some kind of mouth disease\nfor lying, would any of us have mouths left?  What if we developed\nblindness every time we lusted after someone or something?  I dare\nsay all of us would be walking into walls.\n\nYes, sin can have terrible consequences, but we need to be *real*\ncareful when saying that the consequences are a *punishment* for \nsin.  The Jews of Jesus's time believed that all sickness was the\nresult of a sin.  Then Jesus healed a blind man and said that man was\nblind to show the glory of God, not because of sin.  If AIDS, or any\nother STD is a *punishment" for sexual sin, what do we do with \ndiseases like cancer, or multiple sclerosis, which are just as\ndebilitating and terrible as AIDS, yet are not usually linked to a\nspecific behavior or lifestyle?\n\nAtonement is *extremely* important, but I think you've missed the mark\nabout as far as you can by suggesting that AIDS is an atonement for sin.\nThe atonement for sin is JESUS CHRIST - period.  This is the central\nmessage of the Gospel.  A perfect sacrifice was required for our sins,\nand was made in the Lamb of God.  His sacrifice atoned for *all* of\nour sins, past present and future.  God does not require pennance for\nour sins, nor does he require us to come up with our own atonement.  He\nhas graciously already done that for us.  To suggest that AIDS or \nsome other consequence is an atonement for sins is literally spitting\non the sacrifice that Jesus made.\n\nIn case you couldn't tell, I get *extremely* angry and upset when\nI see things like this.  Instead of rationalizing our own fears and\nphobias, we need to be reaching out to people with AIDS and other\nsocially unacceptable diseases.  Whether they got the disease through\ntheir own actions or not is irrelevant.  They still need Jesus Christ,\nno more and no less than we do.  I've said this before, but I think\nit's a good analogy.  People with AIDS are modern-day lepers.  Jesus\nhealed many lepers.  He can also heal people with AIDS, maybe not on\nthis earth, but in an ultimate sense.  My next-door neighbor has AIDS.\nShe has recently come to have a much deeper and more committed \nrelationship with God.  Her theology isn't what I would want it to be,\nbut God's grace covers her.  The amazing thing is that she is gaining\nweight (she's had the disease for over 2 years) and her health is\nexcellent apart from occassional skin rashes and such.  She attributes\nher improvement in her health to God's intervention in her life.  Who\nare we to suggest that her disease is some kind of punishment?  It\nseems to me that God is being glorified through her disease.\n\nPaul Overstreet, the country singer, has a good song title that I \nthink applies to all of us - But for the Grace of God, There Go I\n(or something like that).\n\nMay we all experience and accept God's grace.\n\n\n===============================================================================\nPaul Conditt		Internet: conditt@titan.tsd.arlut.utexas.edu\nApplied Research	Phone:	  (512) 835-3422   FAX: (512) 835-3416/3259\n  Laboratories		Fedex:	  10000 Burnet Road, Austin, Texas 78758-4423\nUniversity of Texas	Postal:	  P.O.

Homosexual Christians have indeed "checked out" these verses.  Some of\nthem are used against us only through incredibly perverse interpretations.\nOthers simply do not address the issues.\n\nYou would seem to be more in need of a careful and Spirit-led course\nin exegesis than most of the gay Christians I know.  I suggest that\nyou stop "proof-texting" about things you know nothing about.
If the Papacy is infallible, and this is a matter of faith, then the \n   Pope cannot "be wrong!"  If, on the other hand, this is not a matter \n   of faith, but a matter of Church law, then we should still obey as the\n   Pope is the legal head of the church.\n\n   In other words, given the doctrine of infallibility, we have no choice\n   but to obey.\n\nThis is a primary problem in the Church today.  What you are saying is\nmore or less heresy.  You might call it "infallibilism".  It's the\nidea that the Pope is always right in everything he says or does.\nThis is virtually all over the place, especially in this country.\n\nThe Pope is only infallible under certain very specific and\nwell-defined conditions.  When these conditions are not met, he can\nmake mistakes.  He can make *big* mistakes.\n\nA couple historical examples come to mind.\n\nBishop Robert Grosseteste was perhaps the greatest product of the\nEnglish Catholic Church.  At one point during his career, the reigning\nPope decided to install one of his nephews in an English see.  Bishop\nGrosseteste said that this would happen over his dead body (though\nmaybe not in so many words; you have to treat Popes with respect, even\nwhen they are wrong).  The problem was that this nephew would just\ncollect the income of the see, and probably never set foot there.\nThis would deprive the people of the see of a shepherd.  Bishop\nGrosseteste was quite right in what he did!\n\nAnother example is that of Pope John XXII, a Pope of the Middle Ages.\nHe decided that souls that were saved did not enjoy the Beatific\nVision until the Last Judgement.  He decided that this should be a\ndefined doctrine of the Church.  Though he didn't quite get around to\ndefining it.  Now there's no way this is compatible with Catholic\ndoctrine.  The Pope's doctrine was criticised by many in the Church.\nHe went so far as to put a number of his opponents in jail, even.  In\nthe end, he had to admit his mistake.  Shortly before he died, he\nrecanted.  His successor made the exact *opposite* idea a dogma of the\nChurch.\n\nIf you consult any of the great Catholic theologians who treat of such\nsubjects, such as St. Robert Bellarmine (a Doctor of the Church), you\nwill find detailed discussions of whether the Pope can personally fall\ninto heresy or schism.
[">"= Mark, ">>"= mp]\n\n\n\n    I am sorry you find these charges amusing, Mark. I understand your\nfrustration though--it can be kind of scary to find your assumptions\nchallenged. Some of the specific cultural interference to which I refer\nincludes linguistic manipulation, for instance, their Tzotzil-Spanish\ndictionary removed both Spanish and Tzotzil words for concepts which are\nthreatening to the ruling ideology, e.g., class, conquer, exploitation,\nrepression, revolution, and described words which can express\nideological concepts in examples like "Boss--the boss is good. He treats\nus well and pays us a good wage." As some of my students would say,\n"NOT!"  \n     Your tone implies that you are unlikely to believe me--indeed, why\nshould you?

The answer to both questions is yes.\n\nAll Scripture is true, being inspired by God.  The evidence for this\nclaim has been discussed ad nauseum in this group.\n\nSimilarly, all truth is absolute.  Indeed, a non-absolute truth is a \ncontradiction in terms.  When is something absolute?  When it is always\ntrue.  Obviously, if a "truth" is not always "true" then we have a\ncontradiction in terms.  \n\nMany people claim that there are no absolutes in the world.  Such a\nstatement is terribly self-contradictory.  Let me put it to you this\nway.  If there are no absolutes, shouldn't we conclude that the statement,\n"There are no absolutes" is not absolutely true?  Obviously, we have a\ncontradiction here.\n\nThis is just one of the reasons why Christians defy the world by claiming\nthat there are indeed absolutes in the universe.\n\n\nSo?  People sometimes disagree about what is true.  This does not negate\nthe fact, however, that there are still absolutes in the universe.  Moreover,\nevangelical Christianity, at least, still professes to believe in certain\ntruths.  Man is sinful, man needs salvation, and Jesus is the propitiation\nfor mankind's sins, to name a few.  Any group that does not profess to\nbelieve these statements cannot be accurately called evangelical.

You might visit some congregations of Christians, who happen to be homosexuals,\nthat are spirit-filled believers, not MCC'rs; before you go lumping us all\ntogether with Troy Perry.  \n\nThe Lord IS working in our community (the homosexual community, that is).  He's\nnot asking us to change our sexual nature, but He is calling us to practice\nthe morality that He established from the beginning.\n\nIsn't Satan having a hayday pitting Christian against Christian over any issue\nhe can, especially homosexuality.  Let's reach the homosexuals for Christ. \nLet's not try to change them, just need to bring them to Christ.  If He\ndoesn't want them to be gay, He can change that.  If they are living a moral\nlife, committed to someone of the same sex, and God is moving in their lives,\nwho are we to tell them they have to change?\n\nThat's my two cent.
As our local.religion.christian BBS group seems moribund, I'm posting here.\n\nOn one of the Sundays just before Easter I went to church.  The sermon was\nbased on a story in the Book of Joshua.  (The one about Joshua sending out\nspies to the land he was planning to take)  What I particularly remember,\nbecause of having heard part of a CBC radio documentary on Bosnia, was that\nthe Rahab (the woman who sheltered the spies) said that the people were\n"melting in fear."  What with having heard that CBC radio documentary and\nknowing that the Muslims in Bosnia were losing the war, I felt\nuncomfortable.  After all, the Serbs are driving non-Christians out.  On\nthe other hand, ministers do say that the Bible is opposed to the values\nheld by our secular society.  Anyhow members of that church are involved in\nout-of-country missionary work.  Also, the pastor has talked of spiritual\nwarfare and of bringing Christ to the nonreligious people of our area.\n\nThe next Sunday, the sermon was about Joshua 6 (where the Israelites\ntake Jericho and then proceed to massacre everybody there --- except\nfor Rahab, who had sheltered the spies).  With those reports about\nBosnia in my mind, I felt uncomfortable about the minister saying that\nthe massacre (the one in Joshua) was right.  But what really bothered\nme was that, if I was going to try taking Christianity seriously, I\nshouldn't be so troubled about the reports of "ethnic cleansing" in\nBosnia.  Certainly, my sympathies shouldn't be with the Moslims.\nConsidering that the Bosnian Muslims are descendants of Christians\nwho, under Turkish rule, converted to Islam could the Serbs be doing\nGod's work?
Why is it that we have this notion that God takes some sort of pleasure\nfrom punishing people?  The purpose of hell is to destroy the devil and\nhis angels.\n\nTo the earlier poster who tried to support the eternal hell theory with\nthe fact that the fallen angels were not destroyed, remember the Bible\nteaches that God has reserved them until the day of judgement.  Their\njudgement is soon to come.\n\nLet me suggest this.  Maybe those who believe in the eternal hell theory\nshould provide all the biblical evidence they can find for it.  Stay away\nfrom human theories, and only take into account references in the bible.
my $.02 - Yes and No.  I do not believe the above scenario is not possible.  \nEither they are believing and living (in at least some part) led by God, else \nthey are not.  Believing (intellectually, but waiting(?)) is not enough.\n   Especially important to remember is that no one can judge whether you are \nso committed, nor can you judge someone else.  I guess the closest we can \ncome to know someone's situation is listening to their own statements.  This \ncan be fallible, as is our sense of communion one with another.\n\n\nRegarding this passage, we need to remember that this is a letter to a church \n(at Laodicea), people who are Of the Body of Christ. (Rev.3:14-16)  He talks \nabout their works.  A translation could say that he says their lack of \nconcern makes him sick (to the point of throwing up).\n\n   Right, saving is by faith alone, except that faith does not come alone, if \nyou catch the two meanings.\n   I can offer the explanation that Jesus would that we were either "on fire \nfor Him" or so cold we knew we were not in His will and thus could be made \naware of our separation.  This is admonishment for His children, not eternal \ndamnation.
I would recommend "Essential Truthes of the Christian Faith" by RC Sproul.\nIt is copywrited 1992 from Tyndale House Publishers. Sproul offers concise \nexplanations, in simple language, of around 100 different Christian \ndoctrines, grouped by subject. I think it would be particularly good for\nnewer Christians (and older Christians suffering spiritual malnutrition),\nas it gives a Biblically sound basic treatment of the issues, avoiding \nlong in-depth analysis that can wait until after you know the basics.
If you would bother to check in any good dictioanry or thesaurus, I think\nyou will find that "arrogance" has to do with an offensive exhibition of\npresumed or real superiority (a paraphrase from my own Webster's).\nArrognace is about pride and haughtiness. A person can believe in absolute\ntruth, even blindly (whatever that means) without being obnoxious about it.\nJust as a person can be a "humble," authority-questioning,\ndefying-any-theist-to-reply athiest and be quite arrogant. Arrogance is not\nabout what you believe, it is about how you relate to what you believe and\nhow you present it to others. If your overwhelming experience of Christians\nhas been that they are arrogant, I apologozing both for myself and on the\nbehalf of those who have offfended you. But my own experience, at least in\nforums like Usenet where you see a good mix of people, is that arrogant\nChristians and athiests seems to occur in about equal numbers.\n\n- Phil -
In a word, yes.  I don't believe that physical knowledge has a great deal of\nimpact on the power of God.  In the past, God gave us the ability to create\nlife through sexual relations.  Now, he is giving us the ability to create life\nthrough in vitro fertilization.  The difference between the two is merely \ncosmetic, and even if we gain the ability to create universes we won't begin to\napproach the glory of God.\n  The power we are being given is a test, and I am sure that in many cases we\nwill use our new abilities unwisely.  But, people have been using sexuality\nunwisely for millenia and I haven't heard an outcry to abolish it yet!\n  No matter how far we extend our dominion over the physical world, we aren't\nimpinging on God's power.  It's only when we attempt to gain control of the\nspiritual world, those things that can't be approached through science and \nlogic, that we begin to interfere with God.
Ah and how...??? Amen to that one!!!!!!  Thanks Chuck for sharing...\nafter all, no one can serve two masters...God and money......\nafter all, the preciousness of God as Lord and Savior is far more valuable than\nbeing a millionaire will ever be...
I differ with our moderator on this.  I thought the whole idea of God coming\ndown to earth to live as one of us "subject to sin and death" (as one of\nthe consecration prayers in the Book of Common Prayer (1979) puts it) was\nthat Jesus was tempted, but did not succumb.  If sin is not part of the\nbasic definition of humanity, then Jesus "fully human" (Nicea) would not\nbe "subject to sin", but then the Resurrection loses some of its meaning,\nbecause we encounter our humanity most powerfully when we sin.  To distinguish\nbetween "human" and "fallen human" makes Jesus less like one of us at the\ntime we need him most.\n\n\nFirst, the Monophysites inherited none of Nestorius's version -- they \nwere on the opposite end of the spectrum from him.  Second, the historical\nrecord suggests that the positions attributed to Nestorius were not as\nextreme as his (successful) opponents (who wrote the conventional history)\nclaimed.  Mainly Nestorius opposed the term Theotokos for Mary, arguing\n(I think correctly) that a human could not be called Mother of God.  I mean,\nin the Athanasian Creed we talk about the Son "uncreate" -- surely even \nArians would concede that Jesus existed long before Mary.  Anyway, Nestorius's\nopponents claimed that by saying Mary was not Theotokos, that he claimed\nthat she only gave birth to the human nature of Jesus, which would require\ntwo seperate and distinct natures.  The argument fails though, because\nMary simply gave birth to Jesus, who preexisted her either divinely,\nif you accept "Nestorianism" as commonly defined, or both natures intertwined,\na la Chalcedon.\n\nSecond, I am not sure that "Nestorianism" is not a better alternative than\nthe orthodox view.  After all, I find it hard to believe that pre-Incarnation\nthat Jesus's human nature was in heaven; likewise post-Ascension.  I think\nrather that God came to earth and took our nature upon him.  It was a seperate\nnature, capable of being tempted as in Gethsemane (since I believe the divine\nnature could never be tempted) but in its moments of weakness the divine nature\nprevailed.\n\nComments on the above warmly appreciated.\n\nJason Albert\n\n[There may be differences in what we mean by "subject to sin".  The\noriginal complaint was from someone who didn't see how we could call\nJesus fully human, because he didn't sin.  I completely agree that\nJesus was subject to temptation.  I simply object to the idea that by\nnot succumbing, he is thereby not fully human.  I believe that you do\nnot have to sin in order to be human.\n\nI again apologize for confusing Nestorianism and monophysitism.  I\nagree with you, and have said elsewhere, that there's reason to think\nthat not everyone who is associated with heretical positions was in\nfact heretical.  There are scholars who maintain that Nestorius was\nnot Nestorian.  I have to confess that the first time I read some of\nthe correspondence between Nestorius and his opponents, I thought he\ngot the better of them.\n\nHowever, most scholars do believe that the work that eventually led to\nChalcedon was an advance, and that Nestorius was at the very least\n"rash and dogmatic" (as the editor of "The Christological Controversy"\nrefers to him) in rejecting all approaches other than his own.  As\nregular Usenet readers know, narrowness can be just as much an\nimpediment as being wrong.  Furthermore, he did say some things that I\nthink are problematical.  He responds to a rather mild letter from\nCyril with a flame worthy of Usenet.  In it he says "To attribute also\nto [the Logos], in the name of [the incarnation] the characteristics\nof the flesh that has been conjoined with him ... is, my brother,\neither the work of a mind which truly errs in the fashion of the\nGreeks or that of a mind diseased with the insane heresy of Arius and\nApollinaris and the others.  Those who are thus carried away with the\nidea of this association are bound, because of it, to make the divine\nLogos have a part in being fed with milk and participate to some\ndegree in growh and stand in need of angelic assistance because of his\nfearfulness ...  These things are taken falsely when they are put off\non the deity and they become the occasion of just condemnation for us\nwho perpetrate the falsehood."\n\nIt's all well and good to maintain a proper distinction between\nhumanity and divinity.  But the whole concept of incarnation is based\non exactly the idea that the divine Logos does in fact have "to some\ndegree" a part in being born, growing up, and dying.  Of course it\nmust be understood that there's a certain indirectness in the Logos'\nparticipation in these things.  But there must be some sort of\nidentification between the divine and human, or we don't have an\nincarnation at all.  Nestorius seemed to think in black and white\nterms, and missed the sorts of nuances one needs to deal with this\narea.\n\nYou say "I find it hard to believe that pre-Incarnation that Jesus's\nhuman nature was in heaven."  I don't think that's required by\northodox doctrine.  It's the divine Logos that is eternal.

(MODERATOR: THIS IS A REPLACEMENT FOR AN EARLIER, MORE CLUMSILY WORDED\nSUBMISSION ON THE SAME TOPIC WHICH I SUBMITTED A FEW MINUTES AGO.)\n\nI think we need to distinguish etymology from meaning.  Regardless of\nhow the word 'Easter' *originated*, the fact is that it does not *now*\nmean anything to Christians other than 'the feast day of the Resurrection\nof Jesus Christ'. \n\nThe meaning of a word is _only_ what people understand it to mean.\n\nAnd the same goes for other cultural practices.  The festival of Easter\nmay possibly have some historical association with some pagan festival,\nbut *today* there are, as far as I know, no Christians who *intend* to\nhonor any kind of "pagan goddess" by celebrating Easter.\n\nIt is nonsense to say "this word (or this practice) 'really' means so-\nand-so even though nobody realizes it."  Words and practices don't mean\nthings, people do.  \n\n(This is basic semantics; I'm a linguist; they pay me to think about\nthings like this.)\n-- \n:-  Michael A.

No the members of the first group are not necessarily\narrogant.  But when I ask them if they are absolutely certain\nthat the volcano will erupt, I expect them to say so "No,\nbut I've chosen to believe some knowledgable people who have\ndetermined that the volcano will erupt," rather than, "Yes, I am\nabsolutely certain."  When it comes to religious discussions,\narrogance or at best naivete is reflected in the latter type of\nstatement.
Above all, love each other deeply, because love covers over a multitude of\nsins.
The people who post to this particular newsgroup are either too cowardly,\ntoo arrogant, or too apathetic to discuss this issue since I have yet to\nsee any discussion grace my computer screen.  While it holds PARTICULAR\ninterest to the African-American community, everyone has something to gain\nfrom discussing it.  As any knowledgable person should know, Christianity\nhas been used in this country to tighten the spiritual, emotional, & mental\nhold slavery placed on the minds, souls & hearts of African-Americans. \nThis was most effectively done by the display of white icons of Jesus in\nslave churches to encourage the godly superiority of slaveowners.  It\nwasn't enough that the slaveowner was your provider, but he was also your\nGOD, to be looked upon with unconditional love & loyalty and to be\nworshipped with great pride.  But how culturally & biblically accurate are\nthese icons?  Pictures & statues of a Black Jesus have been found in\nEuropean countries, as that of a Black Madonna.  But what about Biblical\nphysical descriptions of Jesus, His hair being compared to that of wool,\nHis feet to that of brass?  And think about the area of the world where all\nBiblical actions took place.  I welcome all intelligent commentary on this\nimportant topic; flamers need not reply.\n\nSherlette \n\nP.S.  I expect at least THIS type of response:  "It doesn't matter what\ncolor His skin was; His actions & what He did for mankind are what counts."\n This is true; I am not questioning this.  But He walked the earth for 3\ndecades as a HUMAN; this part of His existence intrigues me.  And as for\nsaying that "it doesn't matter..."  to a member of a physically emancipated\npeople who is still struggling for MENTAL emancipation, believe me:  IT\nMATTERS.
Well, I think that most Christians believe that your conciousness will\nsomehow continue on after your 'physical' death, which contradicts what\nmost atheists (myself included) believe, namely that your conciousness,\nbeing contained in your brain, dies when your brain dies.\n\n\nI fear the pain that often comes with the process of dying, but since I\nwon't be around to worry about it, I don't fear eternal death.\n\n\nThis is something I've always found confusing.  If all your nerve endings\ndie with your physical body, why would flame hurt you?  How can one "wail\nand gnash teeth" with no lungs and no teeth?
I have stated before that I do not consider myself an atheist, but \ndefinitely do not believe in the christian god.  The recent discussion\nabout atheists and hell, combined with a post to another group (to the\neffect of 'you will all go to hell') has me interested in the consensus \nas to how a god might judge men.  As a catholic, I was told that a jew,\nbuddhist, etc. might go to heaven, but obviously some people do not\nbelieve this.  Even more see atheists and pagans (I assume I would be \nlumped into this category) to be hellbound.  I know you believe only\ngod can judge, and I do not ask you to, just for your opinions.
I've been thinking about the idea that was raised (by Michael Covington, \nI think) that words mean what we think they mean, regardless of \netymology.  I've been reflecting on what certain words meant in my \nchildhood and tracing how this shaped some of my attitudes. \n\nI grew up in a home where Christ was a bad word.  People who were very \nangry said it.  The word Christian meant someone who was not a Jew.  It \ncarried connotations of otherness, of threat, of enemy.  It took some \ntime to figure out that there was a connection between `Christ' and \n`Christian'.  When I accepted Jesus, I expected to be disowned.  To \nbecome a Christian meant to join the enemy.  I knew others would \nconsider me a traitor.  At some level, I agreed, but was still prepared \nto pay this price.  Like Esau, I sold my birthright.  However, I made a \nbetter bargain.  He only got some stew, but I got the incomparable \nriches of knowing Christ.\n\nAs it turned out, my parents did not disown me.  I found out later that \nthey were hoping it was a phase that I would grow out of.  By the time \nthey had decided it wasn't a phase, they were sort of used to it.  They \ndidn't disown me but they didn't completely accept the situation either.  \nFor example, they didn't come to my wedding because it was in a church.   \nWhen I visited my grandmother in the hospital a few days before her \ndeath, she said to me, "As far as I'm concerned, you still are a Jew." \nWhat she meant was that she loved me and forgave me.  But I am not a \nJew.  I am a Christian.  (I'll concede, one that likes chicken soup with \nmatzoh balls.:-)) \n\nI do not keep kosher.  I do not celebrate the Sabbath on Saturday.  My \nsons are not circumcised.  But these things are true of some people who \ndo consider themselves Jews.  It is not these rules that make people \nJews; it is the heritage from the past.  I gave up the past.\n\nThis is why I find it hard to relate to Messianic Jews.  Their \nexperience is unlike mine.  They still consider themselves Jews while \nfollowing Jesus.  Some would even say that I *must* do so, too.  \n\nI am at a stage of my life now where I would like to have a heritage.  \nIt was not something I valued very much when I gave it.  But I did have \na sense that I was giving it for God.  It may have been a small \nsacrifice.  It may have been an unnecessary sacrifice.  But I gave it \nand do not want to ask for it back.\n\nAnd while I don't have the heritage I was born with, I do have another.  \nI am an outcast from the house of Israel, but I am a member of the \nChurch.  One of the things I like about being a Catholic Christian is \nthat it is rich in tradition.  It gives me a feeling of, once again, \nbeing rooted in the past. \n\nThis is probably one of the reasons why I don't like it when people mess \naround with Christian traditions (for example, changing the name of \nEaster).  These traditions fill an important emotional need of mine.\n\nI suppose the point of all this is that people shouldn't assume that all \nbelievers of Jewish background are the same.  For some `Jewish \nChristian' is a good name, for others it is an oxymoron.
Well, despite what my mother told me about accepting dares, here goes.\n \nYou have to be very careful about what you mean by "question authority".\nTaken literally, it is nonsense. That which is authoratative is authoratative,\nand to say "I question to word of this authority" is ridiculous. If it is \nopen to question, it isn't an authority. On the other hand, it is perfectly\nreasonable to question whether something is an authority. The catch phrase\nhere should be "authenticate authority." Once you have authenticated\nyour authority, you must believe what it says, or you are not treating it as\nan authority. \n\nThe difficulty is that authenticating an authority is not easy. You \ncan perhaps discredit a claim to authority by showing logical inconsistency\nin what it teaches, or by showing that it does not obey its own rules of\ndiscourse. But the fact that I cannot discredit something does not, in\ninself, accredit it. (Nor does the fact that I can convince myself and \nother that I have discredited something necessarilly mean that it is false.)\nI cannot accredit an authority by independantly verifying its teachings, \nbecause if I can independantly verify its teachings, I don't need an \nauthority. I need an authority only when there is information I need which\nI cannot get for myself. Thus, if I am to authenticate an authority, I must\ndo it by some means other than by examining its teachings. \n\nIn practical matters we accept all kinds of authorities because we don't\nhave time to rediscover fundamental knowledge for ourselves. Every scientist\nworing today assumes, on the authority of the scintific community, all sorts\nof knowledge which is necessary to his work but which he has not time to \nverify for himself.\n\nIn spiritual matters, we accept authority because we have no direct source \nofinformation. We select our authorities based on various criteria. (I am\na Catholic, in part, because the historical claims of the RC church seem\nthe strongest.) Without authorities there would be no subject matter for\nbelief, unless we simply made something up for ourselves (as many do).\n\nThe atheist position seems to be that there are no authorities. This is a\nreasonable assertion in itself, but it leads to a practical difficulty.\nIf you reject all authority out of hand, you reject all possibility of\nevery receiving information. Thus the atheist position can never possibly\nchange. It is non-falsifiable and therefore unscintific. \n\nTo demand scintific or rational proof of God's existence, is to deny\nGod's existence, since neither science, nor reason, can, in their very\nnature, prove anything.
Romans 8:28 (RSV)   We know that in everything God works for good with those \nwho love him, who are called according to his purpose. \n\nMurphy's Law:  If anything can go wrong, it will.\n\nWe are all quite familiar with the amplifications and commentary on\nMurphy's Law.  But how do we harmonize that with Romans 8:28?  For that\nmatter, how appropriate is humor contradicted by Scripture?
John 1:1 says (NKJV - the little green gideon someone forced on me one day)\n"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was \nGod."  The Word refers to Jesus Christ so from this John declares that God\nand Jesus are one.  Therefore, "The Lord" refers to both.  Also, David in the\nPsalms refers to both God in heaven and the coming messiah as his Lord.  Once\nagain this refers to God and Jesus.\n\n   swear/curse?  Does it say anything about this in the bible?\n\nSome of the most "truly religious" people I've known have not been Christians\nand some of the greatest Christians I've known have been truly irreligious.\nHowever, to answer your question:\nThe bible speaks of this in many places, A previous post to James is a good\none.  Another is Psalm 15:\n"Lord, who may abide in your tabernacle?  Who may dwell in your holy hill?  He\nwho walks uprightly, and works righteousness, and speaks the truth in his heart\nHe who does not backbite with his tongue, nor does evil to his neighbor, nor\ndoes he take up a reproach against his friend; I whose eyes a vile person is\ndespised, but he honors those who fear the Lord; he who swears to his own hurt\nand does not change; He who does not put out money at usury, nor does he take\na bribe aginst the innocent.  He who does these things shall never be moved."\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\nRob Coffey                    "Indeed the safest road to \ncoffey@cptc1.neep.wisc.edu     Hell is the gradual one- the\n(if you send mail to cptc2     gentle slope, soft underfoot,\n I'll never read it)           without sudden turnings, \n                               without milestones, without\n                               signposts."  -- Screwtape

I think you are vastly oversimplifying things. We know that early Christians\nsuffered totures because of their witness to Christ.  For example:\n\nACT 5:40    His speech persuaded them. They called the apostles in and had\n            them flogged. Then they ordered them not to speak in the name of\n            Jesus, and let them go.\n\nACT 5:41    The apostles left the Sanhedrin, rejoicing because they had been\n            counted worthy of suffering disgrace for the Name.\n\nIt appears that the Jewish rulers of that time had a particular aversion\nto even hearing Jesus's name.\nACT 5:28    "We gave you strict orders not to teach in this name," he said.\n            "Yet you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching and are\n            determined to make us guilty of this man's blood."\n\nFinally, the first apostle's death, James of Zebedee was certainly\nnot by Rome's hand any more than the first martyr Stephen. \n\n\n\nThe problem was that if one believed in the Resurrection, then one\nmust believe in Jesus as truly being the Son of God and what He\nstood for and preached during His ministry on Earth.  That would\nhave been extremely difficult for some people, especially those\nthat had plotted to kill Him.

I just thought I'd share a nice experience before my exam today.\nI was walking down the streets on our campus, and a beggar came up and asked\nme for any spare change I might have.  I had a dollar or so that I gave her,\nand - not wanting to give away all my money to strangers (I generally give\na dollar as that will buy a little food at McDonalds or something) - I offered\nher some "spiritual gifts," as I called them, rather than gifts of money.\nI talked of how great I felt that God had made such a pretty day, and how\nnice it was to give to people - she then said she was getting married soon.\nShe talked about how she and her husband had very little (they may not have\neven had a house, for all I know), but that they felt a very special love in\nthe Lord, an unselfish kind of caring.  It warmed my heart to know that 2\npeople can have so little monetarily, and realize that spiritually they are\nindeed very rich.  A good lesson for all of us who say we want more, more,\nmore; what we really need cannot be counted, or sold, or bought.
A listmember (D Andrew Killie, I think) wrote, in response to the\nsuggestion that genocide may sometimes be the will of God:\n\n > Any God who works that way is indescribably evil,\n > and unworthy of my worship or faith.\n\nNobuya "Higgy" Higashiyama replied (as, in substance, did others):\n\n > Where is your source of moral standards by which you judge God's\n > behavior?\n\nIt is often argued that we have no standing by which to judge God's\nactions.  Who is the clay to talk back to the potter? But we find a\ncontrary view in Scripture. When God proposes to destroy the city of\n\n + Suppose that there are some good men in the city.\n + Will you destroy the righteous along with the wicked?\n + Far be it from you, Lord, to do such a thing!\n + Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?\n\nI am told that the Hebrew is actually a bit stronger than this, and\ncan perhaps be better rendered (dynamic equivalence) as\n\n + Shame on you, Lord, if you do such a thing!\n\nThere are those who say that the definition of "good" is "whatever\nGod happens to want." But if that is so, then the statement that God\nis good has no meaning.  It simply says that God does what He wants.\nThat being the case, no one can either love or obey God because He\nis good. The only motive left for obeying Him is that He is\npowerful. Just as it makes sense to obey a dictator, even when he\ntells you to round up all Jews and exterminate them, because if you\ndefy him you might end up in the gas chamber yourself, so it makes\nsense to obey God, because He has the power to punish you if you\ndon't. This ethical theory I take to be in radical contradiction to\nGenesis 18 and to Christianity in general.\n\nAny theory that makes our moral judgements worthless makes any\nfurther discussion of morality (or of the goodness of God)\nmeaningless. However, it does not follow that our moral judgements\nare always infallible in particular cases, still less our judgements\nin particular cases about the course of action most likely to\nachieve a good result.\n\nWhen I read the Scriptural accounts of the actions of God in\nhistory, those actions often seem to me very different from what I\nmight expect of a God who loves us and desires what is best for us.\nMoreover, leaving the Scriptures aside, and considering the natural\nworld, I find that Nature is often very different from what I might\n"Those who believe that the Author of Nature is also the Author of\nthe Scriptures must expect to find in the Scriptures the same sort\nof difficulties that they find in Nature.")\n\nNow, that some such difficulties should exist is not in itself an\nargument against the existence, power, wisdom, and goodness of God.\nOn the contrary, their ABSENCE would be such an argument. Suppose\nthat I am watching Bobby Fisher play chess, and suppose that every\ntime he makes a move, I find myself nodding and saying: "Good move!\nJust what I was expecting him to do.  Same move I would have made if\nI were playing." That would be a sign that Fisher is no better a\nchess player than myself. Given that he is better, I expect that at\nleast some of his moves will have me thinking, "Now, what do suppose\ninduced him to do that?" or even, "Boy, that was a real slip -- he's\njust thrown the game away!" Similarly, if God understands the\nworkings of the universe better than I do, it is to be expected that\nsometimes it will look to me as if He has made a mistake.\n\nOne difference between Fisher at the chessboard and God at the\ncontrols of the universe is that I can see the end of the chess\ngame. If Fisher wins, I revise my earlier inference that it was\ncarelessness that made him lose his queen 23 moves earlier.\nHowever, if he loses, and particularly if I can see that there was a\ntime when he had an opportunity for a checkmate in two moves and did\nnot take it, then I know that he is not as good a player as I had\nthought.\n\nWith God, on the other hand, I shall not in this life see the total\nresult of some of His actions. Therefore, my grounds for judging\nthat I have seen a bad move on His part must always be far shakier\nthan my grounds for making a similar judgement about Fisher.\n\n     *****     *****     *****     *****     *****\n\nIn the book of Genesis, we read that Joseph's ten older brothers,\nwho (with good reason) found  him insufferable, conspired to sell\nhim into slavery in Egypt. There he eventually became Viceroy, and\nwhen there was a famine in Canaan, he was able to provide for his\nfamily. When his brothers nervously apologized, he told them: "Do\nnot worry. You meant to do me evil, but God turned it into good."\n\n\n        The history of the Jews is largely a history of events\n   that look like catastrophes that threaten the continued\n   survival of the religion, or the people, or both. But,\n   amazingly, those events turn out to be the saving of the Jews\n   and of Judaism.\n        The sale of Joseph by his brothers looked like the breakup\n   of the family.  But in fact, it ended with a reconciliation of\n   the quarrel between them. The famine that drove the family out\n   of Canaan looked like a misfortune for them.  But in fact, if\n   they had stayed in Canaan, they would almost certainly have\n   intermarried with the Canaanites and been assimilated into\n   their culture.  Their oppression by the Egyptians a few\n   generations after their arrival in Egypt again looked like a\n   disaster. But God used it to bring them out of Egypt, and into\n   the Promised Land.\n        Here the people built a Temple, and regularly offered\n   sacrifices. But the Babylonians captured Jerusalem and Judea,\n   destroyed Temple and city and countryside, and deported most of\n   the people to Babylon. You might have thought that that would\n   be the end of the people and the religion. But it was not.\n   Living in Canaan, the people had been under constant danger of\n   assimilation.  Again and again, they had turned from the\n   worship of the LORD to the worship of the Canaanite fertility\n   cults, with their ritual prostitution and ritual human\n   sacrifice. The Babylonian captivity put a stop to that. Never\n   again did the Jews show any interest in polytheism or idolatry.\n   Neither the worship of the Canaanites mor that of the\n   Babylonians ever again had a foothold among them.\n        Nor is that all. Judaism had been in danger of becoming\n   simply a system of sacrifices and Temple observances. The only\n   prescribed acts of worship consisted of coming to Jerusalem\n   every so often and offering a sacrifice. During the Captivity,\n   with the Temple gone, the Jews invented the synagogue, a place\n   of meeting for reading and study and discussion of the\n   Scriptures. They came to realize clearly, what they were in\n   danger of forgetting while they continued to live in Judea,\n   that God is not simply a local or tribal deity, not just the\n   controller of the land of Canaan, or the patron of the Jewish\n   people, but the Creator of the world, and the Ruler and Judge\n   of all humans everywhere.\n        Time passed, and the Babylonian Empire was replaced by\n   that of the Persians, and then that of the Greeks, or rather\n   the Macedonians. The ruler, Antiochus Epiphanes, was determined\n   to stamp out Judaism, and to this end he made the reading and\n   the study of the Torah punishable by death. Again, one might\n   think that this would be the end of Judaism. But it was not.\n   The people met for worship, and instead of reading the Torah\n   portion appointed for the day, they would read some passage\n   from the prophets that had a similar theme, and then discuss\n   that.  Before this time, the Torah, the so-called Five Books of\n   Moses (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy)\n   were the only books read and studied in the synagogue.  If it\n   had not been for Antiochus, the books of the prophets would\n   probably have been forgotten altogether. His hatred for Judaism\n   saved them.\n\n        [Other examples here omitted for brevity's sake.]\n\n        Some of you may remember that Julie Andrews first became\n   famous as Eliza Doolittle in the stage production of MY FAIR\n   LADY. When Warner Brothers undertook to make a movie of it,\n   everyone expected that Julie, who had been so magnificent on\n   stage, would play the same role in the movie. Instead, the\n   studio decided to go with an established screen star, and cast\n   Audrey Hepburn.  Julie Andrews was naturally crushed. But she\n   later realized that if she had played the screen role, she\n   would have been type-cast for life as an Elize Doolittle type.\n   It would have been a disaster for her. As it was, Walt Disney\n   offered her the role of Mary Poppins, and she won an Oscar for\n   it.  At the presentation, she stood there, smiling, and looking\n   at Walt Disney, she said, "And now, my special thanks to the\n   man who made all this possible -- JACK WARNER!" It was the most\n   memorable line of the evening.\n        In a similar spirit, we Jews might thank the men who in\n   the providence of God have preserved Judaism, and kept it alive\n   to this day, beginning with Joseph's brothers, and continuing\n   with two Pharaohs, with Nebuchadnezzar, with Antiochus\n   Epiphanes....\n\nAfter the formal meeting had broken up, one woman came up to him\nprivately and said, "You were talking about the Holocaust, weren't\nyou?" He answered, "If that is an example that came to your mind,\nthen you are right, I was talking about it to you. But I would not\ntalk about it to everyone, for not everyone can bear it." I assume\nthat he meant that, without the Holocaust, there would have been no\nstate of Israel.\n\nSomeone hearing the rabbi's lecture might leap to the conclusion\nthat God is dependent on the wickedness of men to accomplish His\npurposes -- or at least that the rabbi thought so. He might then  go\non to suppose that the wickedness is in fact God's doing -- that He\nstirred up Joseph's brothers to a murderous hate against him, and\nthat when the Israelites were in Egypt, God hardened Pharaoh's\nheart, so that he oppressed the people, and would not let them go.\nAnd this raises questions about how an action can be considered\nwicked and at the same time be considered something that God has\nbrought about.\n\nI suggest another way of looking at it. Consider a sculptor who has\na log of wood from which he proposes to carve a statue. But the log,\ninstead of having a smooth even grain throughout, has a large knot\nthat spoils the appearance of the surface. The sculptor considers\nthe wood for a while, and then carves a statue that features the\nknot, that makes that particular interruption in the grain and color\nof the wood correspond to some feature of the statue, so that\nobservers will say: "How fortunate the sculptor was in finding a\npiece of wood with a knot like that in just the right place. Its\npresence is the crowning touch, the thing that makes the statue a\ngreat work of art." In reality, the knot, far from being what the sculptor was\nlooking for, was a challenge to his skill. If the wood had not\ncontained that flaw, he would still have made a great work of art,\nbut a different one. So, if Joseph's brothers had not sold him, God\nwould still have brought about His purposes for the Jewish people,\nbut He would have done so in another manner. If Judas had not\nbetrayed Jesus, if Caiaphas and his fellow leaders had not rejected\nJesus, but had rather acknowledged Him as the Annointed of God, if\nPilate had followed his conscience rather than his fears and had set\nJesus free, it might appear that there would have been no\nCrucifixion, and therefore no Redemption, and therefore no\nSalvation. Not so. God did not need Judas' sin to redeem us. If\nJudas had done right, then God in Christ would still have reconciled\nthe world to Himself.  We do not know how, just as we do not know\nhow Michelangelo would have painted the Sistine Chapel if its\ninterior had instead been shaped like Grand Central Station, and\njust as we do not know how Bobby Fisher would have won his fourth\ngame agianst Spassky if Spassky had refused the exchange of bishops\nand had attacked Fisher's knight instead (don't bother to look up\nthe game in question--I am making up this example, but the point is\nnone the less valid).\n\nThus, we may say both (1) that God used, say, the cowardice of\nPilate to accomplish His purposes, and (2) that the said cowardice\nwas not God's doing, and that Pilate would not have thwarted God's\nplans by behaving justly and courageously.\n\nWhat, then, are we to make of the place where God says to Moses, "I\nwill harden Pharaoh's heart, so that he will not let the people go"?\nSome Christians have taken this to mean that Pharaoh was a puppet\nwith God pulling the strings, and that his stubbornness and cruelty\nwere not his own work, but the work of God in him. I suppose rather\nthat what God was telling Moses was something like this: "If you see\nthat Pharaoh is not willing to let the people go, do not be\ndiscouraged, or suppose that the situation is out of my control. My\npurposes will not be thwarted. If Pharaoh chooses to hear you and\nlet the people go, well and good. If he does not, I will fit his\nresistance into my plans, and fit it so perfectly that future\nhistorians and theologians will suppose that I would have been\nthrown for a loss if Pharaoh had obeyed me."\n\nTo return to the question that started this all off. Is it possible\nthat the Serbs, in slaughtering the Moslems of Bosnia, are\ninstruments of God's will?\n     First point. What they are doing is wrong, just as what\nJoseph's brothers did was wrong, just as what Judas did was wrong.\nThey intend it for evil. If God somehow brings good out of it, that\ndoes not make them any less subject to just condemnation and\npunishment.\n     Second point. Of course, God will bring good out of it. But not\nthe same good that He would have brought if the Serbians had\nrefrained from the sins of robbery and rape and murder. Nor does the\ngood He purposes excuse us from the duty of doing what is right.
Let me tell you my story.\nI grew up catholic. Up until I was 14, it wasn't an issue for me. Then I met\na born-again christian, a very sweet person, not proseletyzing(sp?), not \nimposing. I tried to get into being as christian as I could, as I felt I \n'should'.\n\nBut the more I tried, the more depressed I got. I felt guilty for some of my\nown personal, honest feelings. I tried so hard to reconcile this conflict.\nuntil I was 23.\n\nThen I taught myself to think rationally. I read a lot of books, pro and con \nreligion in general and, specifically, catholicism. I came to a crisis point,\nthen it finally clicked and now I am a staunch atheist. \n\nThis is a very loose explanation, but it's the gist of it.\n\nNow, (at 26) I feel better about myself, better self-esteem, a generally \nstronger person. I have well-defined goals. I have a strong and stable sense \nof morals and values. I am not a neo-nazi or a corrupt politicain, etc. I \nbelieve in human rights and 'live and let live' among other things. I am very \nanti-violent and anti-hatred. (This is to debunk the myth that atheists are\ndepraved.)\nReligion has no place in my system.\nTough.\n\nBertrand Russell said that we cannot *know* god doesn't exist, we can't prove \nit. So, in that sense, we can only truly be agnostic. But, for all practical\npurposes there is no god.
Does that imply that people who take marriage vows but aren't sincere\nare not married?
Responding to the moderator:\n\n\nYes, I agree.  What I'm trying to point out is that, in matters of faith\n(i.e. tenets which are not logically persuasive), one may be convinced\nof the truth of certain things through, for instance, personal\nrevelation.  And its certainly fine to share that revelation or those\nbeliefs with others.  And I don't think that its arrogant, persay, to\naccepts matters of pure faith as truth for oneself.  Where I think the\nconflict arises is in assuming that, where disagreements on beliefs\narise, all others *must* have been given the same truth, and that God \nmust reveal His truth to everyone in such a way that all would \nhonestly agree.  I think this can lead to the conclusion that anyone \nwho disagrees with you are being sinful or dishonest; that they are \nrejecting something they *know* to be truth because it is inconvenient \nfor them, or because they wish to spurn God.\n\nI would say that this is equivalent to assuming that *all* truths one \nholds are universal and absolute.  And the problem I see with this is \nthat it negates the individuality of humans and their relationships with\nGod.  This does not mean there is no absolute truth; just that some areas\nof doctrinal disagreement may be areas where God has not established or \nrevealed that truth.  \n\n-- \ncomments, criticism welcome...\n-Ken\nalvin@ucsu.colorado.edu
Pardon me if this is the wrong newsgroup.  I would describe myself as\nan agnostic, in so far as I'm sure there is no single, universal\nsupreme being, but if there is one and it is just, we will surely be\njudged on whether we lived good lives, striving to achieve that\ngoodness that is within the power of each of us.  Now, the\ncomplication is that one of my best friends has become very\nfundamentalist.  That would normally be a non-issue with me, but he\nfeels it is his responsibility to proselytize me (which I guess it is,\naccording to his faith).  This is a great strain to our friendship.  I\nwould have no problem if the subject didn't come up, but when it does,\nthe discussion quickly begins to offend both of us: he is offended\nbecause I call into question his bedrock beliefs; I am offended by\nwhat I feel is a subscription to superstition, rationalized by such\ncircular arguments as 'the Bible is God's word because He tells us in\nthe Bible that it is so.'  So my question is, how can I convince him\nthat this is a subject better left undiscussed, so we can preserve\nwhat is (in all areas other than religious beliefs) a great\nfriendship?  How do I convince him that I am 'beyond saving' so he\nwon't try?  Thanks for any advice.
I am asking you to believe in things not visible. I don't know if this is\nbelieveing blindly or not. I'm not sure how blindness comes into it. I do\nnot deny reason, indeed I insist upon it, but reason only draws conclusions\nfrom evidence. If you decide in advance that your reason will act only on\nthe evidence of the five physical senses, then you cut reason off from any\npossibility of reaching a conclusion outside the physical sphere (beyond the\nrather provocative, if inconclusive, conclusion that the physical sphere\nis not self explanatory). \n\nChristians claim that they have received a different kind of evidence, \nwhich they call faith, and which is a gift of God. That is, this evidence\nis the evidence of a thing which chooses to reveal or hide itself. The \nevidence of the senses cannot tell you is such a ting exists. Reasoning\non the evidence of the senses won't help either. But Christians do reason\nof the evidence of faith, and do claim that this evidence is wholly\nconsistent with the evidence of the other senses, and indeed, that the\nevidence of these other senses is part of God's revelation of himself\nto us.\n\nIt is not necessarilly the case however that knowledge of a God must come\nthrough this route. There may be other senses than the physical ones\nproviding evidence of non-physical realities. (There may, of course, be\nphysical realities of a type for which we have no corresponding senses, for\nall we know.) These senses, if they exist, may provide valid evidence for\nreason to work on. And, as with all senses, these senses may be impaired\nin some people, that is, they may be spiritually blind. In this sense,\nbelief in God becomes an act of sight, and it is disbelief which is blind.\n\nFaith, as I have said, is not opposed to reason, it is simply a new source \nof evidence on which reason may operate. It is clear that human beings\nhave many systems for explaining the evidence of the physical senses, and\nsimilarly there are many systems for explaining the evidence provided by\nfaith. Religious believers in general, and Christians in particular, use\nreason to help sift through the evidence to come to a clearer understanding\nof the evidence provided by faith. Science claims, with good reason, to be\nthe most valid system for explaining the physical universe, and Christianity\nclaims, also with good reason, to be the most valid system, possessed of the\nbest evidence, for explaining Gods revelations of himself to man.\n\nIf you doubt that Christians use reason, read this newsgroup for a while\nand you will see rational debate aplenty.
It is funny how this one little quote from Genesis is treated\nby certain anti-Christians as if Christians have been given a\nfirm command to destroy the earth. You could prove almost\nanything by taking little quotes out of context from the Bible\n- it's a big book, you know. I doubt you could find a single\ncase of a anti-ecological action taking place specifically\nbecause teh perpetrator was motivated by a Christian belief.\n\nAs for the Nazis, they were motivated by German Nationalism,\nnot by Christianity. In fact they despised Christianity as a\nweak pacifist religion, and were much more keen on pagan\nglorification of strength and warfare. They killed the Jews\nbecause they were not Germans, not because they were\n"Christ-killers" - they were just as keen on killing the other\nnon-German ethnic minority, the Romanies or Gypsies.
I have seen Jeff Fenholt speak and I didn't find him judgemental.  I think\nthat the wording for that add was certainly inappropriate, but I think they\nwere trying to say that headbangers would like the program.  But I would\nNOT put headbangers in the same class as alcholics, etc.  it is\ncondescending.  And I believe that Jeff was wearing black when I saw him.\n\nBy the way, Fenholt played Jesus in Jesus Christ Superstar.\n\nPersonally, I'm a headbanger at times too, but I have a hard time with what\nmost of the secular metal groups promote.  Free sex and drugs (my opinion\nthat many promote these) aren't my thing.  I HAVE found several good\nChristian metal groups that I like.\n\n\nJon\n\n------------------------------------------------\nJon Ogden         - jono@mac-ak-24.rtsg.mot.com\nMotorola Cellular - Advanced Products Division\nVoice: 708-632-2521      Data: 708-632-6086\n------------------------------------------------
I was waiting for this. I think your question should be rephrased. The many\nverses of the Bible which condem homosexuality (by our beliefs) have been\nshoved down the throats of homosexuals for a long time by (well-meaning?)\nChristians. The question is how do they interpret these verses. Any discussion\nof any issue (this or any other issue) requires a proof of your case as well\nas a disproof of the opposing view. We are already familiar with those verses\nand many have proven to themselves that these condem homosexual behaviour. We\nmust now establish reasons for not believing this to be true based on the\ninterpretation of these scriptures given by someone who has come to grips with\nthem.
Between Adam and Eve and Golgotha the whole process of the fall of man\noccurred.  This involved a gradual dimming of consciousness of the spiritual\nworld.  This is discernable in the world outlooks of different peoples through\nhistory.  The Greek, for example, could say, "better a beggar in the land\nof the living than a king in the land of the dead." (Iliad, I think).\n\nThe question of what happens to human beings who died before Christ is\nan ever present one with Christians.  I am not ready to conscign Adam\nor Abraham, or even Cain to eternal damnation.  Yet they all died in their\nsins, in the Christian sense.  The same can be said of the whole of  Gentile\nhumanity, and also of the unrepentant malefactor on the cross next to\nhim.  I do not limit the power of Christ to save even him, through whom\nSatan would mock his deed of salvation at the very moment of its fulfillment.\n\n\nIt is possible to experience eternity in a passing moment.  The\nrelationship of eternity to duration is not simply one of indefinitely\nextended conditions of Greenwich mean time. It is possible to imagine\nan eternity of agony or bliss - or even many of them - in the\nspiritual world during the time between earthly death and a new birth.\n\nIt was also a standard belief among many peoples that even the righteous\nwere lost. This again is the result of the loss of the paradisal consciousness\nthat fled from us after the fall, with our ever increasing involvement with\nthe sense world.\n\nIt would be interesting to share in the results of your studies of ancient\npeople's ideas of life after death.\n\n\nMankind fell into mist and darkness, and at "the turning point of\ntime" a new light entered into the world.  The light still grows, and\nwe are developing the eyes with which to see by it.  Much new\nrevelation and growth in under- standing lies before us.  Our new\nvision and understanding is still very feeble, but it contains\nsomething new that will grow in time to embrace that which is old and\nmuch more as well.\n\n(At this point I should acknowledge openly my debt to the work of Rudolf\nSteiner, founder of Anthroposophy, for  many insights that have led me to my\nviews on this subject).\n\n\nThe way you refer to it as "doctrine" puts a modern intellectual coloring\non it. I think it was much less abstract and much more real and spiritually\nconcrete, a teaching that struck much closer to home than our doctrines or\nteachings today can be received.\n\nI am not so ready to attribute widespread notions in antiquity to\nsimple dispersion from an original source.  Even if they were passed\non, the question is, to what extent did they reflect real perception\nand experience?  The similarity in the midst of great variety of\nexpression of the different people's ideas of the time immediately\nafter death testifies to the presence of an underlying reality.  In\nany case, we study geometry not by reading old manuscripts of Euclid,\nbut by contemplating the principles themselves.\n\nOn the other hand, there is one notion firmly embedded in Christianity\nthat originated most definitely in a pagan source.  The idea that the\nhuman being consists essentially of soul only, and that the soul is\ncreated at birth, was consciously adopted from Aristotle, whose ideas\ndominated Christian thought for fifteen hundred years and still does\ntoday. He was at once the father of modern thought and at the same\ntime lived during that darkened time when the perception of our\neternal spiritual being had grown dim.\n\n\nIndeed. I should also clarify that I do not deny that eternal\nirrevocable damnation is a real possibility.  But the narrow range in\nwhich we conceive of the decisive moment, i.e. after the end of a\nsingle earthly life, is not in my mind sufficient to embrace the\nreality, and I think that is why the early creeds were couched in\nterms that did not try to spell it out.
just picked out this one point because it struck me....\nwhy do you believe this?  muslims believe in many of the same things\nthat christians and jews believe; they believe jesus, while not the\nmessiah, is a prophet.  this seems to me to be much closer to\nchristianity than other religions are.  (then again i tend to be\nsomewhat liberal about others' beliefs.)\n\nthis also relates to the serbian "ethnic cleansing" question.  i have\nbeen waiting for condemnations of this and have seen very few.  HOW\ncan we stand by and watch innocent people, even people whose beliefs\nwe condemn, if this is the case (and don't get me wrong, the things\nfundamenalist muslims have to say about women make my blood boil), be\ntortured, raped (the stories about that made me physically ill), and\nkilled?  jesus loves all, not just those who love him back -- and he\nwould advocate kindness toward them (in the hopes of converting them,\nif that's the way you want to put it) rather than killing them.  \n\ni'm sorry i got off the subject here -- maybe i should have used a\ndifferent title.  i did need to get this off my chest, however.\n\npeace (shalom),\nvera shanti\n_______________________________________________________________________________\nHand over hand				noye@midway.uchicago.edu\nDoesn't seem so much			(Vera Noyes)\nHand over hand				\nIs the strength of the common touch	drop me a line if you're in the mood\n	- Rush, "Hand Over Fist"\n_______________________________________________________________________________\n\n[I am also worried about this issue.  I've made a posting under my own\nname earlier today.  I do not much want to discuss Moslem beliefs\nhere.  This isn't the right group for it.  Their beliefs about Jesus\nappear to come as much from the Koran as the Bible.  This means that\nwhile they honor him, what they think he did and stood for differs in\nmany ways from Christian beliefs about him.  But Moslem beliefs are\nan appropriate topic for soc.religion.islam.\n\nAs I'm sure you know, many Christians believe that you must accept\nChrist in order to be saved.  While Stanley's comment appears to be\nanti-Moslem, I would assume he would say the same thing about all\nreligions other than Christianity.
I haven't followed whatever discussion there may have been on these\npeople, but I feel that C. S. Lewis is an excellent apologist and I\nsee no reason for embarrassment.  If you think that errors and flawed\narguments are a reason for dismissing a thinker, you must dismiss\nnearly every thinker from Descartes to Kant; any philosophy course\nwill introduce you to their weaknesses.  \n \n  The above also expresses a rather odd sense\n\nI said nothing about "the masses."  However comparing "the masses" in\nour day and in Aquinas' day really *is* odd.  Read Ortega y Gasset on\nthis.\n\nI'm talking about the familiar experience of arguing all night and\nwinning on logic and evidence, only to discover your opponent to be\nunaware, even intuitively, of things like entailment (let alone\npragmatics).  (I am assuming that both parties are college graduates\nor better...)  Myself, I don't bother any more.\n\nKen
Which means he has absolutely no idea about what the Assumption is.\n\nHowever greatly we extoll Mary, it is quite obvious that she is in no\nway God or even part of God or equal to God.  The Assumption of our\nBlessed Mother, meant that because of her close identification with the\nredemptive work of Christ, she was Assumed (note that she did not\nASCEND) body and soul into Heaven, and is thus one of the few, along\nwith Elijah, Enoch, Moses (maybe????) who are already perfected in\nHeaven.  Obviously, the Virgin Mary is far superior in glorification to\nany of the previously mentioned personages.\n\nJung should stick to Psychology rather than getting into Theology.
I was at my parents' Seder and noticed the labelling on one of the \npackages was English, Hebrew and French.  In the phrase "kosher for \npassover" the French word used was "Pa^ques."   We've deliberately \nmistranslated this at the Kulikauskas home and keep referring to foods \nbeing kosher for Easter. :-)\n\nBack to the original questions in this thread concerning Christians of \nJewish descent and the Law:  I always wonder when I see posts on this \nsubject whether the writers are Christians of Jewish descent relating \nthe life-decisions God has led them to or people who take only an \nacademic interest in the topic.  (Having known Seanna since she was nine \nyears old, I do know in this case.)  I admit that the answer to this \nquestion affects the amount of weight I give to the writer's statement.
I have found that this isn't a very effective argument.  Most atheists are\nperfectly willing to acknowledge the existence and ministry of Jesus--but are\nquite capable of rationalizing the miracles and the resurrection into \nmisunderstandings, hoaxes, or simple fabrications.  They can always make an\nanalogy with the _Iliad_, a book that tells the story of the historical Trojan\nWar, but also talks about gods and goddesses and their conversations.\n  I don't think it's possible to convince atheists of the validity of \nChristianity through argument.  We have to help foster faith and an\nunderstanding of God.  I could be wrong--are there any former atheists here who\nwere led to Christianity by argument?

Many pagans are involved in environmentalism--this is only natural, since\nrespect for the earth is a fundamental tenet of all pagan denominations.  This\ndoesn't mean that environmentalism is wrong, any more than supporting peace in\nthe Middle East is wrong because Jews and Muslims also work for it.\n\n  Nonetheless, paganism is certainly on the rise, and we as Christians should\naddress this and look at what draws people from paganism to Christianity.  Like\nit or not, pagan religions are addressing needs that Christianity should be,\nand isn't.  \n  I believe that paganism has hit upon some major truths that Christianity has\nforgotten.  This doesn't mean that paganism is right, but it does mean that we\nhave something to learn from the pagan movement.\n  First, paganism respects the feminine.  Christianity has a long history of\noppressing women, and many (if not most) male Christians are still unable to\nlive in a non-sexist manner.  The idea that God is sexless, or that Christ \ncould have been a women and still accomplished his mission, is met with a great\ndeal of resistance.  This insistance on a male-dominated theology (and the \nmale-dominated society that goes with it) drives away many young women who have\nhad to put up with sexist attitudes in their churches.\n  Second, paganism respects the physical world.  This is an idea with great\nramifications.  One of these is environmentalism--respect for our surroundings\nand our world.  Another is integration of sexuality.  Christianity has a long\ntradition of calling ALL sexual feeelings sinful and urging people to suppress\nand deny their sexuality.  This is too much--sex is clearly a part of human\nexperience and attempting to remove it is simply not a feasible option.  \nChristianity has only begun to develop a workable sexual ethic, and paganism\nis an attractive option.\n  I'm not advocating that Christian doctrines (no sex before marriage, etc.)\nshould be changed--just that Christians work toward a more moderate ethic of\nsexuality.  Denial of sexuality places as much emphasis on sex as unmoderated\nsexuality, and neither one does much to bring us closer to God.
In a cell church, the fundamental building block is the "cell group" -- a\nsmall group of no more than 15 believers.  The small groups are responsible\nfor the ministry of the church: evangelism and discipleship.  The emphasis\nis on relationships, not on programs, and both the evangelism and the\ndiscipling are relationship-based.\n\nThis will probably raise more questions than it answered, but that's it in\na nutshell.
A few points about Mary's being taken into heaven at the end of her life on\nearth:\n\nOne piece of evidence for Mary's assumption into heaven is the fact\nthat no Christian church ever claimed to be the sight where she was\nburied. Some Christian churches claimed to be located at the final\nresting places of Peter, Mark, and other saints, but no one ever\nclaimed to possess the body of Mary, the greatest of the saints. Why?\nBecause everyone knew that she had been taken up into heaven.\n\nAlthough there is no definitive scriptural proof for the assumption of\nMary, some passages seem suggestive, like the passage in Revelation\nthat describes a woman giving birth to a Son and later being crowned\nin the heavens. Of course, the woman in this passage has other\ninterpretations; she can also be taken a symbol for the Church.\n\nThe assumption of Mary makes sense because of her relationship to\nChrist.  Jesus, perfect God and perfect man, fulfilled the\nrequirements of the law perfectly.  Under the law God gave to us, we\nare to honor our mother and father, and Christ's act of taking his\nmother into heaven is part of his fulfillment of that law. Also, he\ntook his flesh from her, so it seems appropriate that he decide not to\nallow her flesh to rot in the grave.\n\nOne last point: an ex-Catholic attempted to explain Catholic doctrine\non the assumption by asserting it is connected to a belief that Mary\ndid not die. This is not a correct summary of what Catholics believe.\nThe dogma of the assumption was carefully phrased to avoid saying\nwhether Mary did or did not die. In fact, the consensus among Catholic\ntheologians seems to be that Mary in fact did die. This would make\nsense: Christ died, and his Mother, who waited at the foot of the\ncross, would want to share in his death.

Some thoughts:\n\n[A. On the non-pacifist side:]\n\n(1) Killing to defend the innocent may be, if anything, _more_ justifiable\nthan killing in self-defense.  I can turn my _own_ other cheek, but I have\nno right to turn someone else's.\n\n(2) It seems to me that if Jesus had meant to teach pacifism, He would have\nmade His position more explicit.  He didn't tell the centurion to leave the\narmy, for instance; and the NT is full of military metaphors.\n\n[B. On the pacifist side:]\n\n(1) Apparently many early Christians refused to fight in the Roman army,\nor stated that one should refuse if given a choice.  But it's not clear\nwhether they were objecting to war _per se_, or objecting to Roman policies.\n\n(2) In modern warfare, it seems to be impossible to direct attacks only at\ncombatants.  Bombing, both conventional and nuclear, kills lots of civilians.\n\n(3) It's hard to tell whether any _particular_ war is justified at the time.\nOften it takes decades for the requisite information to become available\nto the general public.\n\nPlease, NO EMAIL REPLIES -- this is meant as a contribution to a public\ndiscussion, and anyone wanting to reply should also reply publicly.
This brings up an interesting subject that has not been discussed much,\nand probably has not been studied much.\n\nAs some of you may be aware, I've posted a lot of articles lately on\npersonality typing (of which the MBTI is a test vehicle).  To come up\nto speed, just read 'alt.psychology.personality' and/or ask for by\npersonality type summary file.\n\nOne observation is that people have significantly different personalities\n(no question on this) which seem to be essentially in-born.  With respect\nto church attendance and participation, some people thrive on this, while\nother people have real difficulty with this because they prefer a more\nsolitary and contemplative lifestyle - that is, they are de-energized if\nconfronted with excessive closeness to outside activities and lots of\npeople.  Of course this is measured by extroversion/introversion.\n\nMy impression is that many churches are totally blind to this fact, and\ncreate environments that 'scare away' many who are naturally introverted\n(there are many introverted characters in the Bible, btw).  I know, I am\nquite introverted in preference, and find the 'pressure' by many churches\nto participate, to meet together in large groups, etc., to be very\nuncomfortable.  Knowing what I know now, these churches have been overly\ninfluenced by highly extroverted people who thrive on this sort of thing.\n(BTW, there's nothing wrong with either extroversion or introversion, both\npreferences have their place in the Body).\n\nMaybe I should define extrovert/introvert more carefully since these words\nare usually not used correctly in our culture.  The extrovert/introvert\nscale is a measure of how a person is energized.  The following is\nexcerpted from my summary:\n\n1.  Energizing - How a person is energized:\n\n        Extroversion (E)- Preference for drawing energy from the outside\n                          world of people, activities or things.\n\n        Introversion (I)- Preference for drawing energy from one's internal\n                          world of ideas, emotions, or impressions.\n\n\nHopefully this will elicit further discussion as to how churches can\nstructure themselves to meet the real needs of the people who comprise\nthe Body of Christ, instead of trying to change people's personalities\nto fit them into a particular framework.  I'm sure there are other aspects\nof how churches have not properly understood personality variances among\ntheir members to the detriment of all.\n\nJon Noring\n\n-- \n\nCharter Member --->>>  INFJ Club.

[remainder of message deleted]\n\nPardon me for replying to only a portion of your message :)\n\nThe reason we can say "God just exists" and can't say "The universe just \nexists" is because the universe is a natural realm and is subject to natural \nlaws in general and the law of cause and effect in particular.  That is, we \nobserve in nature that every cause has an effect, and every effect was produced \nby a cause.  The existence of the natural realm, as an effect itself, cannot be \nits own cause; it must therefore have a supernatural cause.\n\nGod, on the other hand, is a supernatural being, and is therefore not subject \nto such natural laws as the law of cause and effect.  As a supernatural being, \nGod's eternal existence does not imply a previous cause the way the existence \nof a physical, natural cosmos does.  Thus, those who believe in the \nsupernatural have a valid basis for accepting the existence of uncaused \nphenomena such as the eternal God, whereas those who deny the existence of the \nsupernatural are faced with the dilemma of a physical universe whose very \nnature shows that it is not sufficient to explain its own existence.\n\nThis is, of course, an oversimplification of a complex topic, but I just wanted \nto clarify some important differences between the supernatural (God) and the \nnatural (the universe), since you seem to mistake them as being \ninterchangeable.
...\n\n\nSeems to me if you learned to differentiate between illusion and\nreality on your own you wouldn't need to rely on doctrines that\nneed to be updated.  My experience of Christianity (25+ years) is\nthat most Christians seek answers from clergymen who have little\nor no direct experience of spiritual matters, and that most of\nthese questions can be answered by simple introspection.  Most\npeople suspect that they cannot trust their senses, but few take\nthe next step to figure out that they can trust themselves.  Not to\nget too esoteric, but it seems that most religions, Christianity\nincluded, are founded by particularly intuitive people who understand\nthis.\n\n(stuff deleted)\n\n\nAnd what if the original poster, Pixie, is never "converted?"\nDoes it make sense that she (or I, or the majority of humanity\nfor that matter) would go to hell for eternity, as many \nChristians believe?  It makes more sense to me that rather\nthan be converted to a centuries-old doctrine that holds no\nlife for her, that she simply continue to decide for herself\nwhat is best.  \n\n--------------------------------------------
John,\nThe problem here is that you have taken one peice of my response, without\nbothering to connect it with the other parts.  I have repeatedly noted that\none needs to take the problematic historcity of acts and then examine the\nwork of John Dominic Crossan and Burton Mack.  Once you have taken the time\nto examine recent developments in biblical scholarship, I think you will \ngrasp more clearly what I am saying.\n\n\n\n\nCertainly this is an issue as I think the situation in Waco shows most \nclearly.  If all that is required is that people are willing to die for a\nbelief for it to be true, then surely David Koresh is the son of God.  No,\nthe spurrious arguement that the resurrection had to be true for people to be\nwilling to die must be put to rest.  The other problem is that it is so \nmonologocentric.  Even if the resurrection was a big deal (which it doesn't\nseem to have been for either Q, Thomas, or even John to a certain degree)\nthere are a lot of other things which the Early Christians could have been\ndoing together that would have been worth dying for.  It is my belief that\neven the idea of a mixed race community, which brought down regional/national\nboundaries in the name of koinonia could have been enough for people to be\nwilling to die.  Radical communties do that (e.g. Jonestown, Waco, Warsaw, etc)\nBut my original point was that roman persecution (which is the only persecution\nwe have documented proof of) was not about whether a carpenter came back from\nthe dead.  Such a claim was not unique nor particularly abhorent to the roman\nor greek mind.  My point is that avoidance of military and civic duty (i.e.\nemperor worship) would have been much more problematic -- which has nothing\nto do with the resurrection at all.  When nero used christians as human \ntorches to light up his dinner party it wasn't because the believe in a \nrisen savior, it was because they were supposedly involved in incest and\ncannablism.  The argument that christians were martyred for the resurrection\njust cannot stand up to critical examination.
There seem to be many points to the speaking in tongues thing which\nare problematic.  It's use as prayer language seems especially troubling\nto me.  I understand that when you pray in tongues, the spirit is doing\nthe talking.  And when you pray, you pray to God.  And the Spirit is\nGod.  So, the Spirit is talking to Himself.  Which is why I only go\nby the Pentecost use where it's an actual language.\n\nMoreover, the phrase "though I speak with the tongues of men and angels"\nused by Paul in I Cor. is misleading out of context.   Some would then\nassume that there is some angelic tongue, and if when they speak, it\nis no KNOWN language, then it is an angelic tongue.\n\nHmmm...in the old testament story about the tower of Babel, we see how\nGod PUNISHED by giving us different language.  Can we assume then that\nif angels have their own language at all, that they have the SAME one\namongst other angels?  After all, THEY were not punished in any manner.\n\nSo why do these supposed angelic tongues all sound different FROM ONE\nANOTHER?  It's disturbing to think that some people find ways to \njustify jabbering.\n\nBut I'll buy the idea that someone could talk in a language never learned.\n\nTrouble is, while such stories abound, any and all attempts at\nverification (and we are to test the spirit...) either show that\nthe witness had no real idea of the circumstances, or that outright\nfabrication was involved.  The Brother Puka story in a previous post\nseems like a "friend of a friend" thing.  And linguistically, a two\nsyllable word hardly qualifies as language, inflection or no.
It's like refusing 'God's kingdom come'.\n\nIn one of Jesus' revelation in this century, "...same thing as in\nthe old days.  People refuse to believe my messengers.  Even when\nI was alive here on earth, they refuse Me.  What more when I am just\ntalking through somebody else?" (paraphrased).\n\nWith all the knowledge believers accumulated, He would think that\nwe would be 'enlightened' enough to detect which ones are \n'authentic and divine' as opposed to 'evil or man-made'.\n\nThese signs, these miracles, are you afraid that they are not from God?\nThat these are the signs we should not open our hearts and mind to for thinking\n  they are evil?\nWell, is faith in God evil?\nIs true peace evil?  Is true love that is divine and pure evil? \nWhy can't someone accept that God can do what He wants in fulfillment of His\n  generous love and Jesus' never ending forgiveness to those who turn back to\n  Him for salvation?\nWhy are we refusing God's messenger of this truth?  The mother to all who are\n  in Christ?\nWhat brings us these:\n    fears of being shamed by what others will think or say about us?\n        which, in contrary, could be pleasing to God?\n    fears of being humbled?\n    fears of being judged as wrong (wrt mainstream standard of what is right)?\nWhy can't we tolerate non-believers' mockery or ridicule of us for the\n  sake of peace, love and obedience to God?  The humbling lessons left to us\n  by martyrs and saints?\nWe'd rather engage in never-ending bickering and disproof of each other's\n  opinion - looking at each other's mistakes - for the sake of arguments,\n  instead of having communion in one body with Christ.\nWhat makes us go blind to the truth that God is All Powerful and that He can\n  not be binded by what people wrote and have written about Him in all ages?\nWhy is our faith in God limited?  By all the words and literature we muster?\nWhat prevents us from going *beyond* being saved and extend God's rich love\n  to others who are not?\n\nWhy are our eyes not wide open to see that He continuously sees our faith, hope\n  and love which glorify Him and so He gives us indications of His \n  acknowledgements with signs/miracles (ordinary/common or divinely inspired) \n  everywhere?  Isn't that like an atheist/agnostic's view that all these\n  are just ordinary here on earth and not caused by anything supernatural?\n\nWhy then does the Holy Mother comes back to remind us:\n  "We must really __accept that prayer__ changes the course of things and that\n  with prayers __even wars can be prevented__."\nbut then she continues:\n  "You often have an egotistic attitude.  Dear children, in these days you\n  have prayed very much, __but your hands have remained empty__."\nWhy hesitate in proclaiming what needs to be done:\n  "prayer, conversion, peace, penance, fasting, the Holy Mass, living life\n  as what the Gospel brings."?\nWhy not do so?  How?  To the world?\n  "Start in your family.  Be a good example.  Live the Word."\nWhy worry if it is going to be of good use to many?\n  "The fruits, __leave them to the Lord__, do not worry about anything or \n  anyone but entrust yourself to the Lord."\n\nAlthough the Holy Mother does not insist because:\n  "You are free; I bow before the freedom which God gives you."\nbut she follows this with:\n  "You are surprised because I say to you: Decide for God and yet, see how\n  you have lived this day."\nWhy does she constantly conveys:\n  "Take this life toward God in the way as to __experience__ the Lord Himself\n  in your __behavior__ and __not only__ when you pray" or one time when we \n  decide that we are saved, or talk/write about God, etc.\nThe Holy Mother warns:\n  "Satan (the serpent) is always trying to dissuade you to turn you away from\n  my peace plan and prayer."  (Rev 12:17, the dragon became angry with the woman\n  and went off to wage war against the rest of her offsprings, those who keep\n  God's commandments, and bear witness to Jesus.)\n\nDo you have fear or hate for God's current messenger of true peace, love and\n  our motherly protector from the anti-Christ?\nThe one who is being apprehensive of communism, wars, famine and other evils\n  that the serpent brings upon us? \nThis obedient and blessed new Eve?\nThe mother who warns us so we can be prepared and be strong against Satan?\nHaven't there been renewed faith, hope, love, peace and obedience wherever\n  this messenger has shared her blessings and graces that God has given her\n  in good purpose?\nWhy do we choose to be blind?\nWhy fear the truth that God has been giving us a chance and sharing Christ's\n  ever-forgetting forgiveness to us through the obedient mother?\nThe mother who has been consecrated the task __to reverse__ the disobedient\n  harm and example done by the ancient Eve.\nShe has been preparing the new Eden with her Immaculate Heart.\nThe new Eden as sanctuary (the womb) for the next coming and judgement of the \n  righteous by our Lord, Jesus Christ; when The Lamb marries His bride.\nShouldn't we give her a hand in her exhaustive job of preparing us for the\n  second coming of her Son as she has been conceived without sin to bear\n  the Son of God in her womb?\nWhy fear true peace, love and renewed faith and obedience to God that Mary\n  faithfully brings to God's children?  She has been protecting the flock\n  (the rest of the offsprings) from the greedy dragon so as to present more \n  righteous members for her Son's coming.\nNot all apparitions and miracles that resulted from them are worthy\n  of belief.  With prayer and guidance from the Holy Spirit and, of course,\n  approval of our Church authorities, we should be aware of the true and\n  divinely inspired ones; specifically, the ones which aligns with the\n  Scripture.\n  \n\nAlso, our Lady reminds us of recommendation of __silence__ in our prayers:\n  "If you speak unceasingly in your prayers, how will you be able to hear\n  God?  Allow Him room to answer you, to speak to you." \n\nShe encourages us (with motherly nurturing) to continue in exuberant \nfaith, hope and love to Jesus, constantly.  NOT with mere emotions, \nbut with deep, constant obedience to Jesus, her Beloved Son and\nacknowledgement of our need to have Him as part of our lives.\n\nLet's not wait to the last minute to renew our faith and the life\nthat God wants us to live; when there won't be enough time or when\nit will be late.\n                                                      \nNowadays, Mary says, \n"Pray, pray, pray for peace...reconciliation, my children."\nHave peace within yourself first before you can promote peace to\nothers.  For without peace, you can not fully accept my Son."\n                                                                       \n\nAnd you think she's just an ordinary lady.  Not to me.  She's\nour good Mother/messenger from God and she is so nice enough to\nshare God's kingdom to us through her Son and experience it.\n\nWith Mary, we are assured that The Lamb always succeeds.\n\n-----\nNote:  All enclosed in quotes are from "Latest News of Medjugorje"\n       Number 10, June, 1991 by Fr.

how can >this possibly be fair to the infants?\n\nWhat do you mean fair?  God is just, giving to everyone what they\ndeserve. As all infants are in sin from the time of conception (cf\nRomans 5.12, Psalm 1.7), they cannot possibly merit heaven, and as\npurgatory is for the purging of temporal punishment and venial sins, it\nis impossible that origianl sin can be forgiven.  Hence, the unbaptized\ninfants are cut off from the God against whom they, with the whole of\nthe human race except Mary, have sinned.  Which is why Jesus said,\n"Truly, truly I say to you, no one can enter the Kingdom of God unless\nhe is born of water and Spirit" which is the true meaning of born again\n(John 3.5).  Thus, as infants are in sin, it is very fair for them to be\ncut off from God and exlcuded from heaven.\n\nAs St. Augustine said, "I did not invent original sin, which the\nCatholic faith holds from ancient time; but you, who deny it, without a\ndoubt are a follower of a new heresy."  (De nuptiis, lib. 11.c.12)
Ah, double-fulfillment.  First of all I would say that I'm not sure all\nthe prophecies had double-fulfillment, e.g., the Isaiah 7:14 prophecy.\n\nI would say that just because this happens on some occasions does not mean\nit will occur always, especially with regard to NT prophecies. The apostles\nwho quoted the OT and applied those passages to Jesus were acting as divine\nmessengers and giving the inerrant Word of God to the Church.  No one has\nthat authority today.  No one has the apostolic authority to say that\nsuch-and-such a prophecy has double-fulfillment.  If the imagry of\nRevelation fits with events of the 1st century, it is folly for us to try\nand make it apply to events 20 centuries later.
I used to be a marriage commissioner for the Alaska Court\nSystem (sort of a justice of the peace).  I had great difficulty\nwith that duty.  I used to pray earnestly in the courthouse\nbathroom before the ceremonies, mostly asking that the couples\nwould come to appreciate and fulfill the true holiness and\ndivine purpose in marriage--couples who obviously didn't realize\nthat marriage is God's institution, not the state's.  Gradually,\nhowever, I came to conclude that because I was acting in a\nstrictly secular, public capacity, established as such by both\nthe state and the expectations of the couples involved, I was\nreally conducting a purely secular, legal civil event, with no\ngreater moral or religious implications than if I had been\nconducting a civil trial (the couple who told me, mid-ceremony,\nto "please hurry it up" may have helped me to this conclusion). \n\n     I thought I had neatly rationalized a clear and sharp\ndistinction between marriage before God, and "marriage" before\nthe state, until I had to deal with my own divorce.  Keeping\nMatthew 19:6 in mind, I felt that the state had no business\ndissolving my marriage established before God, but of course it\nassumed jurisdiction nonetheless.  \n\n      I would ask those of you proposing answers to this\nquestion to consider this issue's logical extension: If\nintercourse, or the mental intent of the parties, or the\nceremony of the church, or any combination thereof, establishes\nmarriage, then at what moment is it dissolved?
Here's how I talk to non-Christians who are complaining about Hell.\n\nME:	"Do you believe you're going to Heaven?"\nHIM:	"I don't believe in Heaven."\nME:	"So are you going there?"\nHIM:	"If there was a heaven, I would."\nME:	"But since there isn't a Heaven, you're not going there, are you?"\nHIM:	"No."\n\n  The point is that Heaven is based on faith--if you don't believe in heaven,\nthere's no way you're going to be in it.\n  Of course, the next step is, "I don't believe in Hell either, so why will I\nbe there?"  It seems to me that Hell is eternal death and seperation from God.\nMost atheists do believe that when they die they will die forever, and never\nsee God--so they do, in fact, believe that they're going to Hell.\n  Hell doesn't have to be worse than earth to be Hell--because it's eternal, \nand it's a lot worse than Heaven.  That's the only comparison that matters.
[Stuff deleted]\n \n\n\nWill, there has been a lot of discussion going on about this over in\ns.r.c.b-s.\nI will make the case here though and try to help you out:\n\n8 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it\nis the gift of God:\n9 Not of works, lest any man should boast.\n(Ephesians 2:8-9).\n\nYes, it is by God's grace and our faith that we are saved.  We are not\nsaved by what we do.  However,\n\n15 If ye love me, keep my commandments.\n(John 14:15).\n\nKeeping Christ's commandments is a "work" per se, and a demonstration of\nour love for him.  Also,\n\n6 He spake also this parable; A certain man had a fig tree planted in his\nvineyard; and he came and sought fruit thereon, and found none.\n7 Then said he unto the dresser of his vineyard, Behold, these three years\nI come seeking fruit on this fig tree, and find none: cut it down; why\ncumbereth it the ground?\n8 And he answering said unto him, Lord, let it alone this year also, till I\nshall dig about it, and dung it:\n9 And if it bear fruit, well: and if not, then after that thou shalt cut it\ndown.\n(Luke 13:6-9).\n\nAgain,\n\n16 Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you, that ye\nshould go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain: that\nwhatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you.\n(John 15:16).\n\nIt is clear from these verses that we are called to bring forth fruit. \nWhat is that fruit.  Well, Paul speaks of the fruit of the spirit being\nlove, joy, peace, patience, etc.  All of these are things that are manifest\nin the actions that we carry out.\n\nIf a person claims to believe in Jesus Christ, but does not do the things\nChrist commanded, I dare say, that they really don't have any faith. \nAsking which is more important, faith or works, is like asking which blade\non a pair of scissors is most important or like asking which leg of your\npants is more important.\n\nGood works should come out of and be a result of our faith.  To have faith,\ntrue faith in Christ requires you to do what he commands.  The parable\nabove speaks allegorically of a person who does bear no fruit.  Christs\ncommands are actions, and if we don't do those actions and produce fruit,\nthen we shall be uprooted just like the tree. \n\nIt is a dead and useless faith which has no action behind it.  Actions\nprove our faith and show the genuineness of it.  I can sit and talk for\ndays about the fact that I have so much faith in my ability to jump off a\nbuilding and not hit the ground.  In other words, I can sit and tell you\nall day long that I have faith in my ability to fly.  I really don't have\nthat faith though unless I am willing to jump off the roof and take the\ntest.  Words and talk mean nothing.\n\nI could go on and give more scriptures and if people want me to I will, but\nthis should be sufficient.\n\nHope it helped.\n\nJon\n\n----------------\nsig file broken....\n\nplease try later...
Despite my trendy, liberal, feminist tendencies and the fact\nthat I basically agree with what you are saying I will rebut:\n\n \nThe basic question here is "how do I know what I am supposed to do?"\nThis is true in every situation that comes up. Some people do not\nthink about it at all and merely follow their impulses. I claim\nthat is just as dangerous as "following authority". I could site\nsexually transmitted diseases, drug abuse, all manner of criminal\nactivity, the savings and loan scandal, car accidents, eggs thrown\nat my house, all are examples of people not "following authority".\nI could easily argue that in the evil examples you gave the \nproblem was a leader not following _his_ authority and doing what \nhe wanted. Of course, where is the top of the chain? Therein lies \nour search.\n \n\nI don't think it's as simple as you are claiming. "Pressing need" is\nambiguous. Should I recycle or not? \n \nRealize that I have four kids who, despite being very precocious \nof course, are very tiring with their constant lack of understanding\nthe tremendous knowledge I wish to impart to them.\n\n\nAhh! An ironic ending.\n \nThe irony I was implying in my initial pithy retort to the bumper \nsticker cliche "Question Authority" was that I was questioning \nthe authority of the person telling me to question authority.\nIt seems there is a certain segment of society that finds meaning\nonly in being different, only in rebelling, forsaking everything\nfor the sake of freedom. I question their integrity and fortitude. \nThere is another freedom that comes from doing a task correctly.\nDifferent people are at different levels of development in different\nareas. Part of the challenge of life is to find the right authorities\nto follow, we can't know everything about everything. Often \nwhen learning a new skill or subject I will follow the teacher,\nperhaps blindly. Only when I have learned enough to ask appropriate\nquestions should I question him, only when I have developed\nmy skills enough should I challenge him. Once again, how do I know\nwhen I get to those stages?\n\nIf you have to be told to question authority, perhaps you shouldn't.
Michael Bushnell writes;\n\n\nWhich is exactly what I pointed out.  (Though I was wrong about your use\nof the Creed, the 1913 Catholic Encylcopedia in which I read about it\nsaid the Orthodox do use the Creed minus the filioque.  Apparently that\nhas changed.)  The Athanasian Creed has always had the Filioque, the\nNicene - Constantinopolitan did not.\n	Of course the Orthodox did not delete the Filioque from the Nicene\nCreed (it wasn't there to begin with), but they certainly did from the\nAthanasian Creed, which did have it from the beginning.\n	I might point out that the whole problem started over the difference in\nways of explaining the generation of the Blessed Trinity, the East\nemphasizing the idea of the Holy Spirit proceeding from the Father\nthrough the Son, and the West using proceeding from the Father and the\nSon.  In fact, some, such as Tertullian, used both formulations (see\nbelow)\n\n	"Following, therefore, the form of these examples, I profess that I do\ncall God and His Word, - the Father and and His Son, - two.  For the\nroot and the stem are two things, but conjoined; the fountain and the\nriver are two kinds, but indivisible; the sun and the ray are two forms,\nbut coherent ones.  Anything which proceeds from another must\nnecessarily be a second to that from which it proceeds; but it is not on\nthat account separated from it.  Where there is second, however, there\nare two; and where ther is third, there are three.  The Spirit, then, is\nthird from God and the Son, just as the third from the root is the fruit\nof the stem, and third from the fountain is the stream from the river,\nand thrid from the sun is the apex of the ray."\n	-Tertullian, Against Praxeas, 8, 5 (about 213 AD)\n\nand\n\n	"I believe that the Spirit proceeds not otherwise than from the Father\nthrough the Son"\n	-Tertullian, Against Praxeas, 4, 1 (about 213 AD)\n\nAnd as St. Thomas showed in his Summa Theologica Part 1, Question 36,\nArticles 2 and 3, there is no contradiction between the two methods of\ngeneration, and in fact, the two methods of reckoning the procession\nemphasize what St. Augustine, among others taught, that the Holy Spirit\nproceeds from the Father and the Son, but He proceeds from the Father in\na more preeminent way.\n\n	"For whatever the Son has, He has from the Father, certainly He has it\nfrom the Father that the Holy Spirit proceeds from Him ... For the\nFather alone is not from another, for which reason He alone is called\nunbegotten, not, indeed, in the Scriptures, but in the practice of\ntheologians, and of those who employ such terms as they are able in a\nmatter so great.  The Son, however, is born of the Father; and the Holy\nSpirit proceeds principally from the Father, and since the Father gives\nto the Son all that He has without any interval of time, the Holy Spirit\nproceeds jointly from both Father and Son.  He would be called Son of\nthe Father and of the Son if, which is abhorent to everyone of sound\nmind, they had both begotten Him.  The Spirit was not begotten by each,\nhowever, but proceeds from each and both."\n	-St. Augustine of Hippo, The Trinity, 15, 26, 47 (400 to 416 AD)\n\nSo, in a sense, all of the formulations are correct (to the West at\nleast), because the Holy Spirit proceeds from both Father and Son, but\nin proceeding from the Son, the orgin of that procession is the\nprocession from the Father, so the Holy Spirit is proceeding from the\nFather through the Son, but as all that the Son has is from the Father,\nthe Holy Spirit can be said to proceed from the Father, without any\nmention of the Son being necessary.\n	In any case, I am happy to know that I follow in the beliefs of Pope\nSt. Leo I, St. Fulgence of Ruspe, St. Cyril of Alexandria, Pope St.\nDamsus I, St. Augustine of Hippo, St. Epiphanius of Salamis, St. Ambrose\nof Milan, St. Hilary of Poitiers, Tertullian, and others among the\nFathers, who all have very quotable quotes supporting the Catholic\nposition, which I enunciated above.\n	As for the issue of the adoption of another Creed being forbidden, I\nwill point out that the Holy Fathers of Ephesus and Chalcedon both spoke\nof the Creed of Nicea in their statement forbidding anyone "to produce,\nwrite, or compose a confession of faith other than the one defined by\nthe Fathers of Nicea."  That Creed is a different Creed than that of\nConstantinople, which is commonly called the Nicene Creed.  Not of\ncourse in that they were condemning the adoption of the\nConstantinopolitan Creed, which is but an enlargement upon the Creed of\nNicea, but that they were condemning the impious opinions of Nestorious,\nwho had adopted a radically different Creed from the one used by the\nChurch, which among other things denied the procession of the Holy\nSpirit form the Son.  Thus, the additions of the Constantinopolitan\nCreed were not thought to be in violation of this, and as the Council\nChalcedon also affirmed the doctrine of the procession of the Holy\nSpirit from the Son, which Nestorius denied, they could hardly have been\nagainst explaining in a fuller way the Creed, for they themselves\napproved of previous additions to it.  And if the further explanations\nof the Creed made in Constantinople were not denigrating of the work\ndone by the Holy Fathers of Nicea or in any way heretical, it follows\nthat the Council of Toledo was fully able to add what was not disputed\nby the faithful to the Creed so as to combat the impieties of the Arians\nin Spain, because the filioque was not in dispute in the Church until\nmany years later under Photius and others.  And that the filioque was\nnot disputed, I provide more quotes below.\n\n	"Since the Holy Spirit when he is in us effects our being conformed to\nGod, and he actually proceeds from the Father and Son, it is abundantly\nclear that He is of the divine essence, in it in essence and proceeding\nfrom it."\n	-St. Cyril of Alexandria, The Treasury of the Holy and Consubstantial\nTrinity, Thesis 34, (423-425 AD)\n\n	"The Holy Spirit is not of the Father only, or of the Son only, but he\nis the Spirit of the Father and the Son.  For it is written: `If anyone\nloves the world, the Spirit of the Father is not in him'; and again it\nis written: `If anyone, however, does not have the Spirit of Christ, he\nis none of His.'  When the Father and the Son are named in this way, the\nHoly Spirit is understood, of whom the Son himself says in the Gospel,\nthat the Holy Spirit `proceeds from the Father,' and that `He shall\nreceive of mine and shall announce it to you.'"\n	-Pope St. Damasus I, The Decree of Damasus, 1 (382 AD)\n\n	"The only-begotten Holy Spirit has neither the name of the Son nor the\nappelation of Father, but is called Holy Spirit, and is not foreign to\nthe Father.  For the Only-begotten Himself calls Him: `the Spirit of the\nFather,' and says of Him the `He proceeds from the Father,' and `will\nreceive of mine,' so that He is reckoned as not being foreign to the\nSon, but is of their same substance, of the same Godhead; He is Spirit\ndivine, ... of God, and He is God.  For he is Spirit of God, Spirit of\nthe Father, and Spirit of the Son, not by some kind of synthesis, like\nsoul and body in us, but in the midst of Father and Son of the Father\nand of the Son, a third by appelation....\n	"The Father always existed and the Son always existed, and the Spirit\nbreathes from the Father and the Son; and neither is the Son created nor\nis the Spirit created."\n	-St. Epiphanius of Salamis (which is on Cyprus), The Man Well-Anchored,\n8 and 75 (374 AD)\n\n	"Concerning the Holy Spirit, I ought not to remain silent, nor yet is\nit necessary to speak.  Still, on account of those who do not know Him,\nit is not possible for me to be silent.  However it is necessary to\nspeak of Him who must be acknowledged, who is from the Father and the\nSon, His Sources."\n	-St. Hilary of Poitiers, The Trintiy, 2, 29 (356 to 359 AD)\n\n	Thus, as I have pointed out before, Gaul, Spain, Italy, Africa, Egypt,\nPalastine, and the lands of the Greeks, all of Christnedom at that time,\nall have Fathers who can be cited to show that they confess the doctrine\nexpressed by the filioque.  I suggest to those of the Orthodox Church\nthat they come up with some of the Fathers, besides St. John of Damascus\nwho all will admit denied the filioque, to support their views.  It is\nnot enough to bring up the "proceeds from the Father" line of the Creed\nor the Gospel of John, for that says what we believe also.  But it does\nnot say the Holy Spirit does not proceed from the Son, only that He does\nproceed from the Father.
You assume this because you believe in a designing creator,\nand you observe our ability to procreate...\n\n\n.... But then you observe our ability to modify fertility\nthrough intelligence & experiment, and draw no similar conclusions\nabout God designing us for scientific inquiry & the use of the\ntechnology that it produces.  How is it that one ability is "obviously\nfrom God", and the other not?\n\n\nI want to know the truth, and hold the Truth as the most\nbasic of all ethical values, because correct moral judgement\nrelies on knowing the truth, not vice versa. Moralities that\nassert that assent to a belief is a moral choice, and not\ncompelled by evidence inevitably cut off the limb they sit upon.\nFalsification of evidence, conscious and unconscious, follows\ncorrupting both the intellect and the heart.\n\n\nIf there is a God, he has nothing to fear from truth.\nAs to imaginary gods and there followers: Be afraid. Be very\nafraid.
Note that I said the fall of Rome, not of the Empire.  The Roman Empire\nlasted until 1453, with its transfered capital in Constantinople.  The\nmain reason for it's fall was not so much the sack of Constantinople by\nthe men of the 4th Crusade (who were not Christians - they had been\nexcommunicated down to the last man after attacking the Christian city\nof Zara in Croatia), but rather the disastorous defeat in the battle of\nMazinkert.  After the Turks breached the frontier, it was only a matter\nof time before the Empire fell, the inability of the Empire to hold onto\nthe rim of Anatolia, with the Ottomans and Rum Seljuks in the middle\nshould be quite obvious to any student of history.  The sack of\nConstantinople only hastened the inevitable along.  For if the Greeks\nhad wanted to save their empire, why would they not cooperate with the\nCrusaders when they came to do battle with the Saracens in the 1st-3rd\nCrusades?  Because of their obstinacy over cooperating with people they\nconsidered heretics, even though those "heretics" were fighting for the\ncause of the Empire and Christendom in doing battle with the Turkish\nhordes in Anatolia, Edessa, Lebanon, Palastine, and Syria, the some\nhordes who were to later sack Constantinople, and overrun a third of\nEurope (the Balkans, Hungary, the Ukraine, the Caucasus, etc.)

My brother has been alienated from my parents and me since shortly after\nhis marriage to a domineering and insecure woman, about twelve years ago.\nWe've kept things on a painfully polite, Christmas-card sort of level\nfor most of this time. Attempts to see each other end disastrously, with\nhis wife throwing a screaming fit and storming out over either our imagined\nslights to her, or his inattention or insensitivity to her (I mean, this'll\nhappen by the end of a single restaurant meal). He seems, from what I've\nseen, to live in a state of quivering anxiety, hoping futilely to keep\nthe next storm from breaking. He has sacrificed not only meaningful contact\nwith us but also other friends and outside interests. Now, this is his\nchoice, and I need to accept it even if I deplore it. But it's hard.\n   From time to time I've wanted to drop the pretense that we have a\nrelationship--by cutting off contact--or trying to have a real if painful\nrelationship, by talking honestly with him, but I've always thought, "Why\nbe dramatic? And you know he'll only get evasive and then find some excuse\nto get off the phone. Just leave the door open, in case he ever decides to\ncome back." It's been an unsatisfying choice, to allow us to go on\nwith the superficial trappings of a relationship, but it was the best I\ncould think of.\n   Now, this weekend, my mother finally decided that she wasn't going\nto pretend any more and has cut off relations with them. This was the\noutcome of a phone conversation in which my sister-in-law screamed and\nraved at my mother, blaming her for everything wrong in their lives, and\nin which my brother evaded, temporized, claimed the situation was\nbeyond his control, and as always expected my mother to make all the\nallowances and concessions. Mom said she would not, that she would not\nquietly take abuse any more, and that if these were the terms of their\nrelationship, she didn't want to talk to or see them any more. And she hung\nup. (I have never seem my mother lose her temper, and I think that this is\nthe first time she's ever hung up on someone.) Mom says she feels as if\nshe's divorced my brother, and that it's a relief in some ways to have the\nbreak out in the open and done with.\n \n    I have mixed feelings. I'm proud of Mom for sticking up for herself;\nangry at my brother and sister-in-law for hurting her, for being jerks, for\npersisting in such a wretched life, which hurts us all and is warping their\nchildren; angry at my sister-in-law for being so hateful, and angry at my\nbrother for being a coward and having so little respect for himself or us\nthat he's willing to throw us aside and use up all his energy trying to\nappease an unappeasable,\nemotionally disturbed woman; pained for their children, who are a mess;\nscared for the future, since this marks the time when either things will\nchange and improve or the break will become irrevocable; nastily self-\nrighteous over this bit of proof that they can't "get away" with treating\nus or each other this way, and then disgusted with myself for even\nbeginning to gloat over others' misery; and finally, mostly, sad, sad,\nsad, to see my parents hurt and my brother and sister-in-law trapped in\na horrible, destructive situation that they can't see a way out of--or\nthey can't bear to take whatever paths they do see. And I'm frustrated\nbecause I don't know what if anything to do, and doing nothing drives me\nup the wall. I try to pray, about my own feelings of rage, impotence,\nand vindictiveness, and about their situation, but I am not\nfree of the desire to *DO* something concrete. (The desire to *DO*\nsomething, to define a problem and fix it, is one of my besetting\nvices; I'm having a terrible time quieting down my internal\nmental chatter enough to listen for God.)\n  Do you thoughtful and kind people on the net have advice for me? Is\nthis a time to reach out to my brother? To let things be? How can I\nconquer my rage AT him enough to be there FOR him?\n \nHere's the big question I've been evading throughout this long, long\npost: Is it ok, as a Christian and a proponent of faith, hope, and\ncharity, to accept the destruction of a relationship? To give up on\nmy own brother, or at least to accept that I am powerless to help him\nand can only wait and see what happens? Do please answer--by e-mail or\npost.\n \nThank you.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nSo you believe in the existance of One creator I assume.\n\n\n\nOk, god has the disclaimer, reserves the right to judge individual\ncases.  If we believe him to be loving, then we also believe him to be\nable to serve justice to all.  Don't worry if a Jew, or athiest is\ngoing to heaven or hell, for that is god to judge (although truly\nif you were concerned you could only worry abput those who refuse to\nbelieve/satisfy gods decrees) as much as keeping yourself straight.\nIf you see something going on that is wrong, discuss it and explore it\nbefore making summary judgement.  People have enough free will to choose\nfor themselves, so don't force choices on them, just inform them\nof what they're choices are.  God will take care of the rest in his justice.
Oh contrer mon captitan!  There is a way.  Certainly it is not by human reason.\n Certainly it is not by human experience. (and yet it is both!)  To paraphrase\nSartre, the particular is absurd unless it has an infinite reference point.  It\nis only because of God's own revelation that we can be absolute about a thing. \nYour logic comes to fruition in relativism.  \n\nAh, now it is clear.  Ludwig was a desciple of Russell. Ludwig's fame is often\nexplained by the fact that he spawned not one but two significant movements in\ncontemporary philosophy. Both revolve around Tractatus Logico-Philosphicus\n('21) and Philosophical Investigation ('53).  Many of Witt's comments and\nimplicit conclusions suggest ways of going beyond the explicit critique of\nlanguage he offers.  According to some of the implicit suggestions of Witt's\nthought, ordinary language is an invaluable resource, offering a necessary\nframework for the conduct of daily life.  However, though its formal features\nremain the same, its content does not and it is always capable of being\ntranscended as our experience changes and our understanding is deepened, giving\nus a clearer picture of what we are and what we wish to say.  On Witt's own\naccount, there is a dynamic fluidity of language.   It is for this reason that\nany critique of language must move from talking about the limits of language to\ntalking about its boundaries, where a boundary is understood not as a wall but\na threshold.\n  vonWrights's comment that Witt's "sentences have a content that often lies\ndeep beneath the surface of language."  On the surface, Witt talks of the\ninsuperable position of ordinary language and the necessity of bringing\nourselves to accept it without question.  At the same time, we are faced with\nWitt's own creative uses of language and his concern for bringing about changes\nin our traditional modes of understanding.  Philosophy, then, through more\nperspicacious speech, seeks to effect this unity rather than assuming that it\nis already functioning. Yes?  The most brilliant of scientists are unable to\noffer a foundation for human speech so long as they reject Christianity! In his\nTractatus we have the well nigh perfect exhibition of the nature of the impasse\nof the scientific ideal of exhaustive logical analysis of Reality by man. \nPerfect language does not exist for fallen man, therefore we must get on about\nour buisness of relating Truth via ordinary language.\n\n  This is why John's Gospel is so dear to most Christians.  It is so simple in\nit conveyance of the revealation of God, yet so full of unlieing depth of\nunderstanding.  He viewed Christ from the OT concept of "as a man thinketh, so\nhe is."  John looked at the outward as only an indicator of what was inside,\nthat is the consciousness of Christ.  And so must we.  Words are only vehicals\nof truth.  He is truth.  The scriptures are plain in their expounding that\nthere is a Truth and that it is knowable.  THere are absolutes, and they too\nare knowable.  However, they are only knowable when He reveals them to the\nindividual.  There is, and we shouldn't shy from this, a mysticism to\nChristianity.  Paul in ROm 8 says there are 3 men in the world.  There is the\none who does not have the Spirit and therefore can not know the things of the\nSpirit (the Spirit of Truth) and there is the one who has the Spirit and has\nthe capacity to know of the Truth, but there  is the third.  THe one who not\nonly has the Spirit, but that the Spirit has him! Who can know the deep things\nof God and reveal them to us other than the Spirit.  And it is only the deep\nthings of GOd that are absolute and true.\n   There is such a thing as true truth and it is real, it can be experienced\nand it is verifiable.  I disagree with Dr Nancy's Sweetie's conclusion because\nif it is taken to fruition it leads to relativism which leads to dispair.  \n\n"I would know the words which He would answer me, and understand what He would\nsay unto me."

Whether there is a "why" or not we have to find it. This is Pascal's(?) wager.\nIf there is no why and we spend our lives searching, then we have merely\nwasted our lives, which were meaningless anyway. If there is a why and we\ndon't search for it, then we have wasted our potentially meaningful lives.\nSuppose the universe is 5 billion years old, and suppose it lasts another\n5 billion years. Suppose I live to be 100. That is nothing, that is so small\nthat it is scary. So by searching for the "why" along with my friends here\non earth if nothing else we aren't so scared.\n\nWhat if you woke up at a party, with no memory, and everyone was discussing\nwho the host might be? There might not be a host, you say. I say let's go\nfind him, the party's going to be over sometime, maybe he'll let us stay.\n\nBecause we recognize our own mortality we have to find the "why".\n\n\nThis is a good point. But more of a good point for studying religion\nthan ignoring it. Some Christians disagree with me, but it is worthwhile\nto study different religions and philosophies and glean the truth from\nthem. To quote (of course out of context) "Test everything and keep what is\ntrue."
There was an article on clari.news.religion in the last few days about a\nPolish tribunal decision. It said that crucifixes and religious classes in\npublic schools were okay; and that children who did not want to take religion\nclass could not be forced to take an ethics class as a substitute.

.\n	.\n	.\n\nWhy do you assume that Jesus's plea to His Father "to let this cup\npass from Him", was merely a plea to escape death?  When I look at\nJesus in the garden, I see a Man-God, who all His life had had the\npresense of His Father with Him.  As a result, He knew every\ndetail about His death long before the Agony in the Garden.  But\nas that hour approached, He felt abandoned by His Father, His\npresense diminishing with each passing minute.  In addition, it\nwas brought more and more to Jesus's attention (the betrayal of\nJudas was probably a big impact) that His suffering would be to no\navail for many people, especially those who would reject Him, not\nonly then but in the future.  I truly believe that the majority of\nJesus's suffering was mental and spiritual, while the physical\nportion was only the tip of the iceburg.\n\nBTW, we know from John's account that Jesus *shunned* becomming an earthly\nking.  From John:\n\nJOH 6:14    After the people saw the miraculous sign that Jesus did, they\n            began to say, "Surely this is the Prophet who is to come into the\n            world."\nJOH 6:15    Jesus, knowing that they intended to come and make him king by\n            force, withdrew again to a mountain by himself.\n\nThis does not seem like a man who would regret not becoming an\nearthly king.  No, Jesus knew His mission was to redeem all (Jew &\nGentile) people and establish His kingdom in the hearts of those\nwho would believe.  This was utterly mistaken, much to Jesus's\ndismay, as an aspiration to some earthly kingdom.  But He knew\nwhat His Father's will was and followed it obediently even in the\ndarkness of His Passion.
First of all, I resent your assumption that you know why I\nam threatened by science, or even that I am threatened at all,\nalthough I admit the latter.  The reason I am threatened by Science\nhas nothing to do with my need for proof of my Lord's existence--\nGod reveals Himself in many ways, including, to some degree,\nScience.\n\n	My problem with Science is that often it allows us to\nassume we know what is best for ourselves.  God endowed us\nwith the ability to produce life through sexual relations,\nfor example, but He did not make that availible to everyone.\nDoes that mean that if Science can over-ride God's decision\nthrough alterations, that God wills for us to have the power\nto decide who should and should not be able to have \nchildren?  Should men be allowed to have babies, if that\nis made possible.\n\n	People have always had the ability to end lives\nunnaturally, and soon may have the ability to bring lives\ninto the world unnaturally.  The closest thing to artificially\ncreated life is artificially created death, and as God\nhas reserved judgement about when people should die to\nHimself, I believe we should rely on God's wisdom about how\npeople should be brought in to the world.\n\n	This is not to say that I reject all forms of\nmedical treatment, however.  Treatment that alleviates\npain, or prevents pain from occuring, is perfectly\nacceptable, I believe, as it was acceptable for Jesus\nto cure the sick.  However, treatment that merely \nprolongs life for no reason, or makes unnecessary \nalterations to the body for mere aesthetic purposes,  \ngo too far.  Are we not happy with the beauty God\ngave us?\n\n	I cannot draw a solid line regarding where I\nwould approve of Scientific study, and where I would not,\nbut I will say this:  Before one experiments with the\nuniverse to find out all its secrets, one should ask\nwhy they want this knowledge.  Before one alters the body\nthey have been given, they should ask themseles why their\nbody is not satisfactory too them as it is.  I cannot\nmake any general rules that will cover all the cases, but\nI will say that each person should pray for guidance\nwhen trying to unravel the mysteries of the universe, and\nshould cease their unravelling if they have reason to \nbelieve their search is displeasing to God.
Pardon me, a humble atheist, but exactly what is the difference\nbetween holding a revealed truth with blind faith as its basis (i.e.\nregardless of any evidence that you may find to the contrary) as an\nabsolute truth, fully expecting people to believe you and arrogance?\n\n     They sound like one and the same to me.\n\n     And nearly every time I meet a christian (or for that matter, any\nother theist) who tries to convert me, I find this proven over and over\nagain.\n\n     I see no wisdom whatsoever in your words\n\n\n                                       Unfaithfully yours,\n\n                                       Pixie\n\n\n     p.s.  If you do sincerely believe that a god exists, why do you follow\nit blindly?  \n\n     Do the words "Question Authority" mean anything to you?
An interesting interpretation of Revelation 17 and 18 has been given by  \nevangelist David Wilkerson.  I am not saying that I totally agree with his  \ninterpretation, but it is certainly believable and good food for thought.  He  \ninterprets the Babylon of Revelation 17-18 as being none other than the good  \nold U. S. of A.  That's right, America.  He supports his claim in several ways.   \nThe Babylon of Revelation is THE world leader in trade and commerce, and the  \nWHOLE WORLD wept when Babylon fell.  The American dollar, despite the Japanese  \nsuccess of the 20th century, is STILL the most sought after currency in the  \nworld.  If the U.S. were destroyed, wouldn't the whole world mourn?  The bible  \nalso talks about Babylon being a home of harlots, sin, and adultery (I am  \nparaphrasing, of course).  Babylon's sin affected, or should I say, infected,  \nthe whole world.  It doesn't take much looking to see that the U.S. is in a  \nstate of moral decay.  Hasn't the American culture and Hollywood spread the "do  \nit if it feels good" mentality all over the world.  I think, though, that what  \nMr. Wilkerson uses as his strongest argument is the fact that Revelation calls  \nBabylon "Babylon the Great" and portrays it as the most powerful nation on  \nearth.  No matter how dissatisfied you are with the state of our country, I  \ndon't think you would have too much trouble agreeing that the U.S. is STILL the  \nmost powerful nation on earth.\n\nAgain, this interpretation is not NECESSARILY my own, but I do find it worthy  \nof consideration.
Did this happen to Jesus? I don't think so, not from what I heard. He lived\nONE DAY of suffering and died. If the wages of sin is the above paragraph, then\nJESUS DIDN'T PAY FOR OUR SINS, DID HE?\n\nI'd be surprised to see the moderator let this one through, but I seriously\nwant a reasonable explanation for this.
May I suggest the book: "Ethics" by Dr. Norm Geisler, of Dallas Theological\nSeminary.  In it, he goes over all the arguments pro and con and in-between,\nand comes up with a very reasonable answer.  If I have time, and there is\nenough interest, I may post his position.\n\nJon Noring\n\n-- \n\nCharter Member --->>>  INFJ Club.
In 12-step programs (like Alcoholics Anonymous), one of the steps\ninvolves acknowleding a "higher power".  AA and other 12-step abuse-\nrecovery programs are acknowledged as being among the most effective.\n\nUnfortunately, as evidence for God, this can be dismissed by stating\nthat the same defect of personality makes substance abusers as makes \npeople 'religious', and the debunker could perhaps acknowledge that\nbeing religious is a better crutch than being a drug addict, but\nstill maintain that both are escapism.  (And I suspect that there\nare some atheists who would find the substance abuse preferable to\nChristianity.)\n\nI think that an essential problem with communication between Christ-\nians and atheists is that as Christians we necessarily see ourselves\nas incomplete, and needing God (the 'God-shaped hole'), while atheists\nnecessarily see themselves as self-sufficient.  If the atheists are\nright, Christians are guilty of being morally weak, and too cowardly\nto stand up for themselves; if the Christians are right, the atheists\nare guilty of considerable arrogance.  (I use the term atheist to\nrefer to a person who has a definite conviction that there is no God,\nas opposed to one who does not know and/or does not care about God.)\n==\nSeanna Watson   Bell-Northern Research,       | Pray that at the end of living,\n(seanna@bnr.ca) Ottawa, Ontario, Canada       | Of philosophies and creeds,\n                                              | God will find his people busy\nOpinion, what opinions?

In <Apr.10.05.30.16.1993.14313@athos.rutgers.edu>\n\n\n[ . . . ]\n\nHaving lived through the kicking and screaming in the 60s and 70s as the\nCatholics were invited to participate in the liturgy instead of counting\ntheir rosary beads during Mass, I find this comment interesting.  There\nis a _massively_ longer tradition for proclaiming the Passion accounts\nwithout active participation.  If you know the Latin, one really\nbeautiful way to hear the Passion is it's being chanted by three\ndeacons:  the Narrator chants in the middle baritone range, Jesus chants\nin the bass, and others directly quoted are handled by a high tenor.\nThis is actually the basis for the common proclamation of the Passion\nthat John would prefer.\n\nBut there is always a judgement call based on pastoral considerations.\nEach pastor makes his own decisions (it isn't a church-wide conspiracy\nagainst participation).  The Palm Sunday liturgy, with its initial\nblessing and distribution of the palms and procession, is already\ngetting long before you get to the Passion; some pastors feel that they\nshould not make the people stand through that long narrative.  Also, the\norchestrated proclamation with multiple readers and public participation\nin the crowd quotations runs longer than the single-reader proclamation\n--- in churches with multiple Masses for the Sunday, it might be\nnecessary to go with the briefer options just to "get 'em in and get 'em\nout".\n\nEach parish is different.  Catholics are no longer canonically tied to\ntheir geographic parishes.  It is possible that another Catholic parish\nin the Columbus area (based on the Ohio State address) has a liturgy\ncloser to your preferences.  Or talk to some of your fellow\nparishioners and see how common your preferences are --- pastors\ngenerally ARE willing to listen to non-confrontational requests.  Though\nyou probably should bring along a paramedic in case he reacts too strongly\nto the shock of people asked for a _longer_ Sunday Mass.\n\nPerhaps the problem is that recent liturgical development hasn't follow\nthe continuous evolution model (the accumulation of small changes, no\nsingle one of which is too hard to take) but rather the punctuated\nequilibrium model (things stay the same and we get accustomed to them,\nthen the marked mutation hits).  {My apologies if I am mis-remembering\nthe names of the evolutionary theories.}

Actually, an apostle is someone who is sent.  If you will, mailmen could\nbe called apostles in that sense.  However, with Jesus, they were\ndesignated and were given power.  Remember that there were many\nthousands of people who witnessed what Jesus did.  That didn't make them\napostles, though.

seanna@bnr.ca (Seanna (S.M.) Watson) asks:\n > What is the objection to celebration of Easter?\n \n       The objection naturally is in the way in which you phrase it. \nEaster (or Eashtar or Ishtar or Ishtarti or other spellings) is the pagan\nwhore goddess of fertility.  Therefore, your question to me is "what is\nthe objection to celebration of the pagan whore goddess?"  When phrased\nthat way I suspect (or at least I would HOPE) that it becomes immeadiately\napparent what my objection to "celebrating" her would be.\n \n > It is celebration of the resurrection of Jesus.\n \n      No, you are thinking perhaps of "Ressurection Sunday" I think. \n(Though I'm not too crazy about the word "Sunday", but I certainly like\nthis phrasing much better than envoking the name of the whore goddess.)\n     For that matter, stay Biblical and call it Omar Rasheet (The Feast of\nFirst Fruits).  Torah commands that this be observed on the day following\nthe Sabbath of Passover week.  (Sunday by any other name in modern\nparlance.)  Why is there so much objection to observing the Resurrection\non the 1st day of the week on which it actually occured?  Why jump it all\nover the calendar the way Easter does?  Why not just go with the Sunday\nfollowing Passover the way the Bible has it?  Why seek after unbiblical\nmethods?\n \n > I don't recall a command in Scripture for us to celebrate\n > the resurrection, but it is the sole and only reason that\n > we are Christians--how could we not celebrate it?\n \n      So what does this question have to do with Easter (the whore\ngoddess)?  I am all for celebrating the Resurrection.  Just keep that\nwhore out of the discussion.\n \n > If it is only the name which is a problem, I suggest that if\n > we are too concerned about etymology, there are a lot of\n > words we are going to have to drop.  (As an aside, some\n > terminally PC people here in Ottawa want dictionaries to be\n > altered so that there are no negative definitions associated\n > with the word _black_, so as not to offend people of colour.\n \n       Yes, I have heard of your newspapers speaking of the need to repave\nstreets with "Afro-Canadiantop".  <grin> (I still think "blacktop" sounds\nbetter though.)\n \n > As a short person, I hope they will also remove the definition\n > "curt or surly" associated with my physical description.)\n \n       Fine by me.  And while we are at it, the left-handed people are\nboth "sinister" and "gauche" so we probably will have some objections from\nthat quarter as well.\n \n > In Quebec French, the word for the celebration of the\n > resurrection is "Pa^ques"--this is etymologically related\n > to Pesach (Passover) and the pascal lamb.  So is the\n > French Canadian (mostly Roman Catholic) celebration better\n > because it uses the right name?\n \n      Yes, that sounds much better to me.  Is there anyone out there would\nthinks that phrasing sounds worse?\n \n > So from this I infer that there are different rules for\n > Christians of Jewish descent?  What happened to "there is\n > neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male nor female, for\n > all are one in Christ Jesus"?\n \n      Read the letter to Philemon.  Now tell me, was Philemon's "slave"\nreturned to him?  Were there different rules upon the slave than upon\nPhilemon?  How about male and female?  Are there different "rules" that\napply to them as well?  Or if there is no more "male and female" can Adam\nand Steve get married to each other in your congregation?  Yes, there are\ndifferences in form and function.  But the way we come to Salvation in\nMessiah remains the same no matter what our position in life.\n \n---------------------------------------\n\n[I am in general not in favor of continuing this discussion, as it\nseems repetitive, but this particular point is one that I believe is\nnew -- the objection is not to having a holiday but to its name.\n\nI'd like to suggest that people think very carefully about this\nargument.  Words often change their meaning over time.  The days of\nthe week are of course originally based on pagan gods.  Some\nChristians prefer to refer to "first day", "second day", etc.  However\nthe majority of Christians have not been persuaded.  The question\nseems to be whether it makes any difference what the dictionary shows\nas the derivation of a word, if what people mean by it and think when\nthey use it is different.\n\nIndeed I'd like to suggest that postings like this could themselves be\ndangerous.  Suppose people in general use Easter to mean the\ncelebration of Christ's resurrection.  Postings trying to convince\nthem that they really mean a celebration in honor of some godess run\nthe risk of creating exactly the situation that they claim to oppose.\nThey are doing their best to *create* a linkage in people's minds\nbetween their celebration and the pagan goddess.  It's not clear that\nthis is a healthy thing.
I see some irony here. Jesus was willing to go through torture to free\nyou from the definite promise of hell (based on Adam/Eve's fall from grace)\nbut rather than allow him to stand in your place, you would give up\nyour redemption to stand with those who do not accept his grace.\nGod would rather have none in hell, which seems to put the burden of \nchoice on us. Of course, this is all fictional anyway since you reject him\nalso.\n\nMy former sociology professor once told us at the beginning\nof our term, "you all start out with an A...what you do with that during\nthe course of this term is up to you". In the beginning...Adam and Eve\nwere given an A.
This is a good point.  Christ was hardly the only person who claimed to be\nthe Messiah--in fact, a number of "Messiahs" were active in the area from the\ntime of the Roman conquest to after the fall of Masada.\n  Many of the statements made by the apostles--especially their repeated\nattempts to give Jesus a sword (give him military power) point to the fact that\nthey didn't realize the true nature of his reign until after the fact.  Many of\nthe statements in the Bible can be seen as being oriented toward explaining \nthis new definition of "Messiah" to the Jews who were being preached to.
Dean Velasco quoted a letter from James M Stowell, president of\nMoody Bible Institute:\n\n\n\nThere has been a lot of discussion, but so far nobody seems to have hit on\nexactly what the criticism of "arrogance" is aimed at.\n\nThe arrogance being attacked is that we "think we are the only ones who know\nwhat the absolutes are".  In short, many evangelicals claim that they are\ninfallible on the matter of religious texts.\n\nIn particular, the problem is one of epistemology.  As a shorthand, you can\nthink of epistemology as "how do you know?"  That question, it turns out, is\na very troubling one.\n\nThe problem with `absolute certainty' is that, at the bottom, at least some of\nthe thinking goes on inside your own head.  Unless you can be certain that\neverything which happens in your head is infallible, the reasoning you did to\ndiscover a source of truth is in question.\n\nAnd that means you do NOT have absolute justification for your source of\nauthority -- which means you do NOT have absolute certainty.\n\n\nLet's take the specific example of Biblical Inerrancy, and a fictional\nInerrantist named Zeke.  (The following arguments applies to the idea of\nPapal Infallibility, too.)\n\nZeke has, we presume, spent some time studying the Bible, and history, and\nseveral other topics.  He has concluded, based on all these studies (and\npossibly some religious experiences) that the Bible is a source of Absolute\nTruth.\n\nHe may be correct; but even if he is, he cannot be certain that he is correct.\nHis conclusion depends on how well he studied history -- he may have made\nmistakes, and the references he used may have contained mistakes.  His\nconclusion depends on how well he studied the Bible -- he may have made\nmistakes.  His conclusion depends on his own reasoning -- and he may have made\nmistakes.  (Noticing a common thread yet?  8-)\n\nEverything about his study of the world that he did -- everything that\nhappened in his own head -- is limited by his own thinking.  No matter what\nhe does to try and cover his mistakes, he can never be certain of his own\ninfallibility.  As long as ANY PART of the belief is based on his own\nreasoning, that belief cannot be considered "absolutely certain".\n\nZeke believes that he has found a source of absolute truth -- but that belief\nis only as good as the quality of the search he made for it.  Unless he can\nsay that his own reasoning is flawless, his conclusions are in doubt.\n\nAny belief that you hold about absolute sources of truth depends in part on\nyour own thinking -- there is no way out of the loop.  Only an infallible\nthinker can have absolute certainty in all his beliefs.\n\n\nThis is easy to demonstrate.  Let's go back to our shorthand method of doing\nepistemology: "how do you know?"  Imagine a hypothetical discussion:\n\n A: The Bible is a source of absolute truth.\n\n B: How do you know?\n\n A: I studied history and the Bible and religious writings and church\n    teachings and came to this conclusion.\n\n B: How do you know you studied history correctly?\n\n A: Well, I double-checked everything.\n\n B: How do you know you double-checked correctly?\n\n A: Well, I compared my answers with some smart people and we agreed.\n\n B: Just because some smart guy believes something that doesn't mean it is\n    true.  How do you know THEY studied it correctly?\n\n A: ...\n\nAnd, as you see, B will eventually get A to the point where he has to say "I\ncan't prove that there are no mistakes" -- and as long as you may have made a\nmistake, then you cannot be ABSOLUTELY certain.\n\nThere is no way out of the loop.\n\n\nThis is where the "arrogance of Christians" arises: many people believe\nthat their own personal research can give them absolute certainty about the\ndoctrines of Christianity -- they are implicitly claiming that they are\ninfallible, and that there is no possibility of mistake.\n\nClaiming that you CANNOT have made a mistake, and that your thinking has led\nyou to a flawless conclusion, is pretty arrogant.\n\n *\n\nPeople who want to see this argument explained in great detail should try to\nfind _The Infallibility of the Church_, by George Salmon.  He is attacking\nthe idea that the Pope can be knowably infallible (and he does so very well),\nbut the general argument applies equally well to the idea that the Bible is\nknowably Inerrant.

Let's get back to basics.  Canon (from the latin) means a rule.  If\nwe say that a rule is open then its a rule made to be broken.  \nThere is an issue also of measurement against a rule.  Thus the words\nthat are spoken need to be compared against the rule/canon but not\nadded to the canon.\n\nIs new revelation necessary?  Topical, current, personal revelation\nI'd say is necessary.  New revelation for all people for all times\nis not necessary as we have that in Scripture.\n\nYou also seem to confuse canon with scripture.  Scripture may speak of\nitself being open - ie God speaking today.  It would speak that it is\nclosed in the sense that the canon is unchangeable.  (Though the concept\nof canon is later historically.)\n\n\nI agree with the problem of confusion.  If prophecy is meant to encourage,\nexhort or correct then is an overlap with scripture.  If prophecy is\nmeant to bring a `word' of the form "the man you live with is not your\nhusband" then that is knowledge.  Yet the exact words their are scripture.\nI would expect the difference to be the motive and means for delivery.\nThe reading of scripture itself can be a powerful force.\n\nRegards\n David
According to mdbs@ms.uky.edu, muslims tithe 1/6 of their income.\n\nPerhaps there are some offshoots of Islam that impose this on their\nfollowers.  But the standard tithe is 1/40 of one's net worth, once\na year.\n\nThe same writer also objects to the Bible for teaching that\n\n > "woman was created after man, to be his helper" etc.\n\nThis is presumably a reference to Genesis 2. Suppose that that\nchapter had been written with the sexes reversed. We have God\ncreating woman, and then saying, "It is not good that woman should\nbe alone. I will make a help meet for her." Feminists would be\noutraged. The clear implication would be that God had started at the\nbottom and worked up, making first the plants, then the fish and\nbirds, then the beasts, then woman, and finally His masterpiece, the\nMale Chauvinist Pig. The statement that woman is not capable of\nfunctioning by herself, that she needs a man to open doors for her,\nwould have been seen as a particularly gratuitous insult. The fact\nthat the creation of woman from the dust of the ground was given\nonly briefly and in general, while the creation of the Man was given\nin six times the number of words, would have been cited as evidence\nof the author's estimate of the relative importance of the sexes.\nThe verdict would have been unequivocal. "No self-respecting woman\ncan accept this book as a moral guide, or as anything but sexist\ntrash!" I suggest that Moses, fearing this reaction, altered his\noriginal draft and described the creation with Adam first and then\nEve, so as to appease Miriam and other radical feminists of the day.\nFor some reason, however, it did not work.
[deletia- and so on]\n\nI seem to have been rather unclear.\n\nWhat I was asking is this:\n\nPlease show me that the most effective substance-absure recovery\nprograms involve meetinsg peoples' spiritual needs, rather than\nmerely attempting to fill peoples' spiritual needs as percieved\nby the people, A.A, S.R.C. regulars, or snoopy. This will probably\ninvolve defining "spritual needs" (is it not that clear) and\nshowing that such things exist and how they can be filled.\n\nAnnother tack you might take is to say that "fulfilling spiritual\nneeds" means "acknowledging a "higher power" of some sort, then\nshow that systems that do require this, work better than otherwise\nidentical systems that do not. A correlation here would help you,\nbut as you point out this might just be demonstrating swapping\none crutch for annother. (however, I do feel that religion is\nusually a better crutch than alchohol, as it is not usually\npoisonous! :) )\n\nI hope with that clarification, my question will be answerable. I actually\ndid know about the 12 step program, its the question of what it does,\nrather than what it tries to do, that makes a difference to me.\n---\n			- Dan Johnson\nAnd God said "Jeeze, this is dull"... and it *WAS* dull.

I have discussed this with my girlfriend often.  I consider myself married,\nthough legally I am not.  Neither of us have been with other people sexually,\nalthough we have been with each other.  We did not have sexual relations\nuntil we decided to marry eventually.  For financial and distance reasons,\nwe will not be legally married for another year and a half.  Until then,\nI consider myself married for life in God's eyes.  I have faith that we\nhave a strong relationship, and have had for over 4 years, and will be\nfull of joy when we marry in a church.  First, however, we must find a\nchurch( we will be living in a new area when we marry, and will need to\nfind a new church community).\n\nAnyway, I feel that if two people commit to marriage before God, they are\nmarried and are bound by that commitment.

Oh yea?  Which version of the Bible is the perfectly preserved one?  And\nwhy are there so many translations that are not perfectly preserved?  Is\nGod trying to confuse us?\n\n\nBut that is exactly what happend.  There are so many branches of \ndenominations of Christianity and deviations of doctrine portruding\nfrom varying translations of biblical texts by "serious students" that\nare much too numerous to begin to count.  If there is a Perfect Bible,\nthen there would be no possible misinterpretation and there would be\nno need for anyone here to be debating it.  On the other hand, maybe\nthe Bible is perfect, but no one on this planet is perfect enough to\nread it correctly, but then there would be no point in God giving us\nsomething we cannot use correctly.\n\n\nIMHO, if you trust your salvation on the reliability of a single book,\nyou are on weak ground.  Remember, In the beginning was the Word, and\nthe Word was with God, and the Word was God.  This Word existed BEFORE\nthe Bible was written.  (Note: Word <==> God).  This Word that John is\ntrying to describe cannot be fully described in any written language,\nall languages being IMPERFECT.  Realization comes only from contemplation\nof the Word, and is outside the boundaries of language.  I use the Bible\nas a guide, a stepping stone, but in no way is it my final authority.\nGod alone is the final authority.
Where in the Bible is there *any* teaching about an immaterial afterlife?\nI was always taught that both the O.T. Jews and the N.T. Christians would\nhave found the notion incomprehensible--as do I.\n\nDon't we christians believe in the resurrection of the body?\n\nOr do you mean by material simply the stuff made of the 100+ elements\nthat we know and love too much?

[With Frank's permission, I have added some information here (and in\none case changed the order of his contributions) in order to clarify\nthe historical relationship of the views.  My comments are based\nprimarily on William Rusch's historical summary in "The Trinitarian\nControversy", Fortress.  I'm going to save this as an FAQ.  --clh]\n\nMAJOR VIEWS OF THE TRINITY\n \n[SECOND CENTURY\n\nThe writers of the 2nd Cent. are important, because they set up much\nof the context for the later discussions.  Justin Martyr, Aristides,\nAthenagoras, Tatian, and Theophilus of Antioch are known as the\n"Apologists".  Their theology has often been described as "Logos\ntheology".  Based strongly on wording in John, they took more or less\na two-phase approach.  Through eternity, the Logos was with the\nFather, as his mind or thought.  This "immanent Word" became\n"expressed" as God revealed himself in history, ultimately in Jesus.\nThus Jesus' full distinction from the Father only became visible in\nhistory, though the Logos had been present in God from eternity.\nRusch regards this view is containing many of the emphases of the\nfinal orthodox position, but in a form which is less sophisticated,\nbecause it did not have the technical language to properly deal with\nthe eternal plurality in the Godhead.\n\nIrenaeus held views somewhat similar to the Apologists.  However he\nwas uncomfortable with the two-stage approach.  He still viewed God as\none personage, with distinctions that did not become fully visible\nexcept through his process of self-revelation (the "economy").  The\ndistinctions are present in his essential nature.  Irenaeus emphasized\nthe Holy Spirit more than the Apologists.  Irenaeus' views should\nprobably be called "economic trinitarianism", though that term is\nnormally used (as below) to refer to later developments.\n\n\nTHIRD CENTURY\n\n--clh]\n\nDynamic Monarchianism\n \nSource: Theodotus\nAdherents: Paul of Samosota, Artemon, Socinus, Modern Unitarians\nPerception of God's Essence: The unity of God denotes both oneness of nature\nand oneness of person. The Son and the Holy Spirit therefore are\nconsubstantial with the Father's divine essence only as impersonal attributes.\nThe divine dunamis came upon the man Jesus, but he was not God in the strict\nsense of the word.\nPerception of God's Subsistence: The notion of a subsistent God is a palpable\nimpossibility, since his perfect unity is perfectly indivisible. The\n'diversity' of God is apparent and not real, since the Christ event and the\nwork of the Holy Spirit attest only to a dynamic operation within God, not to\na hypostatic union.\nAsignation of Deity/Eternality:\n Father: Unique originator of the universe. He is eternal, self-existent, and\nwithout beginning or end.\n Son: A virtuous (but finite) man in whose life God was dynamically present in\na unique way; Christ definitely was not deity though his humanity was deified.\n Holy Spirit: An impersonal attribute of the Godhead. No deity or eternality\nis ascribed to the Holy Spirit.\nCriticism(s): Elevates reason above the witness of biblical revelation\nconcerning the Trinity. Categorically denies the deity of Christ and of the\nHoly Spirit, thereby undermining the theological undergirding for the biblical\ndoctrine of salvation.\n[In summary, this probably best thought of as not being Trinitarianism\nat all.  God is an undifferentiated one.  Son and Holy Spirit are seen\nas simply names for the man Jesus and the grace of God active in the\nChurch.  --clh]\n\n \nModalistic Monarchianism\n \nSource: Praxeas\nAdherents: Noatus, Sabellius, Swedenborg, Scleiermacher, United Pentecostals\n(Jesus Only)\nPerception of God's Essence: The unity of God is ultra-simplex. He is\nqualitatively characterized in his essence by one nature and person.  This\nessence may be designated interchangeably as Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.\nThey are different names for but identical with the unified, simplex God. The\nthree names are the three modes by which God reveals Himself.\nPerception of God's Subsistence: The concept of a subsistent God is erroneous\nand confounds the real issue of the phenomenon of God's modalistic manifesting\nof himself. The paradox of a subsisting "three in oneness" is refuted by\nrecognizing that God is not three persons but one person with three different\nnames and corresponding roles following one another like parts of a drama.\nAsignation of Deity/Eternality:\n Father: Fully God and fully eternal as the primal mode or manifestation of\nthe only unique and unitary God\n Son: Full deity/eternality ascribed only in the sense of his being another\nmode of the one God and identical with his essence. he is the same God\nmanifested in temporal sequence specific to a role (incarnation).\n Holy Spirit: Eternal God only as the tile designates the phase in which the\none God, in temporal sequence, manifested himself pursuant to the role of\nregeneration and sanctification.\nCriticism(s): Depersonalizes the Godhead. To compensate for its Trinitarian\ndeficiencies, this view propounds ideas that are clearly heretical. Its\nconcept of successive manifestations of the Godhead cannot account for such\nsimultaneous appearances of the three persons as at Christ's baptism.\n[Rusch comments that evidence on these beliefs is sketchy.  There are\nactually two slightly different groups included: Noetus and his\nfollowers, and Sabellius.  Noetus was apparently more extreme.\nSabellius followed him, and attempted to use some features of economic\nTrinitarianism to create a more sophisticated view.  Unfortunately,\ninformation about Sabellius comes from a century later, and there\nseems to be some confusion between him and Marcellus of Ancyra. --clh]\n \n[I've moved the following description to be with the other\nthird-century views.  It originally appeared near the end.  --clh]\n\n"Economic" Trinitarianism\n \nSource: Hippolytus, Tertullian\nAdherents: Various "neo-economic" Trinitarians\nPerception of God's Essence: The Godhead is characterized by triunity: Father,\nSon, and Holy Spirit are the three manifestations of one identical,\nindivisible substance. The perfect unity and consubstantiality are especially\ncomprehended in such manifest Triadic deeds as creation and redemption.\nPerception of God's Subsistence: Subsistence within the Godhead is articulated\nby means of such terms as "distinction" and "distribution" dispelling\neffectively the notion of separateness or division.\nAsignation of Deity/Eternality:\nThe equal deity of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit is clearly elucidated in\nobservation of the simultaneous relational/operational features of the\nGodhead. Co-eternality, at times, does not intelligibly surface in this\nambiguous view, but it seems to be a logical implication.\nCriticism(s): Is more tentative and ambiguous in its treatment of the\nrelational aspect of the Trinity.\n[Note that this is a development of the Apologists and Irenaeus, as\nmentioned above.  As with them, the threeness is visible primarily in\nthe various ways that God revealed himself in history.  However they\ndid say that this is a manifestation of a plurality that is somehow\npresent in the Godhead from the beginning.  Tertullian talks of\nthe Father, Son, and Holy Spirit as being three that are one in\nsubstance.  Many people regard this view as being essentially\northodox, but with less developed philosophical categories.  --clh]\n\n[Origen, developing further an approach started by Clement, attempted\nto apply neo-Platonism to Christian thought.  He set many of the terms\nof the coming battle.  In Platonic fashion, he sees the Son as a\nmediator, mediating between the absolute One of God and the plurality\nof creating beings.  The Son is generated, but he is "eternally\ngenerated".  That is, the relationship between Father and Son is\neternal.  It cannot be said that "there was once when he was not" (a\nphrase that will haunt the discussion for centuries).  Having the Son\nis intrinsic to his concept of God.  The Father and Son are described\nas separate "hypostases", though this may not have quite the meaning\nof separate subsistence that it had in some contexts.  The union is\none of love and action, but there is some reason to think that he may\nhave used the term homoousios ("of the same substance").  The Holy\nSpirit is also an active, personal substance, originated by the Father\nthrough the Son.  Origen's intent is trinitarian, not tritheistic, but\nhe pushes things in the direction of separateness.\n\n\nFOURTH CENTURY\n\n--clh]\n\nSubordinationism  [often called Arianism --clh]\n \nSource: Arius\nMajor Adherents: Modern Jehovah's Witnesses, and several other lesser known\ncults\nPerception of God's Essence: The inherent oneness of God's nature is properly\nidentifiable with the Father only. The Son and the Holy Spirit are discreet\nentities who do not share the divine essence.\nPerception of God's Subsistence: The unipersonal essence of God precludes the\nconcept of divine subsistence with a Godhead. "Threeness in oneness" is self-\ncontradictory and violates biblical principles of a monotheistic God.\nAsignation of Deity/Eternality:\n Father: The only one, unbegotten God who is eternal and without beginning.\n Son: A created being and therefore not eternal. Though he is to be venerated,\nhe is not of the divine essence.\n Holy Spirit: A nonpersonal, noneternal emanation of the Father. He is viewed\nas an influence, an expression of God.  Deity is not ascribed to him.\nCriticism(s): It is at variance with abundant scriptural testimony respecting\nthe deity of both Christ and the Holy Spirit. Its hierarchial concept likewise\nasserts three essentially separate persons with regard to the Father, Christ,\nand the Holy Spirit. This results in a totally confused soteriology.\n[Note also that in most versions of this view, the Son is not fully\nhuman either.  He is supernatural and sinless.  That distinguishes this\nview from adoptionism.  --clh]\n \nOrthodox Trinitarianism\n \nSource: Athanasius\nAdherents: Basil, Gregory of Nyssa, Gregory of Nazianzus, Augustine, Thomas\nAquinas, Luther, Calvin, Contemporary orthodox Christianity\nPerception of God's Essence: God's being is perfectly unified and simplex: of\none essence.  This essence of deity is held in common by Father, Son, and Holy\nSpirit. The three persons are consubstantial, coinherent, co-equal, and co-\neternal.\nPerception of God's Subsistence: The divine subsistence is said to occur in\nthree modes of being or hypostases. As such, the Godhead exists "undivided in\ndivided persons." This view contemplates an identity in nature and cooperation\nin function without the denial of distinctions of persons in the Godhead.\nAsignation of Deity/Eternality:\nIn its final distillation, this view unhesitatingly sets forth Father, Son,\nand Holy Spirit as co-equal and co-eternal in the Godhead with regard to both\nthe divine essence and function.\nCriticism(s): The only shortcoming has to do with the limitations inherent in\nhuman language and thought itself: the impossibility of totally describing the\nineffable mystery of "three in oneness."\n[At least in the 4th Cent, there were several different approaches, all\nof which fit the description here, and all regarded as orthodox, but which\nare somewhat different in detail.  Nicea was originally held to respond\nto Arius.  Arius can be thought of as carrying Origen's thought a bit\ntoo far, to the point of making the Son a separate entity.  In general\nthe East tended to take an approach based on Origen's, and it was hard\nto get acceptance of Nicea in the East.  Its final acceptance was\nbased on the work of Athanasius with the Cappadocians: Gregory of Nyssa and\nGregory of Nazianzus, among others.  While starting with three,\nthey show that their unity in nature and and action is such that one\nmust think of them as being a single God.  This allowed the Council\nof Constantinople, in 381, to get wide agreement on the idea of\nthree hypostatese and one ousia.  --clh]\n\nAdapted from _Charts of Christian Theology and Doctrine_, by H.

I wrote in response to dlecoint@garnet.acns.fsu.edu (Darius_Lecointe):\n\n\nWas Paul a God too? Is an interpretation of the words of Paul of higher\npriority than the direct word of Jesus in Matt5:14-19? Paul begins\nRomans 14 with "If someone is weak in the faith ..." Do you count\nyourself as one who is weak in the faith?\n\n\nYes, but what does the Bible have to say? What did Jesus say?

Is there any doubt in your mind\nabout what is right and what is sin (Greek hamartia = missing the mark)?\n\n\nWhereas, the Ten Commandments and Jesus' words in Matt5:14-19 are fairly\nclear, are they not?\n\n\nMatt5:14-19 doesn't answer your question?\n\n\nBreaking bread - roughly synonymous with eating.\n\n\nHow do you unite this concept of yours with the Ten Commandments and\nJesus's word in Matt5:14-19?\n\n\nOr, they assumed that the Ten Commandments and Jesus' word in\nMatt5:14-19 actually stood for something? Perhaps they were "strong in\nthe faith?"\n\n---------------------------\n\n[No, I don't believe that Paul can overrule God.  However Paul was\nwriting for a largely Gentile audience.  The Law was regarded by Jews\nat the time (and now) as binding on Jews, but not on Gentiles.  There\nare rules that were binding on all human beings (the so-called Noachic\nlaws), but they are quite minimal.  The issue that the Church had to\nface after Jesus' death was what to do about Gentiles who wanted to\nfollow Christ.  The decision not to impose the Law on them didn't say\nthat the Law was abolished.  It simply acknowledged that fact that it\ndidn't apply to Gentiles.  Thus there is no contradiction with Mat 5.\nAs far as I can tell, both Paul and other Jewish Christians did\ncontinue to participate in Jewish worship on the Sabbath.  Thus they\ncontinued to obey the Law.  The issue was (and is) with Gentile\nChristians, who are not covered by the Law (or at least not by the\nceremonial aspects of it).\n\nJesus dealt mostly with Jews.  I think we can reasonably assume that\nMat 5 was directed to a Jewish audience.  He did interact with\nGentiles a few times (e.g. the centurion whose slave was healed and a\ncouple of others).  The terms used to describe the centurion (see Luke\n7) suggest that he was a "God-fearer", i.e. a Gentile who followed\nGod, but had not adopted the whole Jewish Law.  He was commended by\nJewish elders as a worthy person, and Jesus accepted him as such.\nThis seems to me to indicate that Jesus accepted the prevailing view\nthat Gentiles need not accept the Law.\n\nHowever there's more involved if you want to compare Jesus and Paul on\nthe Law.  In order to get a full picture of the role of the Law, we\nhave to come to grips with Paul's apparent rejection of the Law, and\nhow that relates to Jesus' commendation of the Law.  At least as I\nread Paul, he says that the Law serves a purpose that has been in a\ncertain sense superceded.  Again, this issue isn't one of the\nabolition of the Law.  In the middle of his discussion, Paul notes\nthat he might be understood this way, and assures us that that's not\nwhat he intends to say.  Rather, he sees the Law as primarily being\npresent to convict people of their sinfulness.  But ultimately it's an\nimpossible standard, and one that has been superceded by Christ.\nPaul's comments are not the world's clearest here, and not everyone\nagrees with my reading.  But the interesting thing to notice is that\neven this radical position does not entail an abolition of the Law.\nIt still remains as an uncompromising standard, from which not an iota\nor dot may be removed.  For its purpose of convicting of sin, it's\nimportant that it not be relaxed.  However for Christians, it's not\nthe end -- ultimately we live in faith, not Law.\n\nWhile the theoretical categories they use are rather different, in the\nend I think Jesus and Paul come to a rather similar conclusion.  The\nquoted passage from Mat 5 should be taken in the context of the rest\nof the Sermon on the Mount, where Jesus shows us how he interprets the\nLaw.  The "not an iota or dot" would suggest a rather literal reading,\nbut in fact that's not Jesus' approach.  Jesus' interpretations\nemphasize the intent of the Law, and stay away from the ceremonial\ndetails.  Indeed he is well known for taking a rather free attitude\ntowards the Sabbath and kosher laws.  Some scholars claim that Mat\n5:17-20 needs to be taken in the context of 1st Cent. Jewish\ndiscussions.  Jesus accuses his opponents of caring about giving a\ntenth of even the most minor herbs, but neglecting the things that\nreally matter: justice, mercy and faith, and caring about how cups and\nplates are cleaned, but not about the fact that inside the people who\nuse them are full of extortion and rapacity.  (Mat 23:23-25) This, and\nthe discussion later in Mat 5, suggest that Jesus has a very specific\nview of the Law in mind, and that when he talks about maintaining the\nLaw in its full strength, he is thinking of these aspects of it.\nPaul's conclusion is similar.  While he talks about the Law being\nsuperceded, all of the specific examples he gives involve the\n"ceremonial law", such as circumcision and the Sabbath.  He is quite\nconcerned about maintaining moral standards.\n\nThe net result of this is that when Paul talks about the Law being\nsuperceded, and Jesus talks about the Law being maintained, I believe\nthey are talking about different aspects of the Law.  Paul is\nembroiled in arguments about circumcision.  As is natural in letters\nresponding to specific situations, he's looking at the aspect of the\nLaw that is currently causing trouble: the Law as specifically Jewish\nceremonies.  He certainly does not intend to abolish divine standards\nof conduct.  On the other hand, when Jesus commends the Law, he seems\nto be talking the Law in its broadest implications for morals and\nhuman relationships, and deemphasizing those aspects that were later\nto give Paul so much trouble.\n\nIt's unfortunate that people use the same terms in different ways, but\nwe should be familiar with that from current conflicts.  Look at the\nway terms like "family values" take on special meaning from the\ncurrent context.  Imagine some poor historian of the future trying to\nfigure out why "family values" should be used as a code word for\nopposition to homosexuality in one specific period in the U.S.  I\nthink Law had taken on a similar role in the arguments Paul was\ninvolved in.  Paul was clearly not rejecting all of the Jewish values\nthat go along with the term "Law", any more than people who concerned\nabout the "family values" movement are really opposed to family\nvalues.

I deleted much of the following article in order to discuss the \nspecific issue of whether it is acceptable to divorce.  \n\n\n\nI have thought about the implications, and it is scary.  \n\nWe have a whole generation of families broken up because some men have \ndecided that is is okay to leave their wives and children for the\nthrill of a younger, more attractive woman.  If we accept that it is\nlegitimate for Jane to have divorced, how can we not accept anyone's\ndecision to divorce because he has found someone with whom he can\nhave a more "deep, committed relationship."\n\nMarriage is not a state of being, it is a mutual journey in life.\nLove is not a passive feeling, it must be actively willed.\n\nIs it acceptable for an older executive to dump his wife of many \nyears who stayed home to care for the children because he\ncan't be happy sexually unless he is with a beautiful\nyoung blonde?  The real solution for both in the couple to\nmake a renewed effort.  \n\nHold fast to the faith.  Has not the Lord repeatedly compared His\nrelation to His people as a faithful and enduring husband?  We\nlearn something very deep and very mystical when we marry and\nremain faithful through times of trial.\n\nMy spouse has a brain tumor that has left her partially paralyzed.\nIf it were to resume growing (it is in remission, thanks be to God!)\nthen perhaps the time would come when we could not have sexual\nrelations.  That's life...the Lord would certainly not give me\npermission to seek someone else to satisfy my "needs."  \n\nThe idea that it is alright to divorce if a couple "grows apart"\nseems to me to lead to such a monstrous destruction of the meaning\nof marriage that I feel we must make every effort to avoid any hint\nof compromise.  We have become so petty and small-minded that\nsome husbands are threatening to divorce their wives unless the\nwives lose weight!
Were the early Christians weird?  Yes!  So were their non-Christian\ncontemporaries (the more familiar you are with late Republican Rome\nor the Pricipate, the weirder those people will seem -- forget the\ncreative filtering done by Renaissance and Eighteenth Century hero\nworship.)  So are modern non-Christians.  And Christians.\n\nYou are pretty weird, yourself, with your rather acid dismissal of\nLuther and of Protestantism -- and in apparently buying into a\nsimplistic propaganda model about Catholicism *not* being faddish.  \nSure, it's so large that global fads take longer cycles than they\ndo in smaller denominations (and local ones are not usually visible\nunless you do a lot of traveling to exotic lands :-)).  May I recom-\nmend, as a salutary antidote to this nonsense Philippe Aries' book\n_The Hour of our Death_, a longitudinal study of death customs in \nWestern [specifically Catholic] Christendom?\n\nAnd it won't help to escape into the obscurity of the first Christian\ncentury.  Paul was pretty weird, too; as were Peter and the others in\nthe (apparently quite weird) circle around Jesus.\n\nWhat I think you might find helpful is a bit more charity -- try to\nunderstand these weirdos and nutcases with the same respect and love\nyou would expect others to show YOUR notions.  We *are* commanded to\nlove one another, after all.  And Brown's book is, in fact, a heroic\nattempt to SEE the groupings he talks about as motivated in love and\nthe gospel and their social contexts.  (If anything, Brown is *too*\nheroic here -- he manages to overstrain himself at times :-))\n\nI don't suggest that we *follow* any of these old cult paths -- and\nit raises hard questions from the skeptic inside me that so much of\nearly Christianity *was* like the weird (Christian and non-Christian)\ncults we see today.  To that extent, I think you raise a serious\nproblem (and perhaps your phrasing is implicitly self-deprecatory\nand ironic.)\n\nBut the first principle for *answering* these questions is respect and\nlove for those we do not understand.  And it helps to *work* at under-\nstanding (as long as we do not get overwhelmed by revulsion and begin\nto withdraw our respect for them as people.)  I would advise, in other\nwords, MORE historical reading (Brown's other books are also good, most\nespecially his bio. of Augustine; also try Robin Lane Fox's _Christians\nand Pagans_, maybe the Paul Veyne ed. _History of Private Life_, some\nof Foucault's books on sexuality in the ancient world ...)\n\nHumanity *is* weird -- we have known ONE sane person, and we killed Him.\nFortunately for us, this has proved a Comedy rather than a Tragedy.\n\nEaster, 1993.\n\n(yes; this is a tad early -- our Vigil service here has been moved forward\nbecause so many churches in the area have taken to doing their own Vigils,\nand the seminarians must therefore worship-and-run if they are to do it\nhere and there as well.  Think of this as an Anglican fad.  :-))
The concept of God as a teacher is indeed interesting. Does He grade on\na curve, does He cheat? That is interesting. Not to mention thought\nprovoking. My own concept is that He is a Father and we are His\nchildren. In that He loves us, with a love that we can never understand\nuntil we are with Him. The Bible says that He looks on the heart as the\nfinal measure. From that perspective, in a grading context, the heart is\nthe final test.\nSpecifically, most Christians would agree that there is only one Heaven\nand one Hell. From that perspective, it is Heaven or Hell. You either go\nto one or the other. The "grading" on a pass/fail basis is done by God\nthe Father with intervention by Jesus the Son. Not by others. For only\nGod sees the heart. The Bible says of the heart, "...who can know it." I\nwould say there has always been, and always be, an unchanging method.\nThat is what makes a relationship with Christ so secure. In an uncertain\nand ever changing landscape He is always the same. Yesterday, today and\ntomorrow. Concerning whether or not our childhoods are considerd as part\nof the test, my own conviction is no. Were that the case I certainly\nwouldn't be going to Heaven. The Bible speaks very plainly about the\nlove and care Jesus had for and about children. The reality is that we\nare all children. Some of us just have bigger bodies and grey hair. But\nthe Father, our Father is always there. Like most Fathers He wants only\nthe best for His own. There maybe decipline, but there is more love.\nIt's sometimes looks like Christianity is a test, to see who makes it\nand who doesn't. Those who do pass=Heaven, and those who don't go to the\nother place. But it is really much more than that...\nThere are few experts. Most of us are just travelers looking for the\nlight and the way Home. Praying that we can bring others with us.
My last article included this quote:\n\n "If any substantial number of  [ talk.religion.misc ]  readers read some\n  Wittgenstein, 60% of the postings would disappear.  (If they *understood*\n  some Wittgenstein, 98% would disappear. :-))" -- Michael L Siemon\n\n \n\nThere is a convention called a `smiley', which looks like this:   :-)  .\nIt is supposed to look like a sideways smiley-face, and indicates that the\npreceding comment is supposed to be funny.\n\n\nAnd, I'll note that I have participated on talk.religion.misc for over\nfive years -- I'd say Mr Siemon was not too far off.  8^)\n\n *\n\nIn the meat of his reply, Mr Boundary serves up an excellent example of what\nI meant by "There is no way out of the loop".  I wrote that human brains "are\ninfested with sin", and can be trusted only in limited circumstances.\n\n\n\nWhich just moves the problem back one level: how do you tell if your\nconscience is properly formed?\n\nThe only way to tell is to presuppose that you are capable of judging the\nformed-ness of your own conscience.  In other words, you can only be sure\nthat your conscience is `properly formed' if you assume that your evaluation\ncan be trusted.  Assuming your conclusions saves you a lot of time, I'll\ngrant, but it's not a valid way of reasoning.\n\nUnless you are infallible, your judgements about your own thinking cannot be\ncertain.  Therefore, it is not possible to be certain your conscience is\n`properly formed'.  (Whatever that is supposed to mean.)\n\n\nMr Boundary then gives another paradigm example of the problem:\n\n\nThe Church is `by necessity' the infallible interpreter of divine revelation?\nHow do you know?  Presumably, you believe this because of some argument or\nanother -- how do you know that the argument contains no mistakes?\n\nYou write:\n\n\nBut there is a huge difference between `confidence in our ability to\ndistinguish what is true from what is not true' and `infallible'.  I am\nconfident about a lot of things, but absolute certainty is a very long way\nfrom `confident'.\n\nThis discussion is about the arrogance of claiming to be absolutely certain\n(really, go check the subject line).  Saying you are absolutely certain is\nsignificantly different than saying you are confident.  When you say that\nyou are confident, that invites people to ask why.\n\nExcept in very limited circumstances, when you say that you are absolutely\ncertain, it invites people to dismiss you as someone who does not have any\nidea of his own fallibility.\n\n\nI have yet to meet anyone who believed in a knowably-infallible source of\ntruth who would admit the possibility of errors in his reasoning.  All of\nthem -- every last one -- has claimed that he was himself infallible.\nThe result has been to convince me that they had no idea what was going on.\n\n\nDarren F Provine / kilroy@gboro.rowan.edu\n\n[This particular discussion may not be entirely relevant to the\noriginal criticism.  I get the feeling that the original poster\nregarded as arrogant the very idea that there are right and wrong\nanswers in religion, and that the difference can have eternal\nconsequences.  When I say that I think there is a hell and that he is\nat least in significant danger of ending up there, I will admit that\n-- as you say -- the reasoning processes I used to reach this are\nfallible.  Thus at least in principle I could be wrong.  But these\nbasic facts are clearly enough taught in the Bible that I think it's\nunlikely that I'm misinterpreting it.  (In order to get this level of\nconfidence, I've tried to frame my statement sufficiently carefully as\nto sidestep a number of the more controversial issues.  I haven't, for\nexample said that all non-Christians will definitely end up in hell,\nand I haven't attempted to describe hell in any detail.)  I have a\nfeeling that my view is going to be regarded as arrogant and\nintolerant even though I acknowledge that I'm fallible and so there's\nsome chance I'm wrong.\n\nDon't get me wrong -- I think there are a lot of genuinely arrogant\nChristians, and often criticism of us is justified.  But in at least\nsome cases I think the criticisms constitute blaming the messenger.\nIf the universe is set up so that there are eternal consequences for\ncertain decisions, it's not my fault -- I'm just telling it the way I\nthink it is.  You may think God is immoral for setting things up that\nway.  It's one of the critiques of Christianity that I find it most\ndifficult to respond to.  But it's not arrogance for me to tell what\nI think is the truth.
As a former Catholic and now as a very active Lutheran - it is some of the\n"innovations" of the Mass which made me leave the Catholic Church and return\nto the more traditional Catholic Chuch - the Lutherans.\n\nI spent many years as a Lector reading the Passion parts as appropriate in\nthe Catholic Church and I found it very meaningful.  Our Lutheran parish just\ninstituted the "Tenebrae" service for Good Friday and I was the lector for \na paraphrased Passion which was exceptional.  I heard and learned things\nthat I have previously overlooked in the Gospels - yet those "facts" were\nalways there.  As a matter of interest, the pastor and I were talking about\nthe differences between the RC and Lutheran Church during Holy Week over\nbreakfast Easter Sunday.\n\nMy wife is the member of the liturgy committee in the family (called music\nand worship at our church).  Our pastor does have control of this committee\nbut listens very carefully to the committee's suggestions.  It needs a strong\nhand to lead and guide, to keep the intent and the message clear and strong\nas it should be through Lent and the rest of the liturgical year.  Additional\nreason for my leaving the Catholic faith - lack of any selfless spiritual\nguidance by priests in my parishes.  AKA "wishy-washy".\n \nAs you may gather from my comments, I feel that it is very important, ir-\nregardless of denominational guidelines, to have a service/Mass which promotes\nthe true reason that we are gathered there.  I am quite comfortable in a\ntraditional Mass, with receiving Holy Communion on the tongue, the Sacrament\nof PENANCE (not Reconciliation), Stations of the Cross, so on and so forth.\nThe reason other types of Masses and parishes exist is because these feelings\nare not shared by everyone.\n\nI want more people to attend church and to find the Lord, but I don't want \nthem attending a show.  It's not.  My church works hard to have a meaningful\nservice during Lent on Wednesdays, but follow traditional Lutheran Book of\nWorship guidelines.  Where things are changed or omitted during Lent (such\nas the Hymn of Praise) it is noted so that we are aware of the reasons that it\nis Not there.\n\nQuite frankly, it is very hard for a non-Catholic to go to a Mass and "fit in".\nMy dear wife never could (former Methodist).  And Holy Week Masses and Vigils\nwould intimidate the daylights out of a non-Catholic.  Those Catholics who\nhave beared with me this far understand what I mean.\n\nPlease keep in mind why we are there - to gather together in worship.  Not\nto worry about how something is done or not done.  If there is something\nwrong that you feel needs addressing, by all means talk to your priest or\npastor.  I have only ever met one who wouldn't listen.  They are there to \nprovide spiritual guidance and to help.  Use them.  My differences with\nthe Catholic Church are much more fundamental - but my decision to change\nfaiths was done with prayer, intervention, and sessions with priests and\nministers.\n\nIn Christ,\nKershner\n-- \nKershner Wyatt\nkwyatt@ccscola.ColumbiaSC.ncr.com
ddavis@cass.ma02.bull.com (Dave Davis)\n\n 	II. The deuterocanonicals are not in the canon because\n 		they are not quoted by the NT authors.\n\nThat is not quite accurate.  Otherwise we would have the book\nof Enoch in the canon (as Dave noted).  One can say that the \napocrypha are not quoted by Christ.  \n\n\nIII. The deuterocanonicals are not in the canon because\n 		they teach doctrines contrary to the (uncontroverted)\n 		parts of the canon.\n \n 	then I answer: \n 		These is a logically invalid *a priori*. \n 		Besides, we are talking about OT texts- \n 		which in many parts are superceded by the NT\n 		(in the Xtian view). Would not this same\n 		principle exclude _Ecclesiastes_?\n 		This principle cannot be consistently applied.\n \nI have to reject your argument here.  The Spirit speaks with one\nvoice, and he does not contradict himself.  \n\nThe ultimate test of canonicity is whether the words are inspired\nby the Spirit, i.e., God-breathed.  It is a test which is more\nguided by faith than by reason or logic.  The early church decided\nthat the Apocrypha did not meet this test--even though some books\nsuch as The Wisdom of Ben Sirach have their uses.  For example,\nthe Lutheran hymn "Now Thank We All Our God" quotes a passage\nfrom this book.\n\nThe deutero-canonical books were added much later in the church's\nhistory.  They do not have the same spiritual quality as the\nrest of Scripture.  I do not believe the church that added these\nbooks was guided by the Spirit in so doing.  And that is where\nthis sort of discussion ultimately ends.
This is the problem. This is not hell, this is permanent death. It is\nindeed what atheists (generally) expect and it is neither fair nor\nunfair, it just is. You might as well argue about whether being made\nmostly of carbon and water is "fair".\n\nHowever, the atheists who claim that Hell is unfair are talking about\nthe fire and brimstone place of endless suffering, which necessarily\nincludes eternal existance (life, I dunno, but some sort of continuation);\nnot at all the same thing.\n\nGranted, you clearly feel that hell=death, but this is not a univeral\nsentiment as near as I can tell.\n\nIf *your* idea of God "condemns" heathens to ordinary death, I have no\nproblem with that. I do have a problem with the gods that hide from humans\nand torture the unbelievers eternally for not guessing right.\n\n[deletia- Hell, and Literalness.]\n\n---\n			- Dan Johnson\nAnd God said "Jeeze, this is dull"... and it *WAS* dull.

On Palm Sunday at our parish, we were "invited" to take the role of\nJesus in the Passion.  I declined to participate.  Last year at the\nliturgy meeting I pointed out how we crucify Christ by our sins, so\ntherefore it is appropriate that we retain the role of the crowd, but\nto no avail.\n\n\n   As a member of a liturgy committee, I can tell you that the problem\nis certain people dominating, who want to try out all kinds of\ninnovations.  The priests don't seem even to _want_ to make any\ndecisions of their own in many cases.  I guess it's easier to "try\nsomething new" than it is to refuse to allow it.\n\n   At our parish on Holy Thursday, instead of the priests washing feet\n("Who wants to get around people's feet," according to one of our\npriests) the congregation was "invited" to come up and help wash one\nanother's hands.\n\n   The symbolism of this action distressed me, and again I refused to\nparticipate.  I thought that if we were to have to come up with\nrubrics for this liturgical action (i.e. "Body of Christ" -- "Amen"\nfor receiving Communion), that they could be "I am not responsible for\nthe blood of this man."\n\n   Also for part of the Eucharistic Prayer ("Blessed are You, God of\nall creation...") was substituted some text read by a lay couple.  The\npriest certainly should not have given this part of the Mass over to\nothers, and I was so disturbed that I declined to receive Communion\nthat night (we aren't required to anyway -- I instead offered up\nprayers for our priests and parish).\n\n\n   The quality of the Mass has not changed.  Again, if it were to be\ncelebrated according to the rubrics set down by the Church, it would\nstill be "liturgically" beautiful.  The problem comes about from\npeople trying to be "creative" who are not.\n\n   I think the answer to your question on participation could be that\ngiven by Father Peter Stravinskas in answer to the question posed by\nthe title of Thomas Day's _Why Catholics Can't Sing_.  "They don't\nwant to" because of all this nonsense.\n\n   By the way, for any non-Catholics reading this, the problem does\nnot reflect bad liturgy by the Catholic Church, but by those who are\ndisobedient to the Church in changing it on their own "authority."
This is being posted as a general outline for your personal study of this \ndoctrine:\n\n\n                        THE DOCTRINE OF GOD\n\n\nI.   THE PERSONS OF THE GODHEAD\n     Of all of the doctrines of Scripture, this is the most\n     important.  The Bible is pre-eminently a revelation of God. \n     Therefore, our first objective in studying the Bible should\n     be to know God.\n     I believe that the Bible teaches that there are Three\n     Persons in the Godhead (Trinity):  God, the Father; God the\n     Son--the Lord Jesus Christ; and God, the Holy Spirit.  I\n     believe that they are individual Persons who are one in\n     nature, meaning that They are identical in nature, each\n     possessing the same divine attributes.  They are also\n     equally worthy of our worship, our trust, and our obedience.\n     Cf. Matt.28:19, 2 Cor.13:14; John 14:8,9,16,17.\n\nII.  THE ATTRIBUTES, or CHARACTERISTICS, OF THE GODHEAD.\n     A.  God's nature is revealed in the Name He has taken for\n         Himself: Jehovah.  He is the living God, eternal, and\n         unchanging.  He is without beginning, and without\n         ending.  Cf. Isa.42:8.\n     B.  God is a spirit.  Cf. John 4:24.\n     C.  God is love.  Cf. 1 John 4:8,16.\n         As such, He is gracious, merciful, good, faithful,\n         patient, and full of lovingkindness.  Cf. Psa 89:1,2;\n         Psa 103:8; Nahum 1:7.\n     D.  But God is also holy and righteous.  He is absolutely\n         without sin in His nature, and so is incapable of\n         sinning in though, word, or action.  Cf. Ex. 15:11; Isa.\n         6:3.\n     E.  God is omnipresent (everywhere present at the same time\n         in the completeness of His Person), omniscient (all\n         knowing, knowing all things--the end from the beginning,\n         infinitely wise), omnipotent (almighty, sovereign, with\n         unlimited power over all creation).\n         God is infinite in His presence, wisdom, and power.  It\n         is my conviction that the work of the Lord in our day\n         has become very man-centered, and that the people in our\n         churches know very little about God.  I believe that the\n         Lord's work needs to be God-centered, and that the\n         people of God need to understand that God is sovereign\n         in all things:  in the affairs of nations, in the lives\n         of all people, and in the carrying out of His purposes\n         regarding salvation.\n\nIII.     THE WORKS OF THE GODHEAD.\n     A.  In creation\n          All Three Persons of the Godhead were active in\n          creating, and all Three are active in sustaining\n          creation, and in ordering the course of human affairs\n          (for nations as well as individual people) to the end\n          of time.  Cf. Gen. 1:1,2; John 1:1-3; Col. 1:16-17;\n          Heb. 1:3.\n     B.  In salvation\n         In order to understand salvation I believe that it is\n         absolutely necessary to begin with God, not with man. \n         All three Persons of the Godhead have been, and are,\n         active in salvation.\n         1.  God, the Father\n             Salvation originated with God.  The Members of the\n             Godhead determined in eternity past that there would\n             be salvation, the conditions under which people\n             could and would be saved, and even who would be\n             saved.  Election to salvation is recognized in\n             Scripture as the work of  God, the Father.  Cf. Eph\n             1:3-4; 2 Thess 2:13-14.\n         2.  Christ, the Son of God\n             The Lord Jesus Christ, through His birth by the\n             virgin Mary, came to the earth to accomplish two\n             important works:\n             a.   He came as the final and complete revelation of\n                  God, the Father.  Cf. Col 1:15; heb 1:1-3.\n             b.   He came to provide salvation for all whom the\n                  Father had chosen.  He did this by His death on\n                  the Cross, by His bodily resurrection, and by\n                  His present intercessory work in heaven.  The\n                  work of salvation will be completed for us when\n                  the Lord returns.  Cf. Rom 5:8-10; 1 Cor 15:3-\n                  4; Heb 7:25, 1 John 3:2.\n         3.  The Holy Spirit\n             As the Author of Scripture, the theme of which is\n             Christ and His redemptive work, the Holy Spirit is\n             carrying out the redemptive plan of God in the\n             following ways:\n             a.   He convicts of sin. Cf. John 16:7-11\n             b.   He regenerates (known in the Bible as the new\n                  birth).  Cf. John 3:5-8.\n             c.   He indwells each believer to fulfill the work\n                  of sanctification.  Cf. John 14-16-17.\n             d.   He seals every believer in Christ, thus making \n                  salvation secure.  Cf. Eph 1:13-14.\n             e.   He baptizes every believer into the body of\n                  Christ.  Cf. Cor. 12:13\n             f.   He teaches every believer the truth of\n                  Scripture. Cf. John 14:26.\n             g.   He bestows spiritual gifts on the people of \n                  God for ministry.  (Cf. 1 Cor 12\n             h.   He restrains sin.  Cf Gal 5:16-26.\n             i.   He empowers for living and for service.  \n                  Cf. Acts 1:8
I beg to disagree with the assertion that science is a collection of models.\nScientific models are a game to play, and are only as good as the\nassumptions and measurements (if any) that go into them.\n\nAs an example, I remember when nuclear winter was the big hype in\natmospheric science.  It wasn't long after Sagan's admonitions that\none of our boys was adding another level of reality into his model of\nthe nuclear winter scenario at ERL in Boulder.  He decided to assume\nthat the atmosphere is more like a two-dimensional thing, than a one-\ndimensional thing.  He also assumed that it rained and that the winds\nblow in the real atmosphere.  On returning to Georgia Tech, he showed\na transparency of atmospheric cooling rates according to the year they\nwere generated by the models.  There was an unmistakable correlation\nbetween the age (meaning simplicity of assumptions; i.e., remoteness\nfrom reality) of each model and the degree of cooling.  Whereas Sagan's\nmodel showed an approximate 40-degree cooling episode, the next model \nin sophistication showed about half that, and so on until we got to\nour boy's model, which showed a 1-2 degree drop if the war happened in\nthe winter and less than a 10 degree drop if it happened in the summer.\nHe predicted that when we would include the presence of oceans, chemistry,\nthe biosphere, and other indicators of reality in the models, we would\nprobably see even less cooling.  Thus nuclear winter was reduced to even\nless than a nuclear autumn, one might say, to a nuclear fizzle.\n\nTo quote from H.S. Yoder,\n\n	The postulated models have become accepted as the reality\n	instead of the lattice of assumptions they are.\n	Authoritarianism dominates the field, and a very critical\n	analysis of each argument is to be encouraged.... Skepticism\n	of the model approach to earth problems is warranted because\n	many key parameters have not been included.\n\nThis statement surely applies equally well to cosmogony.  Only when\nconvincing observational evidence substantiates the modeled results\nmay one suggest that the model may describe the reality.  Just thought\nI'd clear that up before things really got out of hand. \n \n-- \nboundary
Short reply:  We can never achieve perfect health, yet we always strive for it.  \nWe don't seek to do God's will because we're forced to, we follow His way \nbecause His way is best.  The reason it's hard is because we are flawed, not \nbecause He's unreasonable.  But we seek to follow His way because we want to \nimprove ourselves and our lives.

Heres a story of a Saint that people might like to read. I got it from\na The Morning Star, and am posting it with the permission of the\neditor.\n\n\n    Saint Aloysius Gonzaga\n\n    The Patron of Youth\n\n\n    The marquis Gonzaga had high aspirations for his son, the  Prince\n    Gonzage.  He  wanted  him  to become a famous, brave and honoured\n    soldier. After all, he must carry on the  great  family  name  of\n    Gonzaga.  Of  course, he was to become far more famous, brave and\n    honoured than his father could ever have imagined; though not  in\n    the manner expected.\n\n    Saint Aloysius' mother was a woman who received immense joy  from\n    praying  to  God  and  meditating on the divine mysteries and the\n    life of Our Lord. She had little time for the pleasures  of  this\n    life.  As  Saint  Aloysius	grew, he began to resemble his mother\n    more than his father.\n\n    Saint Aloysius had learned numerous expressions from his father's\n    soldiers,  but the moment he discovered that they were vulgar, he\n    fainted from shock. This shows his immense hatred of sin (What an\n    example for us of the contempt we must have for sin).\n\n    About the time of his First Holy  Communion  (which  he  received\n    from  the  Archbishop  of  Milan,  Charles Borromeo, whom himself\n    became a great Saint), he con-secrated  his  purity  to  God  and\n    asked the Blessed Virgin to protect his innocence for life.\n\n    He wanted to share Our Lord's suffering to	show  his  reciprocal\n    love.  He  started by denying his passions; he avoided eating the\n    finest foods, wearing the best clothes, and would put  pieces  of\n    wood  in his bed in order to mortify himself for the love of God.\n    While he was in his early teens his  father  sent  him  (and  his\n    younger  brother)  to  the court of the Spanish King, Phillip 11.\n    Obediently, he set out to make the best of it. He mixed  in  well\n    with  the people of the royal court, for he was handsome, polite,\n    intelligent and always had something interesting to say.\n\n\n    Not long before this time, the great soldier-saint,  Saint	Igna-\n    tius  of  Loyola,  had founded the Society of Jesus (the Jesuits)\n    towards which Saint Aloysius\n\n\n				  -12-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    began to have a yearning. When he finally told  his  father,  the\n    marquis flew into a rage and forbade his son to become a priest.\n\n    After a short time, his father sent him to the  great  cities  in\n    order that he be tempted away from the priesthood, but even\n\n    through these trials, Saint Aloysius grew in his desire  for  the\n    religious life and was strengthened in the virtue of purity.\n\n    The Marquis' plans were obviously failing, so he con-fronted  his\n    son:  "Will  you or will you not obey me and forget this foolish-\n    ness?" "I will not, father," was the  in-evitable  reply.	"Then\n    leave from my sight and don't return until you change your mind!"\n    With tears clouding his eyes, the Saint left the  room  to	pray:\n    "Tell  me Lord, what am I to do? Tell me! Tell me!" He knelt down\n    to flagellate himself as he had done several  times  before,  but\n    this  time	he was seen. The onlooker rushed to the marquis. This\n    at last brought the proud man to his senses. "The Lord wants him,\n    the Lord can have him." He gave his consent for his son to become\n    a Jesuit.\n\n    After some years (at the end of the sixteenth century), a  terri-\n    ble  epidemic  broke out in Rome. All the hospitals were full and\n    could house no more, so the Jesuits opened their own. Saint Aloy-\n    sius  did  all he could in the hospitals, particularly to prepare\n    the dying for a holy death.\n\n    Saint Aloysius himself contracted the plague  from	carrying  and\n    nursing  the  sick.  For three months he lay with a burning fever\n    and finally, on June 21st, 1591, he gave his  soul	to  the  Lord\n    while gazing at a crucifix.\n\n    Let us invoke Saint Aloysius as our patron and imitate him in his\n    humility, purity and confidence in prayer.\n\n    Saint Aloysius Gonzaga, pray for us.\n\n    - Brendan Arthur\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Prayer is as necessary to a person consecrated to the service  of\n    others as a sword is to a soldier\n\nGod Bless\n\nFrom Simon\nLines:  106
This is an annual time of prayer organized by the Focus on the Family\norganization.  If you have not heard about it on your Christian radio\nstation or at your local church, call them and they may be able to\ngive you the information.\n\nMany cities in the San Francisco bay area have local coordinators\norganizing the time and the place to meet to pray.  In San Francisco,\nOakland, Berkeley, San Jose, people will be meeting at ~12:15pm at\neach city's City Hall.\n\nLast year, I attended at the Mountain View city hall.  It was a very\nquiet and meaningful time of prayer.
Yes.\n\n(I am adamantly an environmentalist.  I will not use styrofoam table service.\nPlease keep that in mind as you read this post - I do not wish to attack\nenvironmentalism)\n\nA half truth is at least as dangerous as a complete lie.  A complete lie will\nrarely be readily accepted, while a half truth (the lie subtly hidden) is more\npowerfully offered by one who masquerades as an angel of light.\n\nSatan has (for some people) loosened the grip on treating the earth as something\nother than God's intricate handiwork, something other than that on which the\nhealth of future generations is based.  It is being treated with respect.  You\nthink he's going to happily leave it at that?  No.  When one error is rejected,\nit is his style to push people to the opposite error.  Therefore the earth is\nnot God's intricate handiwork, not because it is rubbish, but because it is\nGod.  Mother earth is the one you are to primarily love and serve.\n\nI see two facets of a response to it:\n\n1: Care for the environment.  Treat it with proper respect, both because it is\n   God's intricate handiwork and the health of future generation, and because\n   showing the facet of one who is disregardful of such things does not\n   constitute what the Apostle Paul called "becoming all things to all men so\n   that by all possible means I might save some."\n\n   Don't say "Forget the environment, I've got important things to spend my time\n   on." - putting your foot in your mouth in this manner will destroy your\n   credibility in expressing the things that _are_ more important.\n\n2: Show that it is not the ultimate entity, that it is creature and not\n   creator.  Show that its beauty and glory points to a greater beauty and\n   glory.  Show that it is not the ultimate tapestry, but one of many cords\n   woven in the infinite tapestry.
I agree we need sleep & etc, but I disagree we are _just_ animals.   \nThat statement is a categorical negative; it's like saying there are  \n_no_ polkadoted elephants.  It may be true but one would have to be  \nomniscient to know for sure.
Dear fellow netters,\n\nFrom time to time a term like 'Oneness Pentecostals' (or something\nsimilar) has occurred in posts to this group. I also know that there\nis a movement called something like 'Jesus alone.' \n\nI believe in the Trinity and have no plans to change that, but reently\nI was made aware that there is at least one person within our church\nwho holds the view that there is no trinity. In the near future we\nwill discuss this item, and I feel that I shall ask you, my friends on\nthis group, for background information.\n\nCan anybody tell me the basic reasons for holding a belief that there\nis only Jesus? And vice versa: The foundations for the Trinity?\n\nI shall appreciate both quotes from the Bible and historical\ndevelopment.\n\nThank you all.\n\nIn Him,\n\nBjorn
Praise God!  I'm writing everyone to inform you that I have been\naccepted to the Doctor of Psychology program at Fuller Theological\nSeminary in Pasadena, CA.  I've been working long and hard to try to\nget in there and have said many hours of prayer.  I'm very excited for\nthis opportunity, but also very nervous about it.\n\nI'd appreciate the prayers of the readers of this group for my preparation\nfor school this summer and for my career as a graduate student.  I'd also\nappreciate any information any of the readers of this group might have \nabout Fuller, Pasadena, or California in general, like good places to\nhave fun, good churches to check out, or anything else that might be\ngood for me to know.  Also, if anyone knows of any foundations that \nmight have funding or scholarship money available, please let me know!\nOf course, if you wish to make a personal contribution.....:)\n\nThe contract for my current job is over at the end of April.  I'll be\ntaking a couple classes at UT this summer and then I'll be moving to\nPasadena.  Hopefully, I'll be able to get net.access next fall, although\nFuller doesn't have it itself.\n\nI've enjoyed the interesting discussions and I commend everyone for their\nearnest search to please God.

[good points on buddhism, etc. deleted]\n\njust because one says christianity -- true christianity -- is hard to\nfollow faithfully does NOT mean that one discounts the validity and\ndifficulty of other religions.  i admire those of any religion who are\nwilling to make the kind of sacrifices and dedicate themselves\nspiritually in the way you are talking about. \n\n[more deleted]\n\ndo you think this is what christianity is all about?  not all\nchristians believe in this particular story literally.  it sounds\nabove like you are supporting a policy of "to each his own" -- here is\nanother example of that.  if it helps someone's faith to take every\nword of the bible literally, i support and respect that, too.\n\n\nplease don't judge all of christianity by one man.  the only man one\ncan truly judge all of christianity by is jesus (makes sense, right?).\n\ni think his point about how we put our lives into little boxes is very\ntrue -- what does your comment about robertson have to do with that?\n\n\n\ni was raised agnostic -- my father was never baptised and was raised\natheist.  he is not an atheist because he found a close-mindedness\npresent in the viewpoint of his parents equal to the close-mindedness\nhe found in the viewpoint of the christians he came in contact with.\nthus i was _free_ to choose how to live my life, and he supported the\ndecision i made to join the episcopal church, although he emphasized\nto me that his respect for my beliefs should result in my not\nintruding on his beliefs, ie, i should not try to convert him, as that\nis his decision.  (please, no flames or advice on how to convert him!)\none of my good friends is hindi and i greatly respect her\nbeliefs and the culture surrounding her religion.  my best friend is\njewish and i have always held a profound resepct for the jewish\nreligion (chaim potok and isaac bashevis singer are two of my favorite\nauthors).  i really do not think you can make that kind of\ngeneralization about how christians choose -- and i do mean CHOOSE--\ntheir faith.  if they have not consciously accepted the faith in their\nadult lives (which is what confirmation represents), THEN you can talk\nabout their being brainwashed.
I would like the opinion of netters on a subject that has been bothering my\nwife and me lately: liturgy, in particular, Catholic liturgy.  In the last few\nyears it seems that there are more and more ad hoc events during Mass.  It's\ndriving me crazy!  The most grace-filled aspect of a liturgical tradition is\nthat what happens is something we _all_ do together, because we all know how to \ndo it.  Led by the priest, of course, which makes it a kind of dialogue we \npresent to God.  But the best Masses I've been to were participatory prayers.\n\nLately, I think the proportion of participation has fallen, and the proportion\nof sitting there and watching, or listening, or generally being told what to do\n(which is necessary because no one knows what's happening next) is growing.\nExample.  Last Sunday (Palm Sunday) we went to the local church.  Usually\non Palm Sunday, the congregation participates in reading the Passion, taking\nthe role of the mob.  The theology behind this seems profound--when we say\n"Crucify him" we mean it.  We did it, and if He came back today we'd do it\nagain.  It always gives me chills.  But last week we were "invited" to sit\nduring the Gospel (=Passion) and _listen_.  Besides the Orwellian "invitation", \nI was really saddened to have my (and our) little role taken away.  This seems\ntypical of a shift of participation away from the people, and toward the\nmusicians, readers, and so on.  New things are introduced in the course of the\nliturgy and since no one knows what's happening, the new things have to be\nexplained, and pretty soon instead of _doing_ a lot of the Mass we're just\nsitting there listening (or spacing out, in my case) to how the Mass is about\nto be done.  In my mind, I lay the blame on liturgy committees made up of lay\n"experts", but that may not be just.  I do think that a liturgy committee has a\nbias toward doing something rather than nothing--that's just a fact of\nbureaucratic life--even though a simpler liturgy may in fact make it easier for\npeople to be aware of the Lord's presence.\n\nSo we've been wondering--are we the oddballs, or is the quality of the Mass\ngoing down?  I don't mean that facetiously.  We go to Mass every Thursday or\nFriday and are reminded of the power of a very simple liturgy to make us aware \nof God's presence.  But as far as the obligatory Sunday Masses...maybe I should \njust offer it up :)  Has anyone else noticed declining congregational\nparticipation in Catholic Masses lately?
In many places, Christians were sucessful in their attempts\nto get the films banned, or at least given a very restrictive \nshowing.\n\nI have no problem with Christians burning their own pieces of\nart (though I find it a tragic waste). I do however have a \nproblem with their attempts to censor what I may or may not\nview.\n\nP.
No one was ever flogged, beaten, burned, fed to the lions, or killed in any\nother way because of a belief in the resurrection - sorry to disappoint you.\nThe idea of resurrection is one which can be found in a host of different\nforms in the religions of antiquity.  The problem was not the resurrection\nwhich was a mediorce issue for a tiny fragment of the Jewish population \n(the Saducees) but was a non issues for everyone else.  The real problem was\nthat Christians were pacifist and preached there was only one god.  When the\nstate operates by a system of divinitation of the emperor -  monotheism \nbecomes a capital offense.  The Jews were able to get exemption from this,\nand were also not evangelistic.  Christians were far more vocal, and gentile,\nand hence dangerous and were therefore targets of persecution.  Also since\nChristians were a relatively powerless group, they made good scapegoats as is\nseen by Nero's blaming them for the burning of Rome.  Let's not cloud the\nissues with the resurrection.\n\nrandy
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nI've always taken Murphy's Law to be an exhortation to prudence, and\nan observation about the behavior of complex systems, rather than a\ndenial of divine benevolence.
One of the things I find intersting about pagan beliefs is\ntheir belief in a feminine deity as well as a masculine deity. Being\nbrought up in a Christian household, I often wondered if there was God\nthe Father, where was the mother? Everyone I know who has a father\nusually as a mother. It just seemed rather unbalanced to me. \n	Fortunately, my own personal theology, which will probably not\nfall into line with a lot others, recognized God as a being both\nwithout gender and posessing qualities of both genders, as being both\na masculine and feminine force. It provides a sense of balance I find\nsorely lacking in most theologies, a lack which I think is responsible\nfor a lot of the unbalanced ways in which we see the world and treat\neach other.
Hello, I'm back..\n\nI would first like to thank each and every person who sent me a response (be\nit a positive or negative one). I read EVERY letter and thought about \neach one!! \n\nI got all sorts of responses, from "marry her" to "have nothing ever to \ndo with her again"\n\nThrough reading the Bible and through a lot of prayer, here is what I have\ndecided to do.\n\nI sent her a letter today. First, i told her that if she was really serious\nabout moving away from home to another state that "I would do anything to \nget you here in NC." I told her that I tried to find out if there were \nany new stores planning to be built---but they wouldn't tell me.\n\nAbout her marraige comment (I'm not gonna call it a proposal, cause\nI still don't know if it was a total joke or not) I more or less said\nthat "Marry me?? Well, get transferred to NC first and then we'll talk :) :)"\n\nHopefully, what i said could be interpreted either way.\n\nNeedless to say, there has been a lot of praying over this...I \nhave done a lot of reading about marraige from the Bible. If\nshe was dead serious about getting married---I wouldn't do it\nyet simply b/c she is not (as far as I know to this point) a Christian.\nIt just wouldn't work w/o God in the marraige as well. I figure\nthat if God wanrs this to go through--he's kept us in touch for 10 \nyears now---he can handle one more. If God wants it to happen, it\nwill happen!\n\nShe will be in NC in June meetinf some relatives so I'll get to \nsee her...and I'll get a letter from her befoe then so I know\nmore of what to look forward to.\n\nI guess all I can do now is wait and pray. I have decided not to tell\nmy folks until I'm totally sure what is going on.\n\nI do ask that everyone that wrote me to please keep this situation\nin your prayers..\n\nFinally, I would like to thank EVERYONE who wrote in...\n\nIf you have anything else for me...I will be at this email address\nfor one week. Please tell me anyhting you want...I'm curious\nhow folks think about what i did.\n\n\nThanx
Good point -- it is very true that these "false" predictions are\ndangerous--we are warned (more than once) in scripture about false prophtets.\n\n	However, as is often the case with other issues, one cannot let those\nwho falsly report such "visions" as a reason against believing in any of them\n(I did not get the impression you were asserting this, by the way...I consider\nmy response not so much a response to your posting but a response to the topic\nas a whole).\n\n	Example:  The Appearances of Mary at Fatima, Portugal in 1917.\n\n	Among other things, she predicted the conversion of Russia to Atheism\n	(something that happened less than a year later w/ the Bolshevik\n	revolution).  She also predicted the second world war (that is, predicte	predicted that it would occur during the papacy of a certain pope, who\n	was not the current one.  It happened just like she said.)\n\n	She warned there would be "fire in the sky" as a warning that the \n	second world war was about to start.  About a week before Germany\n	invaded, weathermen (and women, I suppose) all over Europe, from\n	England to Spain to Eastern Europe, reported the most spectacular\n	reddish color in the sky ever recorded.  To this day some try to \n	explain it off as the northern lights, and the relation to Mary's\n	prediction simply coincidence.  You all can decide for yourselves.\n\n	Mary predicted that the Atheistic Russia would spread her evils all\n	over the world and persecute religion.  \n\n	She said many other things as well, too numerous to list here.  Every\n	single one has been realized.  	One can only use the term "coincidence"\n	so many times in the same explanation before its use becomes \n	ridiculous.  \n\n	SO...yes, there are many false prophets and many false reports. There\n	are true ones, too.  We must always remain open to that.  Fatima was\n	one example.  There is another one, currently occuring--the \n	apparitions that have been taking place at Medjurgorje, Yugoslavia\n	(or whatever its called now).  Mary has been appearing every day for\n	eleven years now.  It's time the world started listening.
: I may be wrong, but wasn't Jeff Fenholt part of Black Sabbath?  He's a\n: MAJOR brother in Christ now.  He totally changed his life around, and\n: he and his wife go on tours singing, witnessing, and spreading the\n: gospel for Christ.  I may be wrong about Black Sabbath, but I know he\n: was in a similar band if it wasn't that particular group...\n\n   Yes, but Jeff also speaks out against listening to bands like Black\nSabbath. He says they're into all sorts of satanic stuff. I don't know.
I simply wish to thank Dave Mielke (dave@bnr.ca)  for sharing the\ntract concerning God's love.  It was most welcome to me and a great\nsource of comfort.
A section of Richard Badenas' book, "Christ The End of the Law, Romans 10.14 \nin Pauline Perspective."  The section I have is on the Contextual setting and \nmeaning of Romans 9-11.  In addition, there are 111 endnotes.\n\nSince the file is so long, and because of other reasons, I will take requests\nfor the article personally.\n\nOf course, I believe Badenas' insights to be true, and, quite damaging to the\ntraditional Augustinian/Calvinist view.
I no longer have the textbook, but abstinence was defined as something\nlike "no contact between the penis and the vagina, vulva, or area \nimmediately surrounding the vulva, and no transfer of semen to the\nvagina, vulva, or area surrounding the vulva".  \n\nThat is, abstinence wasn't discussed as "sex outside of marriage is\nmorally wrong" but as keep  the sperm away from the ovum and conception \nis impossible. The moral question I recall the teacher asking was,\n"is it okay to create a child if you aren't able to be a good parent\nyet?"\n\n-jen\n\n--
Peir-Yuan Yeh asks:\n\nsame >or part of them are the same?  How about Torah? Are the first five\nbooks >of OT as the same as Torah?????\n\nYes, yes, and yes.  Jewish history as recorded in the Old Testament and\nas shown by archaeology are the same.  Kings, revivals, Temples, and all.\n\nThe Torah, as far as I know, is the five books of Moses.  Then come the\nProphets (all the Prophets, plus Joshua, Judges, 1&2 Samuel, 1&2 Kings)\nand the Writings (Psalms, Proverbs, Lamentations, Ruth, Esther, Ezra,\nNehemiah, Ecclesiates, Song of Songs, 1&2 Chronicles, Job).\n\nAnd the veracity of Isaiah, which you quoted to your Moslem friend is\nquite well known.  A complete manuscript exists that dates back to past\n200 BC, and is kept in a Museum in Israel.  It was found among the Dead\nSea Scrolls, which greatly enhanced our knowledge of the veracity of the\nOld Testament, as they date back to around the time of Christ, whereas\nbefore, the oldest complete manuscript in Hebrew was from around 900 AD.\n\nYour Moslem friend is sorely mistaken, but understandably so.  If Jesus\nwas crucified, and atoned for our sins, he must have been God, for only\nthe death of God could atone for the sins of all humanity.  And as\nIsaiah predicts, the messiah will be called "the mighty God."  And if he\nwas God, then he must have rose, for as St. Paul wrote, it was not\npossible that death could hold him.  And if Jesus rose from the dead,\nyour Moslem friend would have little reason to be a Moslem.  Which is\nwhy he denies the authenticity of the Old Testament.
One can feel physical pain by having a body, which, if you know the\ndoctrine of the resurrection of the body, is what people will have after\nthe great judgement.  "We look for the resurrection of the dead, and the\nlife of the world to come."  - Nicene-Constantinopolitan Creed.  You\nwill have both body and soul in hell - eventually.
Golgotha the whole process of the fall of man\n\nThis was precisely my point.  From a theological bent, those who lived\nimmediately after the flood, such as Noah, Ham, his son Cush, and his son\nNimrod had a much stronger appreciation of Divine wrath.  They also had a\nstronger understanding of the True God.  In fact, this immediacy was a cause of\nhardship for some, so much so that Atlas, who is seen with heavens resting on\nhis shoulders.  But this is not merely the physical heavens that he is lifting.\n It is to put God and the strict spirituality of His law at a distance, and\nthus he became the "Elevator of the heavens."  This "god" made men able to\n"feel" as if heaven were afar off and "as if either the God of Heaven could not\nsee through the dark cloud, or did not regard with displeasure the breakers of\nHis laws."  It is interesting to see that it was that was titled "Emancipator"\nor "Deliverer"  or Phoroneus. It was Nimrod who invaded the patriarchal system\nand abridged the liberties of mankind, yet was worship for having given many\nbenefits.  He was a deliverer all right but not as we think of Christ as a\nDeliverer.  One delivered from a conscious feeling of God's wrath, the other\nactually performed a delivery from Gods wrath and it is up to us to accept it\nas true.\n\n\nI don't see the problem.  From the time of Adam, those who looked forward to\nthe coming "Anointed One" and put their faith in the fact that it was God who\nwas to do the provision, were accounted as righteous.  But up to the\nCrucifixion, their sins were only covered, not taken away.  Therefore, the\ndispensation of the Church views the accountability of sin the same, but see it\nas a completed action.  Rom's makes it clear that it has always been salvation\nvia faith and nothing else.\n\n\nI understand what you're trying to convey, but I don't think I'd lay hold of it\nbecause the scriptures do equate the eternality of the second death with the\neternality of, say the Church ruling with Christ.  Jn 17 tells us what eternal\nlife is exactly, as you are correct that it is much more than non-cessation of\nconsciousness.  \n\n\nIt depends upon your def of "lost."  The elect were lost only in time as\noutside of time they had been chosen from the foundation of the world. \nExistentially we were all born "lost", but the "righteous" were "in Christ" and\ntherefore never *assuredly* lost.  \n\nMaybe this summer I could find time to put together a paper on it.  I simply\nhave to buy more books for myself, and these older books are very expensive. \nEither that or countless trips to the oriental museum.\n\n\nCouldn't agree with you more.  Our understanding, of say eschatology, is\nclearly clearer than that of, say Isaiah.  But that is not what I was referring\nto.\n\n\n\nNo, I understand it as you have said. This was my point.\n\n\nAh!  This is it.  This is the big question.  However, I would say, again I\nthink, that the best lie is one that has an appreciable amount of truth to it. \nLook at Satan's twist of God's Word when he coerced Eve.  That is a very\ninteresting study.\n\n >The similarity in the midst of great variety of\n\nYes, that is my point.  But it is a two edged sword. For some do not want the\nunderlying reality to be revealed.  They were not known as "mystery" religions\nfor no reason.  There was the public side of them and there was the private\nside, that was so protected that the initiates to an oath of death if they\nrevealed that private side.  That is why it is so hard to bring their teachings\nto light. The "Mystery of Iniquity" that we find in the Bible, correlates to\nthis I think.  The primary object of the mysteries was to introduce privately,\nlittle by little, under the seal of secrecy and sanction of oath, what it would\nnot have been safe to openly profess was the true religion.  Case in point\ntoday might be the Masons.  (Just a note, that they too worshipped Osiris in\nEgypt, who can be traced to Nimrod, the "husband son.")\n\n\nNo, I disagree with you here Gerry.  I know what you're alluding to in that the\nchurch, primarily the RCC, did endorse Aristotelian philosophy into their\nworldview, but I would disagree with you that it originated in Greece.  If you\nare a student of history, you will come to see that much of what Greece came to\nexpound to the world as their original, was just an adulteration of that which\nthey had taken from conquered countries.  The soul is clearly mentioned and\ndiscussed at length in the Egyptian religions. As was the unity of God and also\nthe trinity of God.  See if you can find Wilkinson's "Egyptians."  He really\ndoes a number on what the Greeks did to what they "pilfered" from the\nEgyptians. \n\n\nI'm not knocking Aristotle or Plato or any other Greek thinker.  Its just that\n"there is nothing new under the sun."
Can a theist be truly objective?  Can he be impartial\n     when questioning the truth of his scriptures, or\n     will he assume the superstition of his parents\n     when questioning? \n\nI've often found it to be the case that the theist\n     will stick to some kind of superstition when\n     wondering about God and his scriptures.  I've\n     seen it in the Christian, the Jew, the Muslim,\n     and the other theists alike.  All assume that\n     their mothers and fathers were right in the\n     aspect that a god exists, and with that belief\n     search for their god.\n     \nOccasionally, the theist may switch religions or\n     aspects of the same religion, but overall the\n     majority keep to the belief that some "Creator"\n     was behind the universe's existence.  I've\n     known Muslims who were once Christians and vice\n     versa, I've known Christians who were once\n     Jewish and vice versa, and I've even known\n     Christians who become Hindu.  Yet, throughout\n     their transition from one faith to another,\n     they've kept this belief in some form of higher\n     "being."  Why?\n     \nIt usually all has to do with how the child is\n     brought up.  From the time he is born, the\n     theist is brought up with the notion of the\n     "truth" of some kind of scripture-- the Bible,\n     the Torah, the Qur'an, & etc.  He is told\n     of this wondrous God who wrote (or inspired)\n     the scripture, of the prophets talked about in\n     the scripture, of the miracles performed, & etc.\n     He is also told that to question this (as\n     children are apt to do) is a sin, a crime\n     against God, and to lose belief in the scrip-\n     ture's truth is to damn one's soul to Hell.\n     Thus, by the time he is able to read the\n     scripture for himself, the belief in its "truth"\n     is so ingrained in his mind it all seems a\n     matter of course.\n     \nBut it doesn't stop there.  Once the child is able\n     to read for himself, there is an endeavor to\n     inculcate the child the "right" readings of\n     scripture, to concentrate more on the pleasant\n     readings, to gloss over the worse ones, and to\n     explain away the unexplainable with "mystery."\n     Circular arguments, "self-evdent" facts and\n     "truths," unreasoning belief, and fear of\n     hell is the meat of religion the child must eat\n     of every day.  To doubt, of course, means wrath\n     of some sort, and the child must learn to put\n     away his brain when the matter concerns God.\n     All of this has some considerable effect on the\n     child, so that when he becomes an adult, the \n     superstitions he's been taught are nearly\n     impossible to remove.\n     \nAll of this leads me to ask whether the theist can\n     truly be objective when questioning God, Hell,\n     Heaven, the angels, souls, and all of the rest.\n     Can he, for a moment, put aside this notion that\n     God *does* exist and look at everything from\n     a unbiased point of view?  Obviously, most\n     theists can somewhat, especially when presented\n     with "mythical gods" (Homeric, Roman, Egyptian,\n     & etc.).  But can they put aside the assumption\n     of God's existence and question it impartially?\n     \nStephen\n\n    _/_/_/_/  _/_/_/_/   _/       _/    * Atheist\n   _/        _/    _/   _/ _/ _/ _/     * Libertarian\n  _/_/_/_/  _/_/_/_/   _/   _/  _/      * Pro-individuality\n       _/  _/     _/  _/       _/       * Pro-responsibility\n_/_/_/_/  _/      _/ _/       _/ Jr.    * and all that jazz...\n\n--
The quick answer:  Revelation 12:7-9\n\n	"And there was war in heaven.  Michael and his angels fought against\n	the dragon and his angels who fought back.  But he [the dragon] was\n	not strong enough, and they lost their place in heaven.  The great\n	dragon was hurled down--that ancient serpent, called the devil and\n	Satan, who leads the whole world astray.  He was hurled down to the\n	earth, and his angels with him."\n\n	The earlier part of chapter 12 deals (very symbolically) with why\n	Satan rose up in battle against Michael and the good angels in the\n	first place.
: [ The discussion begins: why does the universe exist at all?  ]\n \n: One of the Laws of Nature, specifying cause and effect seems to dictate \n: (at least to this layman's mind) there must be a causal event.  No\n: reasonable alternative exists.\n\nI would argue that causality is actually a property of spacetime; \ncauses precede their effects. But if you claim that there must be\nan answer to "how" did the universe (our spacetime)  emerge from \n"nothing", science has some good candidates for an answer.\n\nI have always wondered why Christians use the "There are questions\nscience (or atheism) cannot answer" argument; I hope this is the\nappropriate group to ask this question.\n\nThe most popular question is the question of origins. Why does the\nuniverse exist, or anything, for that matter?\n\nI think this question should actually be split into two parts, namely\n\n1) Why is there existence? Why anything exists?\n\nand\n\n2) How did the universe emerge from nothing?\n\nIt is clear science has nothing to say about the first question. However,\nis it a meaningful question, after all?\n\nI would say it isn't. Consider the following:\n\nA die-hard skeptic being (be it human or whatever) attempts to doubt\none's very existence. Since it is so easy to doubt everything else -\nI cannot be _sure_ the world exists, it may be my mind fooling me -\ncan I ever be sure I exist?\n\nHowever, it is only possible to exist or not to exist. (Someone\ninsert an appropriate Shakespeare quote here ;-) )\n\nA being that does not exist cannot doubt one's existence.\nA being that does exist can doubt one's existence, but this would be\npointless - the being would exist anyway.\n\nLet us return to the original question: why? A being that does not\nexist does not need any reasons for its non-existence. This being\nis not _sure_ whether anything else exists but his mind, but let\nus assume that the world exists independent of the mind (the objectivity\npostulate). The question "why anything exists" can be countered by\ndemanding answer to a question "why there is nothing in nothingness,\nor in non-existence". Actually, both questions turn out to be\ndevoid of meaning. Things that exist do, and things that don't exist\ndon't exist. Tautology at its best.\n\nI seriously doubt God could have an answer to this question.\n\nSome Christians I have talked to have said that actually, God is\nHimself the existence. However, I see several problems with this\nanswer. First, it inevitably leads to the conclusion that God is\nactually _all_ existence, good and evil, devils and angels, us and\nthem. This is pantheism, not Christianity.\n\nAnother answer is that God is the _source_ of all existence.\nThis sounds much better, but I am tempted to ask: Does God\nHimself exist, then? If God is the source of His own existence,\nit can only mean that He has, in terms of human time, always\nexisted. But this is not the same as the source of all existence.\nThis argument sounds like God does not exist, but meta-exists,\nand from His meta-existent perspective, He created existence.\nI think this is actually a nonsolution, a mere twist of words.\n\nThe best answer I have heard is that human reasoning is incapable\nof understanding such questions. Being an atheist myself, I do not\naccept such answers, since I do not have any other methods.\n\nThe second question: How did the universe emerge from nothing?\nbelongs to the domain of science, and I, for one, do not doubt the\nquestion can be answered by its methods. Many cosmologists have\nsuggested that it is entirely possible for universes to emerge\nfrom vacuum (this possibility has been suggested in a recent\nHawking biography; see also Lizhi & Shuxian: Creation of the Universe,\nWorld Scientific, 1989). However, I think the sci groups are more\nappropriate for discussions like this.\n \n: As far as I can tell, the very laws of nature demand a "why".  That isn't\n: true of something outside of nature (i.e., *super*natural).\n\nThis is not true. Science is a collection of models telling us "how",\nnot why, something happens. I cannot see any good reason why the "why"\nquestions would be bound only to natural things, assuming that the\nsupernatural domain exists. If supernatural beings exist, it is\nas appropriate to ask why they do so as it is to ask why we exist.\n \n: I believe the "genetic code" will be entirely deciphered in our lifetimes,\n: but we will not see man convert entirely inert material into self sustaining, \n: reproducing life, *ever*.  (I've never been much of a prophet, though. I\n: can't even *picture* New York in my mind 8^] ).  I don't believe *any*\n: technology would be able to produce that necessary *spark* of life, despite\n: having all of the parts available. Just my opinion.\n\nThis opinion is also called vitalism; namely, that living systems are\nsomehow _fundamentally_ different from inanimate systems. Do Christians\nin general adopt this position? What would happen when scientists announce\nthey have created primitive life (say, small bacteria) in a lab?\n\nThere is a problem with your prophecy: artificial life has been created,\nalthough not yet in a chemical form. Computer simulations of evolution\ncontain systems that are as much alive as any bacterium, although\ntheir code is electronic, as well as their metabolism. See a recent book\n\nSteven Levy: Artificial life - The Quest for a New Creation. Jonathan\nCape, London 1992.\n\nArtificial chemical life is just around the corner - after all, no \nspark of life has been found to be necessary; living systems do not\nviolate any physical laws as we know them. \n\n: You don't mind if a few of us send up a prayer on your behalf during your\n: research, do you?  After all, if we of Christ are deluding ourselves, you\n: really have nothing to worry about, eh?\n\nExactly. This is why I think atheists should _not_ post any evangelical\natheist arguments to soc.religion groups, since people who seek to \nfind peace in religions must be allowed to gather together. I would\nnormally have asked these questions in alt.atheism or talk.religion.misc,\nbut it seems many Christians do not read these groups. \n\nPetri

That is not necessarily unorthodox.  When Christians call God 'Father', \nwe are using a metaphor.  The Bible in one place refers to God as being\nlike a mother.  God is neither a father nor a mother in the literal\nsense; God has some of the attributes of both; the father metaphor is\nusually used because (for most people at most times) it is the less\nmisleading of the two possibilities.
(Dean and I write lots and lots about absolute truth and arrogance.)\n\n\nI agree that we'll probably never agree, and I'm starting to feel \nfrustrated, and I'm tired of having my conversations with my husband \ndominated by this topic (just kidding, :-)).\n\nI do have to say, though, that participating in this discussion has been\na good learning experience for me.  My views on this topic have evolved\nand clarified through this, and I suspect that we may not disagree as \nmuch as we think. \n\nI admit that I'm strongly prejudiced against evangelical Christianity,\nand I may not always be rational in my reactions to it.  I grew up\nin EC, and went to an EC college.  It was definitely the wrong place\nfor me, and I react strongly to any implication that EC or conservative\nChristianity has any sort of stronghold on true Christianity.  I shudder \nwhen I remember the condescending attitude I had about other Christians \nwho didn't adhere to the EC model.\n\nI have come to see that my real objection to this whole notion of \nabsolute truth is the actions I have seen it lead to.  I have had some \nvery bad experiences with evangelical Christians claiming to know the \ntruth, and judging me or others based on their belief that they have \nthe answers.  Knowing the truth doesn't seem to leave a whole lot of \nroom for others' opinions.\n\nI can accept your belief in absolute truth as long as you* don't try to \nuse that belief to try to force others to comply with it, and you are \nvery careful that you don't hurt others with it.  Love your neighbor \nseems to go totally out the window when one knows the truth and believes \nthat everyone should be living by that truth.  Other people have \nconvictions about the truth every bit as strong and sincere as yours, \nbased on careful searching, prayer, and their relationship with God.  \nDon't dismiss them because God didn't lead them to the same conclusions \nas yours.\n\n*This is not directed personally at you, Dean.
davem@bnr.ca (Dave Mielke) writes,\n\n \n  \nI am extremely uncomfortable with this way of phrasing it.  God's love \nis unconditional, unqualified, unfathomable.  We are capable of \nrejecting God's love but He never fails to love us.\n\nThese verses do not show that God's love is qualified but rather that He \nis opposed to evil.\n\nI am uncomfortable with the tract in general because there seems to be \nan innappropriate emphasis on Hell.  God deserves our love and worship \nbecause of who He is.  I do not like the idea of frightening people into \naccepting Christ.  \n\nI see evangelism as combining a way of living that shows God's love with \nputting into words and explaining that love.  Preaching the Gospel \nwithout living the Gospel is no better than being a noisy gong or a \nclanging cymbal.\n\nHere's a question:  How many of you are Christians because you are \nafraid of going to Hell?  How many are responding to God's love?
{I sent in something on this before but I believe it got lost in the\nweekend accident the moderator described.  This is an improved\nversion anyway so no loss the first time.  HL}\n\nThe standard work on detecting forgeries of ancient documents \nis probably the writing of Friedrich Blass, "Hermeneutrik und \nKritik," _Einleitende und Hilfsdisziplinen_, vol 1 of\n_Handbuch der Klassischen Altertums- wissenshaft_ (Noerdlingen:\nBeck, 1886).  Portions of this are described in Nibley, _The \nProphetic Book op Mormon_, pp 219-242 (SLC:  Deseret Book, 1989).\n(If you want to attempt reading this be forewarned.  Nibley\ndescribes Blass as a typical German scholar who claims little\nknowledge of his subject, then proceeds to exhaust both the subject\nand the reader.)  Nibley's extract from Blass's work is in the form\nof "rules for forgers."  It makes interesting reading.\n\nI confess that I have not read Blass's work, only Nibley's extract\nthereof.  My German falls far short of what would be required and\nas far as I know there is no English translation available.  However,\nI believe the techniques he describes are known widely enough that \nany competent classical scholar could examine a purportedly ancient\ndocument and at least determine if it is consistent with what one \nwould expect of a genuine document of that time frame.  We will not \nbe able to prove who wrote it but at least we should be able to \ndetermine with reasonable confidence if it is from that time and \nculture or is a later forgery.\n\nActually there are 2 types of purportedly ancient documents:\n\n1.  Alleged actual holographs or early copies thereof.  For example\nthe Dead Sea Scrolls.  These can be tested by various scientific\nmeans to determine the age of the paper, inks, and objects found\nwith them.  This can provide a pretty clear dating of the actual\nphysical objects.\n\n2.  Documents claiming to be copies of ancient works although the\ncopy itself may be much more recent.  For example we might find a\ndocument which monks in a monastary claim is a copy of something\nfrom centuries ago (perhaps even having been through several\ngenerations of copists).  This is more of a problem but can still \nbe tested (although the test is not likely to be simple).  We cannot\nexpect a test of the age of the physical objects to tell us much so\nwe must confine our testing to the text itself.\n\nIt is important to remember that none of these tests can tell us if\nthe document is really what it claims to be.  They can only date the\ndocument and identify its culture of origin.  For example I've heard\nof a letter supposed to have been written by Jesus himself to a king\nin what is now Iraq.  If this document were to actually turn up\nscholars could date the paper and ink (assuming they have the\nholograph).  They could check the language, content and writing\nstyle to see if they are consistent with what would be expected of a\nPalestinian Jew of that time.  However even if all test results were\npositive there is no way to determine if Jesus himself actually\nwrote it.  We would know what time and culture it came from but\n(barring a known sample of Jesus handwriting or other clues for \ncomparison) scholarship must stop there.  There is seldom any way to\ndetermine who the actual author was.\n\nAs I say, I'm no expert on Blas's work.  I do remember some of the\ntests which can be applied to alleged copies of ancient works.  \nSpecifically we might ask:\n\n1.  Is the document internally consistent?  Does it contradict\nitself?  If the work it is short it would be relatively easy to \nmaintain internal consistency, even if it is a forgery.  The \nlonger the forgery the more difficult it is to maintain consistency.\nFor this reason most successful forgers stick to short documents.\n\n2.  Is it consistent with the history and geography of the time?\nAgain a short, non-specific work might not be testable but if the\nwriting is of any significant length no latter-day forger would be\nable to escape detection.  Here we look for the minor, inconspicuous\nthings which someone from that culture would get right without even\nthinking about it but which a later forger would find too numerous \nand trivial to check.  The devil is in the details.\n\n3.  What about the literary style of the work, figures of speech\netc.  Any ancient writer would almost certainly speak in ways that \nseem strange to us.  Are there any such odd phrases in this book?  \nIf so do they fit in with the culture?\n\nOf course there are complications if the document has been\ntranslated, or possibly even if somebody just updated language\nwhen he copied it.  A few cases of language not from the culture\nclaimed may be allowed in recent copies.  They cause problems and\nreduce certainty to be sure but don't necessarily prove forgery.\n\nThese tests can be quite effective (given enough material to work \nwith) but they are not easy.  They require the skills of the \nhistorian, the linguist, the anthropologist etc.  The questions to \nask are, "Is every aspect of this document consistent with what we \nknow about the culture of claimed origin?"  If there are things \nwhich don't fit how significant are they?  Are problem areas due to\nour lack of knowledge, later changes by copists or are they really \nsignificant?  There will often be some ambiguity since we never\nknow everything about the culture.

Let me carry that a step further.  Most doctors would not claim to be \ninfallible.  Indeed, they would generally admit that they could conceivably\nbe wrong, e.g. that in this case, a blood tranfusion might not turn out to \nbe necessary after all.  However, the doctors would have enough confidence\nand conviction to claim, out of genuine concern, that is IS necessary.  As\nfallible human beings, they must acknowledge the possibility that they are\nwrong.  However, they would also say that such doubts are not reasonable,\nand stand by their convictions.

note: i am not the original poster, i am just answering because i\nthink this is important.\n\n[evil result of human sinfulness, rather than the will of God]\n\nwhoo.  i'm going to have to be very careful with my language here.  i\nthink God is voluntarily giving up his omniscience in this world so\nthat we can decide on our own where we go -- free will.  in this sense\nGod allows evil to occur, and in this sense can be "held responsible"\nas my chaplain says.  however, his will is, of course, that all be\nsaved.  he's not going to save us "by himself" -- we have to take a\nstep in his direction before he will save us.  read that last sentence\ncarefully -- i'm not saying we save ourselves.  i'm saying we have to\nACCEPT our salvation.  i do not believe in predestination -- it would\nappear from what you say further down that you do.  \n\n[stuff deleted]\n\nok -- i have trouble with that, but i guess that's one of those things\nthat can't be resolved by argument.  i accept your interpretation.\n\n[more deleted]\n			     ^^^^^^^^^\nthis is what indicates to me that you may believe in predestination.\nam i correct?  i do not believe in predestination -- i believe we all\nchoose whether or not we will accept God's gift of salvation to us.\nagain, fundamental difference which can't really be resolved.\n\n[yet more deleted]\n\nyes, it is up to God to judge.  but he will only mete out that\npunishment at the last judgement.  as for now, evil can be done by\nhuman beings that is NOT God's will -- and the best we can do is see\ntaht some good comes out of it somehow.  the thing that most worries\nme about the "it is the will of God" argument is that this will\nconvince people that we should not STOP the rape and killing when i\nthink that it is most christ-like to do just that.  if jesus stopped\nthe stoning of an adulterous woman (perhaps this is not a good\nparallel, but i'm going to go with it anyway), why should we not stop\nthe murder and violation of people who may (or may not) be more\ninnocent?
First, I thank collectively all people who have given good answers\nto my questions. In my follow-up to Jason Smith's posting, I will\naddress some issues that have caused misunderstanding:\n\n\n\n\nYes, to some degree. There was an excellent discussion in sci.skeptic\non the nature of scientific work two weeks ago, I hope it did not\nescape your notice. \n\nThe correct word is 'likely'. There is no way to be sure our models and\ntheories are absolutely correct. Theories are backed up by evidence,\nbut not proved - no theory can be 'true' in a mathematical sense.\n\nHowever, theories are not mere descriptions or rationalisations of\nphenomena. It is extremely important to test whether theories can\n_predict_ something new or not yet observed. All successful theories\nscience has come up with have passed this test, including the Big\nBang theory of cosmic evolution, the theory of natural selection etc.\nIt does not mean they _must_ be correct, but they are not mere\n'best fits' for the data. \n\n\n\nWell, yes, if you want to _believe_ in them. This is not what science\nrequires - take a good look at the theory and the evidence, see if\nthe theory has made any successful predictions, and use your reason.\nDisbelievers are not punished. \n\n\nThis is what puzzles me - why do we need to have faith in _anything_?\nMy fellow atheists would call me a weak atheist - someone who is\nunable to believe, ie, fails to entertain any belief in God. \n\nYes, I know that one can't believe without God's help; Luther makes\nthis quite clear in his letter to Erasmus. I'm afraid this does not\nchange my situation. \n\n\n\n\n(deletions)\n\n\n\nNo, it is not, although it does look like one. This is a true dichotomy,\neither something exists, or nothing exists. If nothing exists, nobody\nwould ask why. If something exists, it is possible to ask why, but\nactually no existing being could give an answer. \n\nImagine, for a moment, that the nobodies in non-existence could also\nask: "Why nothing exists?" This is equivalent to my counter-question,\n"why nothing exists in nothingness". \n\nNow, "why anything exists" is equivalent to "why something exists in\nsomethingness".  _This_ is what I meant with my tautology, my apologies\nfor the poor wording in my previous post.\n\n\nI do indeed think there probably _is_ no reason for being, or existence,\nin general, for reasons I stated above. However, they will still\nleave open the question "why this, and not that", and this is where\ntheistic explanations come in.\n\nScience cannot give reasons for any _particular_ human being's existence.\n\n\nThis is a deep philosophical question - is determinism true, or not?\nAlso, is God deterministic or not? I tend to think this question has\nno meaning in His case. \n\nIf I am for a reason, I've yet failed to see what it would be. \nFrom our perspective, it looks like 'I' exist for truly random\nreasons. I just rolled two dice - why did I get 6 and 1? How can\nI believe there is any better reason for my existence?\n\n\nYes, I am satisfied with this reason, until I find something better.\nMy 15 years of Christianity were of no help in this respect, I have\nto admit, but I am patient.\n\n\n\nNo, it doesn't, but I think an existing God cannot know why He exists,\nfor an answer to this question is not knowable. Of course, this\nshould not be any obstacle to belief in His existence.\n\n\nIt is impossible to know unknowable things. However, the question \n"why do I exist, in particular" is _not_ an invalid question - this\nis not what I said. But from our perspective, it is impossible to\ntell, and I can't just believe in any given explanation instead of\nanother, especially since I found I was deluding myself. \n\n\nI think "pre-existence" is an oxymoron. There is no time 'outside' of\nthis spacetime (except in some other universe), and from that \nperspective, our universe never was. It exists only for those who\nare inside it. \n\n\nNo. The validity of the question has to be discussed separately; I think\nphilosophy is of great help here. What can be known, and what is not\nknowable?\n\n\nThis is a very good question. In trying to answer this, and numerous\nother questions that bothered me, I finally found nothing to base\nmy faith on. \n\nI think it would be honest if we all asked ourselves, "why do I believe"\nor "why I don't believe". \n\nPetri

Didn't Paul write that if the Resurrection is not true, we are the\nbiggest fools of all?  However, whether you believe in Christ or not,\nHis teachings (e.g. love your brotherman as yourself), even if only \nfollowed at a secular level, could do a great deal to alleviate some of \nthe problems we see today in the world.  Even when I was a rabid atheist \nI couldn't deny that.
The existence of repeated earth lives and destiny (karma) does not\nmean that everything that happens is predetermined by past deeds.\nThere is an oriental view of it that tends in that direction, but I\ndid not subscribe to that view.  God may choose one individual over\nanother as the fit instrument for his plans, but that does not\npreclude that the development of that individual into what he is in\nthis earthly life is not the result of a longer course of development.\n\nI do not, and Rudolf Steiner did not, subscribe to the oriental view\nof an inexorable, mechanistic karma determining everything that\nbefalls one.  This is a kind of shriveled caricature of a much greater\nlaw in the context of which the deed of Christ on Golgotha and the\nultimate salvation and freedom of the human being as a working of\nChrist can be seen as the master theme and, indeed, a new impulse that\nwas completely free of karma.  Christ incarnated only once in the\nflesh, and in that he had no debt of karma or sin.  The oriental\nconcepts of reincarnation and karma, which are even more trivialized\nand mechanized in some new age teachings, incorrectly assume Jesus\nChrist to have been the reincarnation of a master.  avatar, etc.\nTheir teaching of reincarnation and karma also has no concept the\ncontinuing individuality from one life to the next (e.g. Buddhism).\nMore important, they have no concept of the resurrection of the body,\nthe ultimate continuity of the whole human being -- to ultimate\nresurrection and judgement on the Last Day.\n\nThere is another biblical passage that also has a bearing. It is the\ntenth chapter of John, devoted almost entirely to the man born blind.\nClearly here, Jesus tells the disciples that it was not his past karma\nor that of his parents that led to his blindness, but rather that a\nnew impulse is to be revealed through him.  But note that he does not\nrefute the disciples' question.  In fact, they ask it as a matter of\ncourse, the question being stated as if it were self evident that only\none of two possibilities existed - it was either the sins of the man\nhimself, obviously not in this incarnation, or the sins of his\nparents.  The fact that they even asked about the first possibility at\nall indicates an awareness of the idea on their part and the form of\nChrist's answer indicates that he did not disagree with it.\n\nThere is also Matthew 11:14, where Jesus says straight out about John\nthe Baptist,\n\n   "If you care to accept it, he himself is Elias, who was to come."\n\nThis also emphasizes that the Gospels do not have a positive teaching\neither way about reincarnation -- or, in fact, about what happens to\nthe human being at all between death and the Last Day.  Even Jesus did\nnot push this teaching on people who were not ready to embrace it ("If\nyou care to accept it").  So I took care to point out, not that the\nBible teaches reincarnation but that it does not deny it either, and\nthat much in both scripture and fundamental Christian doctrine becomes\nunderstandable if reincarnation is understood in the right way.  I\npointedly used "repeated earth lives" to distinguish a little from the\noriental doctrines usually associated with the word "reincarnation".\nThe phrase is Rudolf Steiner's (wiederholte Erdenleben).  He noted too\nthat the idea needed to arise as a new insight in the west, completely\nfree from eastern tradition.  It did in the eighteenth and nineteenth\ncenturies, the most important expression of it being Lessing's "The\nEducation of the Human Race".\n\nTo return to your original point, Paul's statement about Jacob and\nEsau does not contradict the idea of repeated earth lives and karma.\nAnd both of these principles receive their fulfillment in the\nincarnation, death, and resurrection, ascension and return of Jesus\nChrist, in my view.
On of the attributes of being sacred in this case is that they\nshould not be spoken of in a "common manner" or "trampled under\nfeet" such as the Lords name is today.  The ceremonies are\nperformed in the temple because the temple has been set aside\nas being as sacred/holy/uncommon place.  We believe that the \nceremonies can only be interpreted correctly when they\nare viewed with the right spirit- which in this case is in the\ntemple.  So from our point of view, when they are brought\nout into the public, they are being trampled under feet,\nbecause of misinterpretations and mocking, and it is therefore\noffensive to us.\n\nPlease do not assume that because of my use of the words\n'we' and 'our' that I'm an official spokesman for the LDS\nchurch.  I am merely stating what I believe is the general\nfeeling among us.  Others feel free to disagree.
I realize I'm entering this discussion rather late, but I do\nhave one question. Wasn't it a Reagan appointee, James Watt, a\npentacostal christian (I think) who was the secretary of the interior\nwho saw no problem with deforestation since we were "living in the\nlast days" and ours would be the last generation to see the redwoods\nanyway?
[insert deletion of unnecessary quote]\n\n\nFirst of all, God does not take any sort of pleasure from punishing\npeople.  He will have mercy on whom he will have mercy and compassion on\nwhom he will have compassion (Ex 33:19).  However, if he enjoyed\npunishing people and sending them to hell, then why would he send Jesus\nto "seek and save that which was lost" (Luke 19:10)?\n\nYou asked for it.\n\n2 Peter 2:4-ff talks about how those who are ungodly are punished.\nMatthew 25:31-46 is also very clear that those who do not righteous in\nGod's eyes will be sent to hell for eternity.\n2 Thessalonians 1:6-10 states that those who cause trouble for the\ndisciples "will be punished with everlasting destruction and shut out\nfrom the presence of the Lord".\n2 Thessalonians 2:9-12 talks about those who refuse to love the truth\nbeing condemned.\nRevelation 21:6-8 talks about the difference between those who overcomes\nand those who do not.  Those who do not, listed in verse 8, will be in\nthe "fiery lake of burning sulfur".\nRevelation 14:9-12 gives the indication that those who follow the beast\n"will be tormented with burning sulfur" and there being "no rest day or\nnight" for them because of it.\nPsalm 9:17:  "The wicked return to the grave, all the nations that\nforget God."\n\nI think those should be sufficient to prove the point.\n\n\nJoe Fisher\n\n[In the following I'm mostly playing "devil's advocate".  I'm not\nadvocating either position.  My concern is that people understand that\nit's possible to see these passages in different ways.  It's possible\nto see eternal destruction as just that -- destruction.  Rev often\nuses the term "second death".  The most obvious understanding of that\nwould seem to be final extinction.  The problem is that the NT speaks\nboth of eternal punishment and of second death.  I.e. it uses terms\nthat can be understood either way.  My concern here is not to convince\nyou of one view or the other, but to help people understand that\nthere's a wide enough variety of images that it's possible to\nunderstand them either way.  As Tom Albrecht commented, the primary\npoint is to do our best to keep people out of the eternal fire,\nwhatever the details.  (To make things more interesting, Luke 20:35\nimplies that the damned don't get resurrected at all.  Presumably\nthey just stay dead. -- yes I'm aware that it's possible to \nunderstand this passage in a non-literal way.)\n\n2 Peter 2:4-ff is talking about angels, and talks about holding them\nin hell until the final judgement.  This isn't eternal punishement.\n\nMatthew 25:31-46 talks about sending the cursed into eternal fire\nprepared for the devil and his angels.  The fact that the fire is\neternal doesn't mean that people will last in its flames forever.\nParticularly interesting is the comment about the fire having been\nprepared for the devil and his angels.  Rev 20 and 21 talk about the\neternal fire as well.  They say that the beast and the false prophet\nwill be tormented forever in it.  When talking about people being\nthrown into it (20:13-14), it is referred to as "the second death".\nThis sounds more like extinction than eternal torment.  Is is possible\nthat the fire has different effects on supernatural entities such as\nthe devil, and humans?\n\n2 Thessalonians 1:6-10 similarly, what is "everlasting destruction"?\nThis is not necessarily eternal torment.  This one can clearly be\nunderstood either way, but I think it's at least possible to think\nthat everlasting is being used to contrast the kind of destruction\nthat can occur in this life with the final destruction that occurs in\neternity.\n\n2 Thessalonians 2:8 again talks about destruction.\nRevelation 21:6-8: see comment above\nRevelation 14:9-12 is probably the best of the quotes.  Even there,\nit doesn't explicitly say that the people suffer forever.  It says\nthat the smoke (and presumably the fire) is eternal, and that \nthere is no respite from it.  But it doesn't say that the people\nare tormented forever.\n\nPsalm 9:17:  I don't see that it says anything relevant to this issue.
Do you count yourself as one who is weak in the faith?\n\n\nIs there any doubt in your mind about what is right and what is missing\nthe mark?\n\n\nAre they clear or do you have doubts?\n\n\nAn important first step; the realization that Paul was human.\n\n\nYes, and he was writing and speaking for an audience that was at best,\nvery weak in the faith; most could not read, most were unfamiliar with\nthe Hebrew Scriptures in even the Septuagint form. Paul adapted the\nmessage of the Bible to a largely uneducated market. Granted, this\nmarket still exists today, but do you count yourself as part of it? To\nbe "weak in the faith" is not missing the mark (hamartia) if you do the\nbest that your education allows. Are you doing the best?\n\n\nLet me make clear that the "Law" is none other than the Pentateuch of\nGenesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy. What did Jesus say\nabout the "Law" in Matt5:14-19? Where did Jesus say that the "Law" only\napplies to Jews and that Gentiles are above the "Law"?\n\n\nWho acknowledged this fact? On what basis? Are we extra-biblical at this\npoint? Why not also acknowledge that the Bhagavad-Gita is the only\nrelevant text for Gentiles, after all we see in the Bible that it was\nMagus from the east who observed the star-signs of Jesus? Why bother\nwith any texts at all? Why not just follow whatever the Church has to\nsay?\n\n\nI don't see how you can say this with a straight face. Are you a\nfollower of Christ, or do you follow someone else? Are you saying that\nthe words of Jesus only apply to Jews?\n\n\nHow Jewish was Paul after he changed his name from Saul?\n\n\nWho says Gentile Christians are not covered by the first five books? Who\nsays that Gentile Christians are above the Ten Commandments?\n\n\nYou're implying that Jesus' words are valid only for Jews. Is this\nreally what you mean to say? You do realize that you are gutting rather\nlarge portions of the Bible? When you read Jesus' words, did you ever\nconsider that maybe, just maybe Jesus is talking to you, no matter what\nyour race or sex? If the Hebrew Scriptures and the Gospel accounts of\nJesus are only directed to Jews, why were they translated into English?\n\n\nAs Paul would call him, one who was weak in the faith.\n\n\nWhich is more important: 1) The recorded word of Jesus or 2) Indications\nthat you can deduce from the Bible? Was Jesus God only of the Jews, or\nGod of all humankind of all race and sex?\n\n\nThis is your understanding of Paul. Compare this to the word of Jesus.\nAre you Christian or Pauline?\n\n\nAgain, this is your understanding of Paul. Did Jesus say that the Law\nwas an "impossible standard?" Did Jesus say that He superceded the Law?\nAre you Christian or Pauline?\n\n\nYou acknowledge that it is *your* reading of Paul. What did Jesus say?\nCan you deny that Matt5:14-19 is quite clear in its meaning? Are you \nChristian or Pauline?\n\n\nWhen did Jesus say that the purpose of the Law was conviction of sin?\n\n\nPlease reread Matt5:14-19. Are you Christian or Pauline?\n\n\nAre you saying that the Ten Commandments are ceremonial details?\n\n\nYou call observance of the Sabbath, the day on which the Lord rested,\nceremonial? Has circumcision been superceded for Christians?\n\n....\n\nAre you Christian or Pauline?\n\n[Both.  There is no doubt in my mind about what is sin and what is\nnot, at least not in this case.  Jesus did not deal explicitly with\nthe question of whether the Law was binding on Gentiles.  That's why I\nhave to cite evidence such as the way Jesus dealt with the Centurion.\n\nAs to general Jewish views on this, I am dependent largely on studies\nof Pauline theology, one by H.J. Schoeps, and one whose author I can't\ncome up with at the moment.  Both authors are Jews.  Also, various\nChristian and non-Christian Jews have discussed the issue here and in\nother newsgroups.\n\nMat 5:19 is clear that the Law is still valid.  It does not say that\nit applies to Gentiles.\n\nAnd yes, I say that the specific requirement for worship on the\nSabbath in the Ten Commandments is a ceremonial detail, when you're\nlooking at the obligations of Gentiles.  Similarly circumcision.\n\nI'm not sure quite what else I can say on this subject.  Again, it's\nunfortunate the Jesus didn't answer the question directly.  However we\ndo know (1) what the 1st Cent. Jewish approach was, (2) how Jesus\ndealt with at least one Gentile, and (3) how Jesus' disciples dealt\nwith the issue when it became more acute (I'm referring to Acts 15\nmore than Paul).  Given that these are all in agreement, I don't see\nthat there's a big problem.
I have personally know quite of few of the Wycliffe Bible Translators.\nAs an organization their fundamental purpose is to translate the scriptures\ninto the native languages which in terms usual means learning it and \ndeveloping a written language (along with teaching the natives to read).\nIt is not associated with the U.S. govt. at all.  Many governments\nwant the help of the translators.  To the best of my knowledge the \nMexican government now encourages them to come.  Their idea is not\ncultural interference but the presentation of the Good News.\n\nTo understand more about what they do, I suggest you read some of the books\n(autobiographical and biographical) about some of the translators.  One\nthat stands out in my mind as an excellent is called "Peace Child."\nThis would give a true picture of what their mission is.\n\nI agree with this statement, but we cannot also accept what others\nsay without looking into the issues.  That would be the same as taking \nSuddan's discussion about the CIA, etc. as being true.  We must look\nat both sides.
First by his fruits.  The messiah comes to build the kingdom of heaven\non the earth.  He also comes to first reveal the root cause of\noriginal sin (fallen nature) and then provide a means to cut the\nconnection to that original sin.  He also wants to create world peace\nbased on Godism.  The messiah's teachings will build on the foundation\nof the Bible but provide profound new insights into the nature of God,\nthe fall of man, the purpose of creation, and God's providence of\nrestoration.  It will also provide a foundation for the unity of all\nthe World's religions.\n\nMany Christians expect Jesus to come on literal clouds, so they may\nmiss him when he returns. Just as the Jewish people missed Jesus 2000\nyears ago.  They are still waiting for his first coming.  The Jewish\npeople of that age expected Elijah to come first.  Jesus said that\nJohn the Baptist was Elijah. But John the Baptist denied that he was\nElijah.  (How did this reflect on Jesus?)  Later in prison John even\nquestioned who Jesus was: "is he the one who is to come or do we look\nfor another". (see book of Matthew)\n\n\nDavid Koresh didn't even come close.  The problem is that people like\nthis make it difficult for people to believe and trust in the real\nMessiah when he does show up.\n\n\nVery good point and perhaps the most important point of all for\nChristians: How to recognize the Second Coming?\n\nThe Messiah should not claim to be God.  What sets a Messiah apart is\nthat he is born without original sin.  He is not born perfect but\nachieves perfection after a period of growth.  Adam and Eve were born\nsinless but they fell, and this tragedy meant that it would take God\nthousands of years to create the kingdom of heaven on the earth as God\noriginally intended.  God's restoration providence is still not\ncomplete.  The messiah is the true Son of God, one with God, God's\nrepresentative on the earth, but not God himself.  There is only one\nGod.\n\n...\n\n\n\nWho else in this world is claiming to be the Messiah.  Maybe he's already here.
Joe;\n\nYour logic excapes me. \n\nIf the Papacy is infallible, and this is a matter of faith, then the \nPope cannot "be wrong!"  If, on the other hand, this is not a matter \nof faith, but a matter of Church law, then we should still obey as the\nPope is the legal head of the church.\n\nIn other words, given the doctrine of infallibility, we have no choice\nbut to obey.\n\nBob\n\n-- \nBob Van Cleef              Peace -0- be      revc@garg.Campbell.CA.US\nThe Land of Garg BBS        unto /|\ you           BBS (408) 378-5108

Well, knowing Greek and Hebrew, I'm probably not as picky about translations\nas I would be if English translations were my only source of information.\nBUT...\n\n(1) Any verse that comes out substantially different in different trans-\nlations is almost certainly unclear in the original. \n\n(2) It is very bad practice to "shop" for a translation that fits your own\ndoctrinal positions.\n\nPersonally, I still like the RSV.  NRSV and NASV are also very good.\n\nI have a strong preference for editions that do _not_ indent the beginning\nof each verse as if verses were paragraphs.  The verse numbering is a\nrelatively modern addition and should not be given undue prominence.
Somewhere, someone told me that Satan was the angel in charge of\nmusic in heaven, and on top of that, he was the most beautiful\nof the angels.  Isn't it funny that these days how MTV has become\nthe "bible" of music and beauty these days.  MTV controls what bands\nare popular, no matter how bad they are.  In fact, it is better to\nbe politically correct - like U2, Madonna - than to have any\nmusical talent.  Then of course, you have this television station\nthat tells us all how to dress.  Think about it, who started the\nretro-fashion craze??  MTV and Madonna.  Gag.\n\nAnyway, just food for thought.  It is really my own wierd theory.\n\nIf Revelation was to come true today, I think MTV would the "ever\nchanging waters" (music and fashion world) that the beast would\narise from, and Madonna will be the whore of Babylon, riding the\nbeast and drinking the blood of the martyrs.\n\nHmmmm....great idea for a book/movie.....
I've just read Carol's response and I just had to get into this.  I've\ngot some verses which are not subject to interpretation because they say\nwhat they say.  They are 2 Peter 1:20-21, 2 Timothy 3:16-17, and\nGalatians 1:11-12.  \n\nAlso, based on the fact that Jesus is the Word incarnate and he judges\npeople if they follow him (see Acts 17:29-31 and John 5:21-27) and that\nthose who reject Jesus' teachings are judged by the very words he spoke\n(see John 12:47-50), then Jesus' words are true and do not need\ninterpretation, nor would it be just of God to judge based on his word\nif it had to be interpreted.
Then by that definition, I would be in a cell church only here at IU,\nnot when the whole group gets together at Indianapolis (>950 every week\nin attendance).
Ann Jackson (ajackson@cs.ubc.ca) wrote on 5 May:\n\n\n\n\nI would like to submit the following which helped me enormously.\nIf it has already been posted, I apologize.\n\nIt seems that during the Middle Ages, it was customary for pastors to \nexplain the Trinity to their parishoners by analogy to water.\nWater is water, but can exist in three forms--liquid, ice and vapor.\nThus it is possible for one essence to exist in three forms.\n\nAnd recently, the pastor of my church drew an analogy, which I\nalso found useful--A woman is often percieved by others in three\nways, depending on their relationship to her--a mother, a wife and\nan employee in a business.\n\nThus, it seems clear to me that the essence of God can subsist in\nthe Father, Son, and Holy Spirit or, depending on one's particular\nneed for Him.
Unfortunatly, this seems to be how Christians are taught to think when\nit comes to their religion. Some take it to the extreme and say that\ntheir religion is the ONLY one and if you don't accept their teachings\nthen you won't be "saved". It takes quite a bit of arrogance to claim\nto know what God thinks/wants. Especially when it's based upon your\ninterpretation of a book. The logic in the above statement is faulty\nin that it assumes two people with differing beliefs can't both be\ncorrect. It's all about perception. No two people are exactly alike.\nNo two people perceive everything in the same way. I believe that\nthere is one truth. Call it God's truth, a universal truth, or call it\nwhat you will. I don't believe God presents this truth. I think it is\njust there and it's up to you to look for and see it, through prayer,\nmeditation, inspir- ation, dreams or whatever. Just because people may\nperceive this truth differently, it doesn't mean one is wrong and the\nother is right. As an example, take the question, "Is the glass half\nempty or half full"? You can have two different answers which are\ncontradictory and yet both are correct. So, for your belief to be\ntrue, does not require everyone else's belief to be wrong.
First, off I'd say that the impact if right before your eyes! 8-) That we are\neven discussing this is a major impact in and of itself. Further, the early\nchurch bears testimony to the impact.\n\n\nOf course they knew where it was. Don't forget that Jesus was seen by both\nthe Jews and the Romans as a troublemaker. Pilate was no fool and didn't \nneed the additional headaches of some fishermen stealing Jesus' body to \nmake it appear He had arisen. Since Jesus was buried in the grave of a \nman well know to the Sanhedrin, to say that they didn't know where He was\nburied begs the question.\n\nNow, you say that you think that the disciples stole the body. But think on\nthis a moment. Would you die to maintain something you KNEW to be a \ndeliberate lie!? If not, then why do you think the disciples would!? Now, I'm\nnot talking about dying for something you firmly believe to be the truth, \nbut unbeknown to you, it is a lie. Many have done this. No, I'm talking about\ndying, by beheading, stoning, crucifixion, etc., for something you know to\nbe a lie! Thus, you position with regards to the disciples stealing the \nbody seems rather lightweight to me.\n\nAs for graverobbers, why risk the severe penalties for grave robbing over \nthe body of Jesus? He wasn't buried with great riches. So, again, this is\nan argument that can be discounted.\n\nThat leaves you back on square one. What happened to the body!?\n\nIHL, Gene\n\n--\n   The opinions expressed are not necessarily those of the University of\n     North Carolina at Chapel Hill, the Campus Office for Information\n        Technology, or the Experimental Bulletin Board Service.\n           internet:  laUNChpad.unc.edu or 152.2.22.80
I'll take a try at this...\n\nFrom the discussions I have been in, and from how *I* have interpreted\nthe bible, I feel that one can pray either way.  BUT remember this,\nbefore Jesus, the people talked to God (no other way) and he talked \nback.  (audible and dreams, etc.)  Today we have the bible to know \nGods will, and we have his son you died for US.  He was given as our\nsavior, and while we still do things according to Gods will, we pray\nTHROUGH his son.  In the bible it says that if we are not known to \nJesus, we are not known to God.  (sorry I do not have the verses\nwith me)  So, if we are to be granted eternal life, we must present\nourselves to Jesus first, who will then present us to God.\n\nLeonard\n\n\n\n--
In soc.religion.christian you write:\n\n\nNote that the above type of prediction does not require a God to be made.\nAn expert in a field can also predict things based on experience.\nBeware of predictions like "The volcano will erupt tomorrow!"  Don't\nfollow the preacher because of such statements that come true.\n\nNote also, that if I'm describing a (hypothetical) death of a friend as\na result of his passion for fast motorcycles, I might say "his mother\npredicted he would die."  Of course, his father may have said "he 'll\nmake good money because of his hobby" and depending upon the final\noutcome of the situation I end up mentioning the one that's\nrelevant.  A reader down the road will get the impression that the\nmother or father had predicted accurately the event, when it was just\na casual statement.\n\nFinally, on prophesies, note that there are many prophesies that can be\nfulfilled my people, often to fool believers.  If I say, "Beware, the\nterminal will unexpectedly be shut off!" and then after 2 secs I turn\nit off (or have someone come out from another room and do it) there was\nno prediction.  A similar situation arises with the establishment of\nthe Jewish state.  While pressing for it, prominent Jews argued that it\nwas predicted that they'd have a state again, and that the time has\ncome.  (I've read this somewhere, but can't think of the source - if\nyou can, please let me know.)  In this case, the establishment of the\nstate does not really fulfill the  prophesy since the prophesy was used\nin order to push for the establishment of the state.\n\nDeciding what was truely a fulfillment of prophesy is very tricky.\n\n-leo
> [A very nice article on the DSS, which I thought answered\n   >  David Cruz-Uribe's original queries quite well]\n\n   Here are some books I have read recently that helped me not only\n   prepare for a 5 week series I taught in Sunday School, but greatly\n   increased my knowledge of the Qumran scrolls. [...]\n\nOne other recent book I would heartily recommend is Joseph Fitzmyer's\n_Response to 101 Questions about the Dead Sea Scrolls_ (Paulist,\n1992).\n\nFitzmyer is one of the preeminent modern NT scholars.  He was also one\nof the early workers on the DSS.  His book is written in a\nstraightforward Q&A that allows it to serve as a source for a great\nwealth of clearly presented basic, up-to-the-moment information about\nthe DSS.\n\n(This book is something of a companion volume to Raymond Brown's\n_Response to 101 Questions about the Dead Sea Scrolls_.)\n\nNichael
According to what I have read on Biblical idioms, speaking "in X's\nname" is a standard Aramaic/Hebrew legal idiom for what we today\nwould call Power of Attorney.  A person from Jesus' culture authorized\nto conduct business "in John's name" had full authority over John's\nfinancial affairs, but was held under a solemn fiduciary obligation to\nwork only for John's benefit and consonant with John's wishes.  It was\nnot required for the steward to preface each business transaction with\n"in John's name"; it was sufficient to have valid power of attorney\nand be operating in good faith. (Note the overlap here between legal\nand religious definitions of "faith".)\n\nWith this cultural background, praying "in Jesus' name" does not\nmandate a particular verbal formula; rather it requires that the\npetitioner be operating faithfully and consciously within an analogous\n"fiduciary" relationship with Jesus and for the purposes of His\nKingdom.  The message of "praying in Jesus' name" is thus closely\naligned with the parable of the talents and other passages about God's\ndelegation of Kingdom business to his stewards, both resources and\nresponsibilities.  This idea of praying "in Jesus' name" is not only\npresent but prominent in the Lord's Prayer, although the verbal\nforumula is absent.\n\nThe act of praying the words "In Jesus' Name" may be beneficial if\nthey cause us to clarify the relationship of our requests to the\nadvancement of God's Kingdom.  For that reason, I'm not quite ready\nto say that the praying the formula is without meaning.\n\nPrayers to God for other purposes (desperation, anger, thanksgiving,\netc.) don't seem to be in this category at all, whether uttered by\nChristian or non-Christian, whether B.C. or A.D. (that's B.C.E. or\nC.E. for you P.C. :-).  I don't see anything in Christ's words to\ncontradict the idea that God deals with all prayers according to His\nomniscience and grace.\n\nVan Kelly\nvek@research.att.com

But at the time of the\nRenaissance and Ref ormation in Western Europe man became the centre,\nor the focus of culture (hence "humanism"). This consciousness was\nalso secular, in the sense that it was concerned primarily with the\npresent age, r ather than the age to come. Capitalism arose at the\nsame time, and the power of economics became central in philosophy.\nThis doesn't mean that economics did not exist before, simply that it\nbegan to dominate the conscious cultural values of Western European\nsociety and its offshoots. This cultural shift was, in its later\nstages, accompanied by industrial revolutions and the values that\njustified\n them.\n\nThere was a fundamental cultural shift in the meaning of "economics" -\nfrom the Christian view of man as the economos, the steward, of\ncreation to the secular idea of man as the slave of economic forces\nand powers. There were denominational differences among the new\nworshippers of Mammon. For some the name of the deity was "the free\nrein of the market mechanism", while for others it was "the\ndialectical forces of history". But in both the capitalist West and\nthe socialist East the environment was sacrificed on the altar of\nMammon. The situation was mitigated in the West because thos e who\nwere concerned about the damage to the environment had more freedom to\noppose what was happening and state their case.\n\nSteve
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nJoe, just 'cause you say they aren't subject to interpretation doesn't\nnecesarily make it so.  That's *your* *interpretation* of these texts.\n\n\n2 Peter 1:20-21\nBut know this first of all, that no prophecy of Scripture is a matter \nof one's own interpretation, for no prophecy was ever made by an act of\nhuman will, but men moved by the Holy Spirit spoke from God.\n\nThe study notes in my Bible offer three possible meanings for verse 20.\nApparantly it's not as clear to Charles Ryrie as it is to you.\n\n2 Timothy 3:16-17\nAll Scripture is inspired by God and profitable for teaching, for\nreproof, for correction, for training in righteousness; that the man of\nGod may be adequate, equipped for every good work.\n\nGalations 1:11-12\nFor I would have you know, brethren, that the gospel which was preached\nby me is not according to man.  For I neither received it from man, \nnor was I taught it, but I receieved it through a revelation of Jesus\nChrist.\n\nWhen I read these passages, it was not immediately clear to me what\nevery phrase meant.  I had stop and think about the possible\nconnotations of words, what the intent of the author may have been,\nwonder if the translator used the correct English word to convey the \nsame meaning: I had to interpret.  If you want to believe that your \nare not interpreting Scripture as you read, there's probably nothing \nI can say to change your mind.  But I think it's naive to think that \nour culture, experiences, education, do not affect everything we read.\n\n\nIn college, I took an entire course in Biblical interpretation.  Go to\nany Christian bookstore, there are scores of books on interpreting and\nunderstanding Scripture.  If interpretation is unnecessary, there are \nan awful lot of misguided Christians out there wasting a lot of time \nand energy on it.
Please, leave heaven out of it.  For his own sake, I pray that Dan does\ntake it literally because that's how God intended it to be taken.  Dan,\nyour view of many groups appears correct from my point of view.\nHowever, I have found a group which is truly meeting requirements laid\ndown by the Bible on what it means to be a disciple of Jesus.  I have no\nclue where wwc is, but please mail me.  I'd really like to get you in\ntouch with them.\n\n[insert deletion of ranting about other religions which obviously has\ngone off-center of Dan's original context]\n\nDan, I'm familiar with this one.  You've got a point, though.  There are\nsome who don't want to turn over everything and be a disciple, some have\nno clue about it because they've not been taught, some have done exactly\nthat and turned over everything to follow Jesus, some are blocked by\ndifficult doctrine taught by uncaring Pharisees and teachers of the law.\nHowever, Jesus pointed out what it takes to follow him and to be his\ndisciple in Luke 9:23-26 and Luke 14:25-33.  My question is:  why do\npeople ignore the command and treat it as optional?  I certainly don't\nhave an answer to this.\n\n[insert deletion]\n\n\nMy parents had nothing to do with it.  God had and has everything to do\nwith it.  As for these attacking responses, I must say that I disagree\nwith your tone and what appears to be some very judgmental statements\n(possibly to the point of slander) when talking about people, not what\nthey do.  Please, if you have a response, state it instead of flying off\nthe handle on some discourse which may have nothing truly to do with\nwhat is being discussed.  I'm sure both Dan and I would have a much\nhappier time with your responses.
I don't claim to be an expert on the branch Davidians, but I might know more \nthan most.\n\nThe Branch Davidian group (led by Koresh) is actually one of two off-shoots \nof a group known as the Shephard's Rod.  The Shephard's Rod (now \ndefunct as far as I know)broke off from the SDA Church in the 30's.\n\nThe Shephard's Rod broke away from the SDA Church because they felt that the \nSDA Church was becoming weak and falling into apostacy.  They felt that they \nwere the remnant spoken about in Revelation.\n\nAbout the Koresh group, Koresh gained control of it in 1987 or 1988.  Once \nin control, he made himself the center of it. He proclaimed himself as \nChrist.\n\nKoresh himself came from an SDA background. He was excommunicated as a young \nadult by the local congregation for trying to exert too much control over \nthe youth in the church.  After this, he joined the Branch Davidians.\n\nThey were/are a survivalist cult. This is why they had the stockpile of \nweapons, food, a bomb shelter, etc.  They had no intent of raiding the US \ngovernment or anything. They were preparing for Armaggedon and were \nputting themselves in a self defense position.  \n\nIn my opinion, if the ATF and the FBI had left well enough alone, we wouldn'\nt have the blood of 20+ children crying out from the ashes in Waco.\n\nIf you want to know about The Shephard's Rod, you might want to visit the \nlocal SDA church and talk to some of the older people.  They could give you \nsome insight into where Koresh got his theology.
First of all, "ceremonial law" is an extraScriptural term.  It is sometimes\nused as a framework to view Scripture.  But if you look at Collosions,\nwithout going into it with the assumption that the Sabbath cannot be \na ceremonial law, you will see that it does refer to the sabbath.\n\nagainst us to His cross, and therefore we should not be judged in what\nwhat food we eat, what we drink, the keeping of new moons and holy days,\nor the keeping of the sabbath.\n\nThe word for sabbath in this verse is "sabbaton" and is used throughout the\nNew Testament to refer to the 7th day.  If there is any Scripture from\nwhich we get the idea of the ceremonial law, this is one of them, and the\nsabbath is listed among the ceremonial laws.\n\nIf one goes into this with the fundamental assumption "the sabbath cannot\nbe a ceremonial law" then he will have to find some way around it, like\nsaying that this can only refer to the other sabbath holy days besides the\n7tH day, Because "the sabbath cannot be a ceremonial law."  But\nPaul is very careful in his letters to add some kind of parenthetcal \nstatement if there is anything that can be seen as a liscence to sin\nin his writings.\n\nAlso, why is the sabbath absent from the epistles (except for Hebrews 4, which\ntalks about the rest that comes through faith?)  Surely it would have\nbeen a big problem for first century Christians living in a society\nthat did not rest on the 7th day.  Especially slaves. Many new converst were\nslaves.  It would have been difficult for slaves to rest on the sabbath\nif it had been mandatory.  Why is there no mention of this in the epistles?
I must have missed the postings about Waco, David Koresh, and the Second\nComing.  How does one tell if a Second Coming is the real thing, unless the\nperson claiming to be IT is obviously insane?\n\nI'm not saying that David Koresh is the Second Coming of Christ.  How could\nsomebody who breaks his word be the Second Coming?  Koresh did promise that\nhe would come out of his compound if only he was allowed to give a radio\nbroadcast.  He didn't.  Still it seems to me that he did fool some people.\n\nAnd, from my meagre knowledge of the Bible, it seems that Christians have\nbeen hard on the Jews of Christ's day for being cautious about accepting\nsomebody that their religious authorities didn't accept as the Messiah.\n\nSo I was surprised that nobody had discussed the difficulty of wanting to be\nearly to recognize the Second Coming while, at the same time, not wanting to\nbe credulously believing just anybody who claims to be God.\n\n[Mark 13:21   And then if any one says to you, 'Look, here is the Christ!' \nor 'Look, there he is!' do not believe it. \nMark 13:22   False Christs and false prophets will arise and show signs and \nwonders, to lead astray, if possible, the elect. \nMark 13:23   But take heed; I have told you all things beforehand. \nMark 13:24    "But in those days, after that tribulation, the sun will be \ndarkened, and the moon will not give its light, \nMark 13:25   and the stars will be falling from heaven, and the powers in \nthe heavens will be shaken. \nMark 13:26   And then they will see the Son of man coming in clouds with \ngreat power and glory. \n\nMy understanding of Jesus' answer is that, unlike his first coming,\nwhich was veiled, the second coming will be quite unmistakeable.  He's\ntelling us not to be misled by the other things that have to happen\nbefore his second coming -- the actual second coming will make his\npower openly visible.\n\nBy the way, from Koresh's public statement it's not so clear to me\nthat he is claiming to be Christ.
If possible (last I heard, it was out of print but they were considering \nreprinting) read Barbara Hambly's _Search the Seven Hills_.  It is \nhistorical fiction, set in Rome at the time of the early Church.  She \ncaptures the weirdness of the early Christians and yet gives glimpses of \nthe holiness too.  Some of their odd views make a lot more sense in the \ncontext of the society they lived in.  I found it a remarkably positive \nview of Christianity considering that the author is not a Christian \nherself.  Another plus is that each chapter begins with an \noriginal-source quote so that it makes a good starting point for serious \nresearch.
How about:\n\n	The Holocaust\n	The Spanish Inquisition\n	Jonestown\n\n(just to name a few) ?\n\nAuthorities sometimes tell people to do evil things.  People who "just\nfollow orders" have tortured and killed others in very large numbers,\nand protest their innocence afterwards.\n\nWhen your authority starts telling you to do things, you should ask\nquestions.  Except for situations of pressing need ("I said shut the\nhatch because the submarine is filling with water!"), any reasonable\nauthority should be able to give at least some justification that you\ncan understand.\n\nJust be sure to listen when authority answers.\n\n(If anybody is interested in questions of psychological pressure and\n following orders, you might want to read about a study done by Solomon Ashe\n in 1951 on conformity, and another done by Stanley Milgram in 1963 on\n obedience.  Both should be in any good book on psychology/sociology.  The\n results are both fascinating and terrifying.)
In the discussion as to why Jesus spoke aloud the "Lazarus, come out",\nI'm surprised that no one has noticed the verse immediately preceeding.\n\nJn 12:41  "Father, I thank you for listening to me, though I knew that\nyou always listen to me.  But I have said this for the sake of the\npeople that are standing around me that they may believe that you have\nmade my your messenger."  (Goodspeed translation)\n\nMy guess is that the "Lazarus, come out!" was also for the sake of the\ncrowd.
Actually, there was very little to the book.  First of all looking at\nthe titles of her other books, I would personally consider her \nto be engaged in a bizarre form of Christian-like mysticism\nheavily influenced by eastern philosphies (great titles like \n_The_Astrology_of_the_4_Horsemen_).\n\nHowever, other than the Chapter One into, there's nothing original,\nbiased, or even new this book.  It is basically a collection of previously\npublished works by those who claim that there exist Buddhist and Hindu\nstories that Christ visited India and China (he was known as Issa) \nduring the period from late teens to age 30.\n\nConclusion:  the book actually lets you come to your own view by presenting\na summary of various published works and letters, all of which you\ncould verify independently.  It includes refutations to such works as\nwell.  Therefore, even if you think she is theologically warped, this \nbook is a nice reference summary for the interested.
: I would like to get your opinions on this: when exactly does an engaged\n: couple become "married" in God's eyes?  Some say that if the two have\n: publically announced their plans to marry, have made their vows to God, and\n: are unswervingly committed to one another (I realize this is a subjective\n: qualifier) they are married/joined in God's sight.\n\nThe way I read Scripture, a couple becomes married when they are *physically*\nmarried, i.e. when they first have sexual intercourse.\n\ne.g. the end of Genesis 2 (quoted from memory) ``for this reason, a man shall\nleave his parents and be joined to his wife, and they will become one flesh''\n(Jesus also quotes this scripture referring to marriage).\n\nIf you read through Genesis in particular, you will often come across the\nphraseology: ``[man] lay with [woman], and she became his wife''. This\nimplies that she became his wife when they lay together, i.e. at the\npoint of intercourse.\n\nCompare this with Jewish tradition: Joseph, when he heard that Mary\nwas pregnant, had it in mind to divorce her quietly -- but Mary and Joseph were\n*betrothed*, not married. i.e., they were in a binding relationship (which\nrequired a divorce to get out of), but *marriage* would not occur until Mary\nand Joseph went to bed together.\n\nCompare with Christ and the Church (Ephesians 5, Revelation 19): the church is\ndescribed as the ``bride'' of Christ, but the *marriage* of the Lamb takes \nplace when Jesus returns. i.e., we are in a binding love-relationship with\nJesus, but we are still looking forward to the time when the marriage will\ntake place. I see this as the spiritual equivalent of sexual intercourse,\nbecause it represents the most intimate fellowship possible between man and God.\n\nIn summary, engagement should be honoured as a binding relationship, but it is\nnot marriage. A civil ceremony is not marriage either. Marriage occurs at the\npoint when the betrothed couple go to bed together. (I don't mean to demean the\ncivil or church ceremony -- ours was great! I don't mean to be too pedantic.)\nHistorically, I think I am correct in stating that the civil ceremony (i.e. a\nmarriage recognised by the state), has only been around in the West since\nNapoleon, who introduced it to keep tabs on the people (although I'm ready to be\ncorrected on that point!)\n\nThis view obviously raises some questions:\n\nWhat about those who have had sex with one or more partners, without considering\nmarriage. Are those people also ``married''?\n\nIf it is true that marriage occurs at the point of intercourse, is it necessary\nto be married in the eyes of the state? (I would say Yes, because this honours\nthe laws of our nations in the West. Although it is not illegal to sleep\ntogether though unmarried in most Western countries, I believe that it is God-\nhonouring to proclaim our marriage to the state and to our friends before\nactually consummating our marriage. Its to do with our being salt and light, and\nalso to do with how people will perceive us; i.e. it is culturally insensitive\nto declare yourself married without going through a civil ceremony.)\n\n-- \n\n-----\nMichael Davis (cs89mcd@brunel.ac.uk)

The Bible does tell us that governments are ordained by God (Romans 13).\n And furthermore, God foreknows everything that would happen.  It is\njust to difficult for humans to graps with our limited minds, the\ninevitablity of the sucess of God's plan, and this is especially hard to\ngrasp when we see governemnts doing evil.  However, though they are\ndoing evil (and we should not cooperate with them when they do such), it\nmust be understood that what happens is what God wanted so as to lead to\nthe final sucess of His plan to save as many souls from hell as is\npossible.  In short, the slaughter in Bosnia, though deplorable in the\neyes of God (maybe, then again, they might be getting their just deserts\nnow rather than later; there are plenty of examples of God killing\npeople for their sins - Onan in the Old Testmament for example, and\nAnnias and Spahira in the New) is what he willed to happen so that His\nplan might be accomplished.\n    But don't forget, it is not unbiblical for God to use one nation to\nexecute His just judgement upon another.  The Romans were used to\nfulfill the chorus of "Let his blood be upon our hands" of the crowd in\nJersualem.  And Chaldea was chastised by Babylon, which got Israel,\nwhich was inturn gotten by Persia, etc.  God does use nations to punish\nother nations, as the Bible very clearly shows in the Old Testament. \nDon't you remember the words of God recorded in Daniel, "Mene, mene,\ntekel, peres?"  Babylon had been weighed in the balance scales of God's\njustice, found severly wanting, and was thus given over to the Persians\nas their due punishment for their rebellion.  Another exammple is the\nextirmination of the Cannanites, ordered by God as the task of Israel. \nThe Cannanites had been given their chance, found severly wanting, and\nthe Great Judge, carried out His just sentence accrodingly.  I could go\non with more examples, but I see little need to do so, as my point is\nquite clear.\nTwo things need to be remembered at all times. 1) It is not up to us to\nquestion why God has ordered the world as He has.  In His divine Wisdom,\nHe made the world as was best in His eyes, and like Paul says in Romans\n9, the clay is not one to tlak back to the potter.  2) The message of\nJesus Christ is as follows: "Repent now, for the Kingdom of Heaven is at\nhand."  Jesus Christ did not allow any time for dilly-dallying - "Let\nthe dead bury the dead, come, follow me."  There is not an infinite\namount of time, rather Christ is passing by right now, calling people to\nfollow Him and become fishers of men.  He does not say, "well, alright,\nyou can call me back in a week and see if my Kingdom fits in with your\nplans."  He said "Follow me."  His message is NOT "I'm just a sweety-pie\nwho would never hurt a fly, you've got all the time in the world, and\nDivine Judgement, that's only a fairy tale."  "Our great God and Savior"\nJesus Christ (Titus 2.5) is also the just and righteous Judge of the\nworld.  And it is not up to the defendants in the trial to be\nquestioning his entirely just sentences of either chastisement or mercy.
Is it appropriate for the Lord not to reveal certain \nthings before the world (i.e., publish them widely)?\n\nThese things sacred to Himself.  He may place any \npre- or post-conditions He feels are necessary.\n\nMoreover, there are precedents in scripture where\nknowledge of sacred things is withheld:\n\n1. After the Transfiguration Jesus instructed\nPeter, James, and John to "tell the vision to no \nman, until the Son of man be risen again from \nthe dead" (Matt. 17:9).  \nIf we were living at the time of Savior, there\nwould be no (public) record of this event.\n\n2. A faithful friend of Paul experiences a vision \nof "paradise" when he "heard unspeakable words, \nwhich it is not lawful for a man to utter"\n(2 Cor. 12:4).\nThis person heard something which Paul can not \nwrite to the Corinthians (and us).\n\n3. There is an incident recorded in the Book of\nMormon where words uttered by "babes" were \n"forbidden that there should not any man write\nthem (3 Nephi 26:16, the entire text follows\nfor those of you without access to the BOM).\n\n3 Nephi 26:16\nBehold, it came to pass on the morrow that the \nmultitude gathered themselves together, and they\nboth saw and heard these children; yea, even \nbabes did open their mouths and utter marvelous\nthings; and the things which they did utter were\nforbidden that there should not any man write them.\n\nSome LDS scholars speculate that these words\nwhich could not be written are the sacred\nportions from temple we are to withhold from \nthe world (but it could be something else).\n\n\nThere is much we can discuss about the temple \nordinances.  We can discuss regarding baptisms\nand other vicarious ordinances for the dead.\nWe can discuss certain concepts regarding the\nendowment ("the ritual").\nHowever, there are certain elements I can not\ndiscuss with anyone (including other saints)\noutside of the temple.\nAs a portion of the endowment, we receive the\ntokens and signs that will permit us access\nto Heaven.  I must keep this knowledge sacred \nand respect the conditions under which it is\nrevealed to me.
Darren> In an earlier article, I explained that what many people find\nDarren> arrogant about Christians is that some Christians profess\nDarren> absolute certainty about their beliefs and doctrines.\n\nand\n\nDarren> In short, the problem is that no matter how good your sources\nDarren> are, if any part of your doctrines or beliefs rest on your own\nDarren> thinking and reasoning, then those doctrines are suspect.\n\nThe point that Darren raises is a very Lutheran viewpoint.  \nWhile reason is a gift from God, it is also infected by sin.\nYet we do not reject reason entirely--and neither, I think, \ndoes Darren.  We need reason, as Darren himself has pointed\nout, to comprehend God's revelation of himself in the Bible.\nBut reason alone is not sufficient to comprehend and believe\nthe Word.  We need, first and foremost, faith.  For "the sinful\nmind is hostile to God.  It does not submit to God's law,\n*nor can it do so*"  (Romans 8:7).\n\nLuther accepted Scripture as the sole means of revelation\n("Sola Scriptura"), but accepted the necessity of the use\nof reason (with faith) in comprehending that revelation.\nYet Luther also said, regarding baptism, "But mad reason\nrushes forth, and, because Baptism is not dazzling like\nthe works which we do, regards it as worthless." (Large\nCatechism, Fourth part, Baptism).  To make matters more\ncomplicated, Luther was the sort of theologian that many \npeople would describe as an `absolutist'.  I've seen him \ndescribed as a `take no prisoners' theologian.\n\nWe might conclude, given these observations, that Luther\nwas inconsistent or mad.  And surely at least some have\ncome to that conclusion.  But it might be useful to\nrecall that Jesus was also called mad.  And Peter felt\ncompelled to defend himself and the apostles against\na charge of drunkenness on Pentecost.  So we as Christians\nought to be careful about rejecting Luther (or others) \nas mad.  Rather, we should imitate the Bereans, who\nexamined the Scriptures every day to see if what Paul\nsaid was true (Acts 17:11).\n\nThe basis for the confidence with which Luther, Peter, Paul, and many\nothers preached the gospel was not just reason, but faith and the Holy\nSpirit.  This is not faith divorced from reason, but a faith that\nguides, informs, and uses reason.  The Spirit enables us to know the\ntruth and to proclaim it boldly.  God does not want us to preach the\nmessage that "I think that Jesus might have risen from the dead" but\nrather "I know that my redeemer lives!"  (Job 19:25).  The Christian\ndoes not side with Pilate in saying "What is truth?" but rather\nfollows Christ, who said, "In fact, for this reason I was born, and\nfor this I came into the world, to testify to the truth.  Everyone on\nthe side of truth listens to me" (John 18:37).\n\nWe can know the truth because God has promised us that we can\nknow the truth.  Jesus said, "If you hold to my teachings,\nyou are really my disciples.  Then you will know the truth,\nand the truth will set you free" (John 8:31,32).  The Proverbs\nurge us "Buy the truth, and do not sell it." (Pr 23:23).\nThe Psalmist prayed "Do not snatch to word of truth from my mouth"\n(Ps 119:43).  Evidently he believed that the word of truth\nwas in fact `in his mouth'.  \n\nYet we do indeed appear arrogant if our claim to the truth\nis motivated by self-glorification.  But if we present the\ntruth as the teachings of Scripture, revealed by the \nSpirit, and not our own invention, and if we stand ready\nto be proved wrong on the basis of Scripture, as Luther\ndid, then we are not arrogant, but humble.  We should humbly\ntrust in God's promise of truth, just as we trust in his\npromise of forgiveness.\n\nREXLEX> It is only because of God's own revelation that we can be \nREXLEX> absolute about a thing.\n\nDarren> But how far does that get you?  Once God's revelation stops,\nDarren> and your own reasoning begins, possibility for error appears.\n\nI agree that we must make a distinction between the clear teachings\nof Scripture, and the products of our own reason--even when such\nreasoning is based on Scripture.  However I think I would draw\nthe line of distinction more `reasonably'  :-)  and less `academically'\nthan you would.\n\nDarren> For example, let's suppose that our modern Bible translations\nDarren> include a perfect rendering of Jesus words at the Last Supper,\nDarren> and that Jesus said, exactly, "This is my body."\n\nDarren> We'll presume that what he said was totally without error and\nDarren> absolutely true.  What can we be certain of?  Not much.\n\nDarren> At the moment he stops speaking, and people start\nDarren> interpreting, the possibility of error appears.  Did he mean\nDarren> that literally or not?  We do not have any record that he\nDarren> elaborated on the words.  Was he thinking of Tran- or Con-\nDarren> substantiation?  He didn't say. \n\nDarren is almost at the point of making a very Lutheran statement\nabout the Lord's supper.  The Lutheran approach is to say\nthat if Jesus said, "This is my body," then that is what we\nshould believe.  Other interpretations are rejected simply because\nthey are not taught in Scripture.\n\nRecall that Jesus' words do not stand alone on this subject.  We also\nhave Paul's words in 1 Corinthians 11:17-34,--in which he passed on to\nus, what he received from the Lord.  In particular he said, "For\nwhenever you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the\nLord's death until he comes."  By these words we should believe that\nthe bread that we eat in the Lord's Supper really is bread (as well as\nthe Lord's body)--as our senses in fact tell us.  Does this *prove*\nthat tran-substantiation is false?  I suppose someone could say that\nPaul spoke metaphorically of the Lord's body as bread, simply because\nthat is the way the body appears when we eat it.  But this thought is\nfound nowhere in Scripture.  So we reject it.  Thus the primary\nreason for rejecting tran-substantiation is not that we can\nprove it false, but that it is simply not found in Scripture.\n\n[side remark]\nI've been told that the Lutheran doctrine on real presence is\ncon-substantiation.  But it has been non-Lutherans who have told\nme this.  We tend not to use the word.  I almost think that this\nis used more by professors of comparative religion, who need labels\nto compare Catholic, Lutheran and Reformed teachings on the Lord's\nSupper.  But almost every church wants to call their own teaching\n"real presence" because that was the traditional teaching of \nthe church.\n[end side remark]\n\nDarren> When Christians speak as if they believe their own reasoning\nDarren> can never lead them astray -- when we implicitly claim that we\nDarren> are infallible -- the non- Christians around us rarely believe\nDarren> that implicit claim.  Witnessing is hardly going to work when\nDarren> the person you are talking to believes that you are either too\nDarren> foolish to recognise your own limits, or intentionally trying\nDarren> to cover them up.\n\nThis is precisely why Christians should not rely on rationalizations\nin their witnessing.  It is far better to take the approach,\n"I'd like to show you what Scripture says.  You decide for \nyourself whether to believe it or not."\n\nDarren> `REXLEX' suggested that people read _He is There and He is Not\nDarren> Silent_, by Francis Schaeffer.  I didn't think very highly of\nDarren> it, but I think that Mr Schaeffer is grossly overrated by many\nDarren> Evangelical Christians.  Somebody else might like it, though,\nDarren> so don't let my opinion stop you from reading it.\n\nDarren> If someone is interested in my opinion, I'd suggest _On\nDarren> Certainty_, by Ludwig Wittgenstein.\n\nAs long as we're trading references, I'd like to suggest Dr. Siegbert\nBecker's paperback, "The Foolishness of God: The place of reason\nin Lutheran theology," published by Northwestern Publishing House.\nThis book was based on Becker's doctoral thesis at the University\nof Chicago.
The book is called "27 basic fundamental beliefs" or something very close to \nthat.  the number *IS* 27, not 30.  I have a copy at home (i'm away at \nschool.)
The only info I have is my area is not having a large march.  They are leaving\nit up to each congragation.  IMO this means organizers found it too difficult\nto manage or no one feels the need to be involved.\n\nI'm not casting stones, my involvement with the Lord does not include the March\nthis year.  Maybe He is giving a message by the lack of one??  JLS
One interpretation I've heard of this verse is that it refers to the sin \nof physically abusing one's wife.  The husband is usually physically \nstronger than his wife but is not permitted to use this to dominate her.  \nHe must honor her as his sister in Christ.  This would therefore be an \nexample of a specific sin that blocks prayer.\n\nThis verse also makes me think of the kind of husband who decides what \nis God's will for his family without consulting his wife.  God reveals \nHis will to both the husband and the wife.  There needs to be some \ndegree of mutuality in decision making.  Even those whose understanding \nof the Bible leads to a belief in an authoritarian headship of the \nhusband need to incorporate this in order to have a functional family.  \nOne way to look at it is that God speaks to the wife through the husband \nand to the husband through the wife.
This subject seems to be incredibly inflammatory.  Those who subscribe to\n_Biblical Archaeology Review_ will remember a spectacular letter battle set off when someone\ncomplained about a Franklin Mint ad.  (_BAR_ is a great magazine, but the\ncontrast between the rather scholarly articles and the incredibly sleazy ads\nis extreme.)  In this ad, they were hawking a doll with a head based on the\nfamous bust of Nefertiti, giving the face a typical doll-pink complexion.\nThe letter complained about this as a misrepresentation on the grounds that\nNefertiti was "a beautiful black queen."  This set off an exchange of\nhotheaded letters than ran for several issues, to the point where they had\nan article from an Egyptologist titled "Was Cleopatra Black?"  (The answer\nto the title is "no"-- she was greek.)\n\nI have to say that I hear a hysterical note in much of the complaining.  I\npersonally have seen only one blond-haired Jesus (in the National Shrine in\nWash. DC), and I found it very jarring.  Western representations vary\nenourmously, but in general the image of is of a youngish male with dark\nhair and beard, of a sort that can be found (modulo the nose) all up and\ndown the Mediterranean.\n\n(Also, if what I remember is correct, the "Black Madonna" doesn't represent\na person with negroid features.  It is black because of an accident.  Joe\nBuehler....?)\n\nIn the presence of all those marble statues, one is prone to forget that\ngreeks are rather likely to have black hair.  When one crosses the bosporus,\nthe situation breaks down completely.  Are Turks white?  How about Persians,\nor various groups in the indian subcontinent?  Was Gandhi white?  How about\nthe Arabs?  Or picture Nassar and Sadat standing side by side.  And then\nthere are the Ethiopians....\n\nThose of a white racist bent are not likely to say that *any* of these\npeople are "white" (i.e., of the racist's "race").  If I may risk a\npotentially inflammatory remark, one undercurrent of this seems to be the\nidentification of modern jews as members of the oppressor race.  Considering\nthe extreme dicotomy between medieval religion on the one hand and medieval\nantisemitism on the other, I don't think that this "Jesus was white" thesis\never played the roles that some hold it did.\n\nRepresentations of Jesus as black or korean or whatever are fine.  It seems\nawfully self-serving to insist that Jesus belongs to one's own racial group.
<< < For example: why does the universe exist at all?  \n\n<Whether there is a "why" or not we have to find it. This is Pascal's(?) wager.\n<If there is no why and we spend our lives searching, then we have merely\n<wasted our lives, which were meaningless anyway.

Certainly in modern society many people are convinced life is\nhopeless (or so the pollsters and newscasts state), but I don't see\nwhere this is a good reason to become religious. If you want 'meaning'\nwhy not just join a cult, such as in Waco? The leaders will give you\nthe security blanket you desire.
stuff deleted ...\n\n \nYour logic is falty.  If Christianity is a DRUG, and once we die we\ndie, then why would you be reluctant to embrase this drug so that\nwhile you are alive you enjoy yourself.\n\nI also question your overall motives for posting this article.  Why\nwould you waste your presious fews seconds on this earth posting your\nopinon to a group that will generally reject it.\n\nIf you die, never having acepting Christ as your savior, I hope you\nhave a fantastic life that it is all you evver dreamed because it is\nal of heaven you will ever know.
I disagree with your claim that Jews were not evangelistic (except in\nthe narrow sense of the word).  Jewish proselytism was widespread.\nThere are numerous accounts of Jewish proselytism, both in the New\nTestament and in Roman and Greek documents of the day.
<. . ..\n\n: The next Sunday, the sermon was about Joshua 6 (where the Israelites\n: take Jericho and then proceed to massacre everybody there --- except\n: for Rahab, who had sheltered the spies).  With those reports about\n: Bosnia in my mind, I felt uncomfortable about the minister saying that\n: the massacre (the one in Joshua) was right.  But what really bothered\n: me was that, if I was going to try taking Christianity seriously, I\n: shouldn't be so troubled about the reports of "ethnic cleansing" in\n: Bosnia.  Certainly, my sympathies shouldn't be with the Moslims.\n: Considering that the Bosnian Muslims are descendants of Christians\n: who, under Turkish rule, converted to Islam could the Serbs be doing\n: God's work?\n\nPerhaps it would be useful to ask whether those doing the ethnic\ncleansing could be said to be loving those they are killing in the very\nact of killing.  Does it reflect the attitude of God, who sends rain to\nboth the just and the unjust?  If not, then Christians should be\nuncomfortable with it.  Jesus gave his followers the law of love to\nfollow and it is by exhibiting this that disciples will be known. \nDoctrinal (or political) correctness is not the standard, so I don't see\nwhy Christians should be moved against the Serbs because their ancestors\nconverted from Christianity to Islam.  It seems to me that as a\nChristian you _should_ be troubled by the ethnic cleansing.\n--
Heres the life of St. MAria Goretti, posted with kind permission of\nthe editor of the Australian Catholic Magazine "Morning Star".\n\nHope you like it.\n\n    Put up with anything to prevent sin St. Maria Goretti\n\n\n\n    Maria was born on October 16th 1890 to Luigi and Assunta Goretti,\n    the  eldest  daughter  in the family of seven. She was a cheerful\n    girl, always imitating her parents.  She had but one disire,  but\n    one wish: to receive our Lord in the Blessed Sacrament.\n\n    The date was finally set for little Maria to receive our Lord  on\n    the feast of Corpus Christi. For Maria, time seemed like an eter-\n    nity as she  slowly  neared  the  great  day.   When  it  finally\n    arrived, Fr. Jerome( the priest who was to celebrate the Mass and\n    give the children their First Holy Communion) delivered a  sermon\n    on	the  immense love of Jesus Christ for them and the great love\n    we should have in return for Him. He then warmly  urged  them  to\n    die rather than commit a mortal sin.\n\n    Maria humbly approached the Altar of God and  received  the  Holy\n    Eucharist.	Her  only  sadness  was  the  thought of her father's\n    absence, who died some time beforehand. As for the	rest  of  the\n    day,  Maria remained under the spell of the divine visit; that is\n    until\n\n				   -4-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    her thoughts changed to when she could go next to Holy Communion.\n    Thus ended the happiest day of Maria's life.\n\n    Over the next twelve months, Maria had changed  from  a  giggling\n    little girl into a quiet young lady with responsibilities. As her\n    mother went out into the fields in place of  her  husband,	Maria\n    took  on the ironing, cooking, washing and other motherly duties.\n    She was doing this not only for her own family, but also for  the\n    Serenellis, a father and son who lived with the Goretti's, owning\n    a share in the farm. Although Maria was poorer than all the other\n    children, she by far surpassed them in virtue. In all thi ngs she\n    did the Holy Will of God.\n\n    During the month of June,  Alessandro  Serenelli(the  son)	twice\n    made advances upon Maria when he chanced to be alone with her. On\n    both occasions Maria managed to  struggle  free  of  Alessandro's\n    strong  grip, but on the second, he threatened to kill her if she\n    even uttered a word to her mother. From this day on, Maria	lived\n    in terror, fearing lest Alessandro attack again.\n\n\n    On July 5th 1902, Alessandro left work in the fields  to  "get  a\n    handkerchief,"  as	he  claimed. He went to the storeroom beneath\n    the house where Maria, who was outside on the  landing  with  the\n    baby,  could  hear him fumbling about in with tools. She wondered\n    what he was doing. It was later learned that he was sharpening  a\n    91/2"  blade. He went to the house and called for Maria. She told\n    him she wouldn't go to him unless she knew why she was needed. He\n    stormed out to the landing and dragged her up to her room. Mar ia\n    instantly realized what he was up to. "No, No, No! Do  not	touch\n    me!  It  is a sin, you will go to Hell!" At this point Alessandro\n    held the knife over Maria's chest, who was now on the floor.\n\n    "Will you or will you not?" Maria gathered all her energy.	"No I\n    will  not,	Alessandro,  no!"   She had chosen her martyrdom over\n    sin, God over Satan.  Overcome with rage, Alessandro plunged  the\n    knife  into   Maria's  breast fourteen times.  Finally he came to\n    his senses and thought Maria was dead.  Frantically he threw  the\n    knife behind a closet and locked himself in his room.  The crying\n    of the baby Teresa	on  the  landing  brought  the	attention  to\n    Assunta  and the father of Alessandro. As the baby was unattended\n    and was in danger of falling off, they ran to the house  to  find\n    Maria,  who,  covered in blood, was dragging herself to the door.\n    When asked what happened she said Alessandro  stabbed  her.   "He\n    wanted to make me do wrong and I would not."\n\n    The ambulance arrived, then the police who took Alessandro	away.\n    As	the  ambulance	carried  Maria to the hospital, a large crowd\n    followed on foot.  The doctors at the  hospital held no hope  for\n    poor  little Maria.  The same Fr. Jerome who gave Maria her First\n    Communion\n\n				   -5-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    came to administer the last rites and to give her Holy  Viaticum.\n    He asked Maria if she would forgive her murderer.  "Yes.  For the\n    love of Jesus I forgive him.  I wish for him to one day  join  me\n    in	Paradise.   May  God forgive him, for I alread y have." Maria\n    died at about three o'clock.\n\n    Alessandro was tried  and  found  guilty  of  Maria's  death  but\n    because  of  his  age  he  was  sentenced to only thirty years in\n    prison.  After eight  years of being a violent prisoner and show-\n    ing  no regret for his crime, he saw in a dream, in the  midst of\n    a field of flowers, Maria holding out a bunch of white lilies  to\n    him.  Soon later he wrote to the local bishop, begging God's par-\n    don for the grave sin he had committed.  He later gave  testimony\n    in	Maria's  beatification in 1947.  Less than three years later,\n    on Ju ne 24th 1950, Maria was canonised.  Assunta Goretti was the\n    first mother ever to be present at her daughter's canonisation.\n\n    May St. Maria Goretti help	us  to	be  pure  and  grant  us  the\n    strength to die rather than commit a mortal sin.\n\n    Saint Maria Goretti, pray for us.\n\n\n    by Brendan Arthur
Regarding the moral question Jen (jenk@microsoft.com) asked: "Is it\nokay to create a child if you aren't able to be a good parent?", I\nam reminded of a "speech" by one of the characters (I can't remember\nwhich) in the movie "Parenthood". [I am WAY to liberal with my\nquotation marks tonight...]\n\nIn this so-called (by me) speech, the character is expressing what \na lousy father he had and he made an interesting point.  He said\nsomething to the effect of:\n"You have to have a license to drive a car.  You have to have a\nlicense to own a dog.  You even have to have a license to fish.\nBut, they'll anyone have a kid." [Keep in mind that I am, in NO\nway, trying to pass this off as a quote.  It is probably GROSSLY\ndistorted but I think you get the point...]
That's a very weak argument--due the lack (with regard to critical\nevents) of independent supporting texts.\n\nAs for the dating of the oldest extant texts of the NT....  How would\nyou feel about the US Civil War in a couple of thousand years if the\nonly extant text was written about *now*?  Now adjust for a largely\nilliterate population, and one in which every copy of a manuscript is\ndone by hand....\n\n	--Hal
I don't understand who this post is directed towards; who are you\ntrying to convince? By its subject i would assume you are directing\nthe argument towards people who do not believe that Christ rose\nfrom the dead, but in your "proof," you use the bible exclusively.\n\nThe post is therefore immediately useless to anyone who doesn't\nbelieve that the bible is an unadulterated truth, and to everyone\nelse, it is just a reaffirmation of a belief already held. As far\nas i know, there is no disagreement between christians over\nthe resurrection of christ.\n\nso my question is: what is the purpose of this post?\n\ntomas
Some variant is quite popular.  This, and other arguments, are\ndiscussed in John Leslie Mackie's "The Miracle of Theism: arguments\nfor and against the existence of God".  Although Mackie ultimately\nsides with "against", his arguments are, I think, quite fair to both\nsides.  Brief discussions can be found in the alt.atheism FAQs.
Hello,\n\n  I have seen two common threads running through postings by atheists on the \nnewsgroup, and I think that they can be used to explain each other.  \nUnfortunately I don't have direct quotes handy...\n\n1) Atheists believe that when they die, they die forever.\n\n2) A god who would condemn those who fail to believe in him to eternal death\n   is unfair.\n\n  I don't see what the problem is!  To Christians, Hell is, by definition, \neternal death--exactly what atheists are expecting when they die.  There's no\nreason Hell has to be especially awful--to most people, eternal death is bad\nenough.\n  Literal interpreters of the Bible will have a problem with this view, since\nthe Bible talks about the fires of Hell and such.  Personally, I don't think\nthat people in Hell will be thrust into flame any more than I expect to Jesus\nwith a double-edged sword issuing from his mouth--I treat both these statements\nas metaphorical.
Is anyone familiar with Doug Sturm?
First, I would like to thank all who sent me their opinions on the matter\nat hand.  All advice was taken to heart, if not directly used.  My friend\nfound out about the matter quite accidently.  After reading some of my\nmail, I quit from the mail reader & went about my business.  I must have\ntrashed my mail improperly, because he got on the same terminal the next\nday & saw my old messages.  He thought they were responses to a post he\nplaced in alt.atheism earlier that week, so he read some of them before\nrealizing that they were for me.  I got a message from him the next day; he\napologized for reading my mail & said that he did not want to appear to be\na snoop.  He said that he would be willing to talk to me about his views &\ndidn't mind doing so, especially with a friend.  So we did.  I neither\nchanged his mind nor did he change mine, as that was not the point.  Now he\nknows where I'm coming from & now I know where he's coming from.  And all\nthat I can do is pray for him, as I've always done.\n\nI believe the reason that he & I "click" instead of "bash" heads is because\nI see Christianity as a tool for revolution, & not a tool for maintaining\nthe status quo.  To be quite blunt, I have more of a reason to reject God\nthan he does just by the fact that I am an African-American female. \nChristianity & religion have been used as tools to separate my people from\nthe true knowledge of our history & the wealth of our contributions to the\nworld society.  The "kitchen of heaven" was all we had to look forward to\nduring the slave days, & this mentality & second-class status still exists\ntoday.  I, too, have rejected\nan aspect of Christianity----that of the estabished church.  Too much\nhypocricy exists behind the walls of "God's house" beginning with the\nimages of a white Jesus to that of the members:  praise God on Sunday &\nraise hell beginning Monday.  God-willing, I will find a church home where\nI can feel comfortable & at-home, but I don't see it happening anytime\nsoon.
Here is another way of looking at it.\n\nWhen we die we are released from the arc of time, and able\nto comprehend our lives in toto.  To visit each moment in\ntime sequentially or all at once, but not able to alter the\nactions thoughts or feelings we had/have/will have in this \nlife.\n\nFrom that perspective, I posit that all will have direct knowledge\nof God, and be able to recognize at each moment of time wether\nwe were doing what we ought.  That the experience of having\nlived a life far from God will be an eternal torment.  That \nhaving lived a life of grace, will be an eternal joy.  That the \nresurrection of the body comes not from any physical reconstitution\nof our present forms, but knowledge of our present forms by our\nfully cognizant souls.\n\nAs an Aside:  If we were to be restricted for all time to\nour present form, would you opt for immortality?\n\nJames Sledd
He doesn't contradict himself.  The church is to last for all time.\nHowever, there are those who use the church to bolster themselves.  This\nis evident in many letters.  For instance, Paul talks about the\n"super-apostles" to the Corinthians (2 Corinthians 11-12), he mentions\nhow people will be led away by miracles, signs, and wonders (2\nThessalonians 2:9-12), he tells Timothy that it is clear that some will\nabandon the faith and teach lies (1 Timothy 4:1-3) and that some will\nsearch for teachers to suit what they want to hear (2 Timothy 4:3-4).\nSuch passages go throughout the letters and Jesus does warn about them\n(Matthew 24:4-14).  But look at the promise in this last part.  Verse\n14:  "And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole world\nas a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come."  Even today,\nthere are false teachings.  I can name two which I am well familiar\nwith:  the non-need of baptism and the "praying of Jesus into your life\nfor salvation".  Both are taught.  Both are DEAD wrong.  They have been\ntaken out of context from some verses, interpreted from others, and just\nplain made up.  The ONLY way Jesus taught is given in Luke 9:23-26 and\nLuke 14:25-33.  He then commands baptism in Matthew 28:18-20.  The\nchurch Jesus founded, though, is alive and well.  It's not being\npersecuted as much as back then (the laws won't allow it yet), but it is\nbeing persecuted.\n\nJoe Fisher
Be devoted to one another in brotherly love. Honor one another above\nyourselves.
I find this argument very strange, though not unfamiliar.\n\nAn analogy someone used a while back can perhaps illustrate it.\n\nSay, for example, there are people living on a volcanic island, and a group \nof geologists determine that a volcano is imminent. They warn the people on \nthe island that they are in danger, and should leave. A group of people on \nthe island is given the task of warning others of the danger.\n\nThey believe the danger is real, but others may not. \n\nDoes that mean that the first group are NECESSARILY arrogant in warning \nothers of the danger? Does it mean that they are saying that their beliefs \nare correct, and all others are false?\n\nSome might indeed react to opposition with arrogance, and behave in an \narrogant manner, but that is a personal idiocyncracy. It does not \nnecessarily mean that they are all arrogant.
Another guess to your salvation riddle would be "saved".
The argument for Luke's genealogy being that of Mary is very weak. According\nto Luke 3:23\n\n   And when he began his ministry, Jesus himself was about \n   thirty years of age, being supposedly the son of Joseph,\n   the son of Eli,\n\nAside from the fact that Mary is not mentioned, there are two possible\ninterpretations: either Joseph was her father or he was her brother.\nClearly this is not acceptable.  A third would be that Joseph, the son\nof Eli, was her Father and just happened to have the name as the man\nto whom she was betrothed. But that would seem to be grasping at\nstraws. The most straightforward interpretation is that Luke had no\nintention of tracing Mary's genealogy (in which case he would have\nnamed her) but that he traces her husband's, from David's son Nathan.\n\nThe Matthew descendant list most definitely traces down from David's\nson, Solomon, to Joseph.  Matthew 1:16 reads:\n\n   And to Jacob was born Joseph, the husband of Mary, by whom was born\n   Jesus, who is called Christ. \n\nThere are two apparent problems.  The first is, how to reconcile the\ntwo paternal genealogies - which diverge with the sons of David,\nSolomon and Nathan.  The second is, why is any genealogy of Joseph\nrelavent at all, if Joseph had nothing to do with it.  If Joseph was\nnot Jesus's physical father, then the original poster is quite\ncorrect, that claims for Jesus's messianic heritage are not based on\ntruth but only on appearances, whatever Jesus's divine nature was.\n\nThe second problem is easy, in my mind.  We assume that Joseph was not\ninvolved in the conception of Jesus in any way.  However, a Holy\nSpirit capable of working a physical conception in Mary is also\ncapable of employing the physical agency of Joseph's seed in this\nwork.  In our materialistic times we interpret viginity and its loss\nsolely in terms of a physical act, whereas it is really a matter of\npurity on a much higher level as well.  The important thing is that\nneither Mary nor Joseph was conscious of any union between them (they\nhad not "known"each other).  Thus the first gospel's dedication of\nhalf its opening chapter to the genealogy of Joseph is quite relevant\nto Jesus, the Virgin birth not- withstanding.\n\nTo the first question there is an answer that creates, to begin with, more\nproblems than it resolves.  It is that the two evangelists are relating \nthe births of two entirely different children of two entirely different\nsets of parents.  Except for the names of the parents and the child, and \nthe birthplace in Bethlehem there is no point in common between the two \nstories.  Matthew and Luke converge in their accounts only thirty years\nlater with the Baptism of Jesus in Jordan.  Rudolf Steiner offered his\nexplanation of how these accounts begin with two children and then converge\nwith their accounts of the one Jesus of Nazareth.  He did not derive his\nresolution from biblical study or speculation, or from other external\ndocuments, and the discussion of "how this could be" might bring us beyond\nthe limits of appropriateness for this newsgroup.  In any case, the\ndetails are described in Steiner's "The Spiritual Guidance of the Human \nBeing and of Humanity", "The Gospel of St. Luke", and "The Gospel of St.\nMatthew". \n\nWhether or not Rudolf Steiner's methods and explanation are accepted\nas valid, at least this interpretation resolves the apparent\ncontradictions of the two genealogies while leaving the text intact.\n\nAs for the passing of one's Jewishness through the mother, this was\nnever an issue with Jesus. No one ever questioned his or Mary's\nJewishness.  The issue of the genealogies has to do with his paternal\nline of descent from David, the king.
[insert deletion of Paul's and Aaron's discourse on anger, ref Galatians\n5:19-20]\n\nOh, but they definitely can be.  Please look at Colossians 3:5-10 and\nEphesians 4:25-27.  Emotions can be controlled and God puts very strong\nemphasis on self-control, otherwise, why would he have Paul write to\nTimothy so much about making sure to teach self-control? \n\n[insert deletion of remainder of paragraph]\n\n\nPlease, re-think and re-read for yourself, Joe.  Again, the issue is\nself-control especially over feelings and actions, for our actions stem\nfrom our feelings in many instances.  As for God giving in to his anger,\nthat comes very soon.
In the Bible, there are a lot of instances where God speaks\nto people, where a person just "came to know" some piece\nof information, where a person walks off into the desert\nfor "40 days", etc. With all of God's power He certainly can\ndo whatever He wants when He wants it. The Bible "ends"\nwith the book of Revelations. But does God's reign end there ? No.\nSo who can say for sure that God's messages are either no longer\nhappening or still happening ?\n\nI can now hear the clamor for proof. 8-)\nWith the cold response I've gotten from the past from this\ngroup, it's very hard to get the point across. I'll only\ngo over the physical stuff so that skeptics can look\nat documents stored somewhere. I've cited the uncorrupted\nbodies of saints before. They're still there. 8-)\nThe apparitions at Fatima, Portugal culminated in a miracle\nspecifically granted to show God's existence. That was\nthe spinning/descending of the sun. It was seen in several\ncountries. That event is "approved" by the Pope. Currently,\nimages of Mary in Japan, Korea, Yugoslavia, Philippines, Africa\nare showing tears (natural or blood). These are still under\ninvestigation by the Church. But realize that investigations\ntake decades to finish. And if the message is Christ will come\nin ten days, that's a bit too late, isn't it 8-).\nOther events under investigation are inner locutions ("coming\nto know"), stigmata (the person exhibits Christ's wounds. And\nthey don't heal. And doctor's don't know why).\nNon-believers are welcome to pore through documents, I'm sure.\n\nThis stuff is not like Koresh. Or Oral Roberts (give me $5M\nor God will call me home). It's free. Find out why they're\nhappening (as we ourselves are studying why). If anybody\ncan figure this out, tell us ! You can be of any religion.\nIf you have the resources, go to one of the countries I mentioned.\nThese are not "members only" events. God and Mary invites \neverybody.\n\nSo in conclusion (finally) ...\nWe RC's believe in the modern day manifestations of God and Mary.\nWe are scared to death sometimes although we're told not to.\nThere are more proofs and events. And that is why "not everything\nis in the Bible". Although in a lot of the apparitions, we are told\nto read the Bible.\n\nAs far as the Protestant vs. Catholics issue is concerned...\nIn the end, God's churches will unite. I'm not sure how.\nI have some idea. But the point is we shouldn't worry\nabout the "versus" part. Just do God's work. That's all\nthat matters. Unity will come.\n\nBTW, I'm just a plain person. I'm not the Pope's spokesperson.\nBut I am RC.\n\n--

Over the years, I have met Christians who are not associated with\nany local church and are not members of any local church. This is\nan issue that may be very personal, but is important.  What does\nthe Bible say about this and how can we encourage our friends with\nregard to this issue?
The story I related is one of the seven apparitions\napproved by our Church as worthy of belief.  It happened\nin La Salle, France.\n\nThe moral lesson of the story is:\n\nThe Lamb of God has been sacrificed and His blood has \nbeen used to cleanse us of our sins every moment as God perceives\nworthy of being done in Heaven.  Mary weeps for The Lamb and\nfor the rest of her offsprings.  This will continue while we \ndisobey God or sin against Him.  Mary, as a messenger, \nhas been given the task to make us be 'aware' of the evil\nserpent (communism, wars, famine, unfaithful, disobedience\nto God, etc.) running after the rest of her offsprings.   \nThe children who went astray by disobedience led by the dragon is \nbrought back by her peace and loving messages, reparations for sins, \nto obey God's commandments and be more worthy to be in the presence \nof The Lamb.\n\nAs she was conceived without sin to be worthy of bearing the\nSon of God in her womb, Mary has been preparing us, the Church,\nthe Body of Christ, for His second coming (making sure we are \nprotected from the dragon).  Also, she has been preparing the new \nEden, by reversing the deed of the ancient Eve.  The new Eden will be\nthe sanctuary of the righteous as judged by Christ in His\nnext coming.\n    \nI relate the story again:\n    I believe this and Mary, in one of her apparitions  \n    in 19th or 20th century, she appeared to these      \n    two children who tends goats and cows (I forgot     \n    the exact place).  She was  weeping and telling the \n    children that she is afraid she's "going to lose her\n    Son's arm".  She is mourning too for these          \n    townfolks because it was their fault that there     \n    would be drought in their harvest; not much good    \n    food again this year as it was last year.           \n                                                        \n    Mary tells the children:                            \n*    Most of the townfolks in this place worked whole    *\n*    week even on Sundays when they should be in church  *\n*    honoring God.  These townfolks swears and           *\n*    uses her Son's name in bad words.  That is          *\n    why her Son's arm is so heavy in pain.              \n    Then she asked them if they pray.  The children     \n    said "hardly".  She asked them to pray every        \n    morning and night.  When the children went back     \n    from work they had to tell somebody about this.     \n    When the news was spred and after thorough          \n*    investigation of the incident, the townfolks        *\n*    were converted and faith and obedience to God       *\n*    were restored in their community.                   *\n\n\nOnce again, the Lamb succeeds.
Adam, I just finished a study on this, not only looking at the\nprophecies themselves, but where they were fulfilled.  While going only\nthrough the OT, I found 508 references.  After starting to show their\nfulfillment, I found out that I had missed some, so needless to say I\ncannot post them here.  However, the study I did I intend to publish (I\nam in the process of organizing and showing the fulfillments, then I\nwill be ready to write and send it to a publisher).  With any luck\n(and/or free time) I should have it finally done sometime around\nSeptember (I hope).

I would like to get your opinions on this: when exactly does an engaged\ncouple become "married" in God's eyes?  Some say that if the two have\npublically announced their plans to marry, have made their vows to God, and\nare unswervingly committed to one another (I realize this is a subjective\nqualifier) they are married/joined in God's sight.\n\nSuppose they are unable to get before the altar right at the current time\nbecause of purely logistical reasons beyond their control.  What do you\nthink about this?\n\nPost or e-mail me with general responses.  If you need clarification as to\nwhat I am asking, please e-mail.\n\nThanks and God bless!
James Sledd asks:\n\n 1. What is the nature of eternal life?\n 2. How can we as mortals locked into space-time conceive of it?\n 2a. If the best we can do is metaphor/analogy, then what is the\n best metaphor?\n\nC S Lewis's essay THE WEIGHT OF GLORY deals with this question. I\nrecommend it enthusiastically. You might also read the chapter on\n"Heaven" in his book THE PROBLEM OF PAIN. He gives a fictional\ntreatment in his book THE GREAT DIVORCE. I have found all of these\nvery helpful.\n\nYou might also be helped by the treatment in Dante's DIVINE COMEDY.\nHeaven occupies the last third of the poem, but I cannot imagine\nreading it other than from the beginning. I urge you to use the\ntranslation by Dorothy L Sayers, available from Penguin Paperbacks.
I have a few minor problems with the article posted as proof of \nChrist's resurrection.  \n\nFirst the scriptural quotations:\n\nThis sort of reasoning is such that if you beleive you are justified,\nif not then your beleif is in vain, so you might as well beleive.  Most\nof these quotations are of people who do beleive.  People who would\ntry to justify their own positions.\n\nSecond the logical proof:\n\n\n The period of time that has elapsed from the event growing larger\ndoes not increase the odds that a hoax would be discovered.  In fact\nthe longer a hoax is perpetuated the stronger it becomes.\n\nFinally:\n\nThere is no proof of the resurrection of Christ, except in our spirits\ncommunion with his, and the Father's.  It is a matter of FAITH, belief\nwithout logical proof.  Incedently one of the largest stumbling blocks for\nrational western man, myself included.
Even if there was no independent proof that Luke's account was\nvalid, I find it strange that you would take the negation of it as\ntruth without any direct historical evidence (at least that you've\nmentioned) to back it up.  The assertion was made, unequivocally\nthat no Christian ever sufferred for their faith by believing in\nthe Resurrection.  Luke's account suggests otherwise, and in the\nabsence of direct eyewitnesses who can claim that Luke is mistaken,\nthen I suggest that this unequivocal assertion is suspect.\n\n\n\n-- \nJohn G.

It was an answer to the claim that the witnesses couldn't\nbe lying because they were willign to suffer for their beliefs.\nThus it's not necessary to show that no Christian ever suffered\nfor believing in the Resurrection.  Rather the issue is whether\nthose who witnessed it did.\n\nI do agree that the posting you're responding to shows that there\ncan be liberal as well as conservative dogmatism.
Just a quick reminder:  \n\n	The way you are interpreting those passages is your opinion.  You make\n	it sound as if your opinion is somehow an undisputable fact.\n\n	Many would interpret the passages you cite very differently.\n\n	(Many have--several of the great theologians you mentioned do that \n	very thing.  These were people who had much more expertise in the\n	interpretation of scripture than you or me or probably anyone reading\n	this newsgroup.  To say that all of them are wrong and you are right\n	is, in my opinion, (notice those last three words) coming pretty darn\n	close to the sin of pride.  \n\n	In the future I would suggest you not be so absolutist in your \n	interpretations, especially when contradicting highly respected\n	doctors of Christianity.
Hi,\n\nI don't know much about Bible. Could you tell me the relations of\nChristians with non-Christians in Bible? How should be The relations of\nchristian nations with each other and the relations of Christian nations\nwith other nations who are not Christians?\n\nThe other question is about the concept of religion in Bible. Does the\nreligion of God include and necessitate any law to be extracted from\nBible or is the religion only a belief and nothing to do with the\ngovernment sides? If for example, any government or a nation is one of\nthe wrongdoings according to Bible, how should they be treated? \n\nIs there any statement in Bible saying that Bible is a guide for every\naspects of life?  \n\nThank you.

Andrew,\n\n   How I wish this were true, and how I long for the day in which it will\nbe true.  But alas, it is not true of history.  The Bible does not have a \nmessage -- it has messages.  And some of those are messages of repentance and\ngiving, to turn the other cheek, and do unto the least of these.  But some\nof the messages are the complete opposite.  Like the isrealites order to \nwipe out other tribes including women and children down to cattle, and \npunished severely when they were less than complete about the job.  Like\njews who are said to have cried out in Matthew, "His blood be upon our heads\nand our childrens heads" A verse quoted in every pogrom from the crusades to\nthe holocaust.  Have these been misunderstood?  I think not.  They have only\nbeen understood too clearly.  It is essential that christians grasp firmly\nthe good the bible teaches, the meek carpenter from Nazareth is a potent \nsymbol for how we should be, his teachings we must take to heart, but we\ncannot ignore the other material in the bible which is not to our liking and\nsay those who live by that have misread it.  To say that is only to chose a\npoint of interpretation and declare it normative.  Such can be done with the\nsame legitmacy by anyone.  Instead we must let the text critique the text.\nUnderstanding that there is both good and bad in our sacred corpus, we test\nall things and hold fast to that which is good. \n\nAt the risk of sounding heretical (well ok, more heretical) I don't think\nthat doubt is something which requires forgiveness, it is something which\nrequires introspection and reflection.  If that is a sin, then there can\nbe no salvation, for doubt is an inescapble part of being human.  Consider\nJob.  His friends had no doubt. Whereas Job had no doubt in himself but\ndoubted the wisdom and justice of God.  When God finally did appear he \nrebuked the friends and had job make sacrifices for them.  To be a Christian\nit to always have doubt, or not to have honesty.
Dear Netters:\n\nA new religious newsgroup "soc.religion.islam.ahmadiyya" was pro-\nposed  on  Oct  16,  1992. The discussion about this new proposed\nnewsgroup went on in various related groups.

The moderators have been\ndecided through personal e-mail and through a  general  consensus\namong  the proponants by discussion in news.groups. The following\nmoderators have been proposed and agreed upon:\n\nModerator:     Nabeel A.

The founder of this\nsect, Hazrat Mirza Ghulam Ahmad (1835-1908), proclaimed to be the\nPromised Reformer of this age as foretold in almost all the major\nreligions of the world today (Islam, Christianity, Judiasm,  Hin-\nduism).  He  claimed  to  be  the  long awaited second comming of\nJesus Christ (metaphorically), the Muslim Mahdi, and the Promised\nMessiah.  He  claimed that the prophecies contained in almost all\nthe great religions of the world about the advent of a  messenger\nfrom God have been fulfilled.\n\n        The claims Hazrat Ahmad raised storms  of  hostility  and\nextreme  oposition from many priestlike people of Muslims, Chris-\ntians, Jews and Hindus of that age. Such opposition is often wit-\nnessed  in  the history of divine reformers. Even today this sect\nis being persecuted specially in  some  of  the  Muslim  regimes.\nDispite  the  opposition  and persecution, this sect has won many\nadherents in 130 countries. It has over 10 million followers, who\ncome from a diverse ethnic and cultural background.\n\n        The sect is devoted to world peace and in bringing  about\na better understanding of religion, and the founders of all reli-\ngions. Its mission is to unite mankind into one Universal  broth-\nerhood  and  develop  a  better  understanding  of  faith. Ahmadi\nMuslims have always been opposed to all kind of violence and spe-\ncially religious intollerance and fundamentalism.\n\n        Among its many philanthropic activities, the sect has es-\ntablished  a network of hundreds of schools, hospitals, and clin-\nics in many third world countries. These institutions are staffed\nby  volunteer  professional  and are fully financed by the sect's\ninternal resources.\n\n        The Ahmadiyya mission is to bring about a universal moral\nreform,  establish  peace and justice, and to unite mankind under\none universal religion.\n\n\nNEWSGROUP CREATION: \n==================
I don't know why it is so obvious.  We are not speaking of acts of the \nflesh.  We are just speaking of emotions.  Emotions are not of themselves\nmoral or immoral, good or bad.  Emotions just are.  The first step is\nnot to label his emotion as good or bad or to numb ourselves so that\nwe hide our true feelings, it is to accept ourselves as we are, as God\naccepts us.  It seems that Paul's anger he has accepted and channeled\nit to a plea to all of us to refrain from passing judgement on those\nafflicted with a disease and to reach out to others.  Give in?  Calling\nhis arguments foolish, belittling them to only quarrels, avoiding action\nbecause of fear to give others a bad feeling, he's not forgiving?\n\nRe-think it, Aaron.  Don't be quick to judge.  He has forgiven those with\nAIDS, he has dealt with and taken responsibility for his feelings and made\nappropriate choices for action on such feelings.  He has not given in to\nhis anger.
Are 'Moody Monthly' and 'Moody' the same magazine (name change in recent\nyears)?\n\nIf not: Could someone post the address to 'Moody Monthly'?\n\n:)avid
Why do we follow God so blindly?  Have you ever asked a\nphysically blind person why he or she follows a seeing eye dog?\nThe answer is quite simple--the dog can see, and the blind person\ncannot.\n\n	I acknowledge, as a Christian, that I am blind.  I see,\nbut I see  illusions as well as reality.  (Watched TV lately?)\nI hear, but I hear lies as well as truth.  (Listen to your \nradio or read a newspaper.)  Remember, all that tastes well is\nnot healthy.  So, I rely one the one who can see, hear, and\ntaste everything, and knows what is real, and what is not.\nThat is God.\n\n	Of course, you may ask, if I cannot trust my own senses,\nhow do I know whether what I see and hear about God is truth or\na lie.  That is why we need faith to be saved.  We must force\nourselves to believe that God knows the truth, and loves us\nenough to share it with us, even when it defies what we think\nwe know.  Why would He have created us if He did not love us \nenough to help us through this world?\n\n	I also do trust my experiences to some extent.  When\nI do things that defy the seeming logic of my experience, \nbecause it is what my Father commands me to do, and I see\nthe results in the long term, I find that He has led me\nin the proper direction, even though it did not feel right\nat the time.  This is where our works as Christians are\nimportant:  As exercises of the body make the body strong,\nexcercises of faith make the faith strong.  \n\n	As for you, no one can "convert" you.  You must\nchoose to follow God of your own will, if you are ever to\nfollow Him.  All we as Christians wish to do is share with\nyou the love we have received from God.  If you reject that,\nwe have to accept your decision, although we always keep\nthe offer open to you.  If you really want to find out\nwhy we believe what we believe, I can only suggest you try\npraying for faith, reading the Bible, and asking Christians\nabout their experiences personally.  Then you may grow to\nunderstand why we believe what we do, in defiance of the\nlogic of this world.\n\n	May the Lord bring peace to you,
I appreciate if anyone can point out some good books about the dead sea\nscrolls of Qumran. Thanks in advance.
I believe this is a just another of way of expressing the basic truth\n"All things were created by him and FOR him." (emphasis mine) \nCol. 1:16 , Rev. 4:11. If you and I have been created for God, naturally\nthere will be a vacuum if God is not our all and all. In fact,\nthe first chapter of Collosians brings out this status of Christ, that\nHe should have the preeminence. When you life is alligned with Him,\nand you do His will, then the vacuum is filled.
Again I find myself wanting to respond to a posting and having neither\nthe time nor the proper materials with me (you would think I would learn my\nlesson by now--but I'm trying to finish writing my Thesis and don't have tons\nof time.  Anyway...)\n\n	The basis for our (the catholic church's) belief in the assumption of\nMary, body and soul, into heaven is that, to put it simply, the apostles \nand all the early generation Christians believed it.  In fact, throughout their\nministry the apostles kept in close contact with Mary, and 11 of the 12 were\npresent when she died.  Only Thomas was missing--when he arrived several days\nlater, he asked to be shown her body, and moved with pity, Peter and several of\nthe other apostles brought him to her tomb.  When they arrived the seal was\nstill unbroken.  They broke the seal, entered, and the body was missing.  There\nwas no sign that anyone had entered, forcibly or otherwise, and everything else\nwas laid out exactly as it had been left.  The apostles present all believed\nthat Mary was assumed into heaven--and the apostles TAUGHT this in their  \npreaching (of course, this does not appear in any of the texts currently \nconsidered part of the bible, but it does appear in other writings left behind\nby several of them.)  Basicaly, as an apostolic church (ie. founded by the\napostles), we believe that the teachings of the apostles, whether written down\nin the bible or written down in other sources, is true, providing that the\nauthenticity of those other sources can be confirmed.  At least in the case of\nthe assumption of Mary, the authenticity is quite clear.
I finished reading a very good book, "The Will of God", Weatherhead.\nThis was very helpful to me in applying thought to the subject of the\nwill of God.\n\nWeatherhead broke the will of God into three distinct parts;\nintentional will, circumstancial will, and ultimate will.  He\n(Weatherhead) also refuted the last statement (above) by Michael\nParkin above quite nicely.\n\nSummarizing; _despite_ the failures of humankind, God's ultimate will\nis never to be defeated.  God's intentions may be interfered with,\neven temporarily defeated by the will of humankind, brought down by\ncircumstance.  His ultimate will (the reconcilication of all\nhumankind) will never be stopped.\n\nTime after time, Weatherhead used the Cross as the best description of\nthis process at work.  His points, paraphrased, were 1) God's\nintentional will was for Jesus, the Christ, to live out a full life\nand perform the work of the Living God.  2) The failures, sins, and\ndeviousness of humankind frustrated God's intent for His Son.  3)\nDespite the circumstance, God's ultimate will was revealed in the\nCross, as Jesus willingly ("not my will, Lord, but yours") died for\nthe redemption of all humankind.  The Cross was utterly triumphant,\novercoming even the most cruel of circumstances.\n\n\nIt was not the intentional will of God.  It was the circumstancial\nwill, thus enabling the victory of the ultimate will.\n\n\n\nRight, intentional will.\n\n(Just like the Jewish people\n\nWe know neither the time nor the place.  He will return as a thief in the night.\n\nPeace.\n\nRob
There is a certain truth to this statement. Only I would use the word\n"medicine" instead of drug.  With regard to the condition of the human\nsoul, Christianity is first and foremost a healing medicine.  It also\nstrengthens and enables one, as healing takes hold, to grow in new\nstrength and health to live and be and to do that for which God created \nus.\n\n\nChrist's medicine, rightly allowed to work, brings one nearer to\nreality and offers the clarity of understanding and the strength\nof spirit with which to meet it in a healthy human way.\n\n\n(small spelling correction added)
[FAQ and Darius' response deleted]\n\n\n\nI am myself an SDA and I am in total agreement with what Darius has to say.  \nI also worship on Saturday to honor the Lord.  Your mention of "[esteeming] \nall days alike" IMO has to do with the fast days observed by the Jews.  But \nno matter how you interpret that passage, I do accept your worship on Sunday \nas being done in honor of the Lord, in contrast with what many of my fellow \nSDA believers may believe.  To me, though, the bible overwhelmingly points \nto Saturday as the day to be kept in honor of creation and of God's \ndeliverance of the Israelites from Egyptian bondage.  To those who would \nattempt to point out that my observance of Saturday is being legalistic, \nthis is simply not the case.  Rather, keeping Saturday allows me a full day \nto rest and contemplate God's goodness and grace.\n\n\n\nThe idea was introduced to me once that the reason Paul wanted the \nCorinthians to lay aside money for the collection on the first day of the \nweek was because that was when they received their weekly wages.  Paul \nwanted them to lay aside money for the collection as first priority, before \nspending their money on other things.  I do not have any proof in front of \nme for this though, although it would explain why they would lay aside money \nin their homes instead of a meeting.  \n\n\nIt would seem to me that you assume that the christians in the NT regularly \nworshipped on the first day.  I assume that the christians in the NT \nregularly worshipped on the seventh day.  But I agree with you that we only \nhave implications because the authors did assume the reader knew when worhip \nwas.
i have a question for you all related to this.  jesus condemns divorce\nseveral times in the new testament, and i have a hard time with this.\nthe catholic church (as far as i can tell) does grant annulments with\nthe statement that the marriage never really existed in God's eyes.\n(please, if i am mistinterpreting, correct me.)  however, i have\nwitnessed marriages where two people were very much in love but\nrecognized that they were destroying themselves and each other by\nstaying in a marriage, and that the problems were due to personal\nchildhood issues that had never been resolved.  i ask you, is divorce\njustified in such a case?  they knew who they were, what they were\ndoing, they were deeply in love, but in the end, it did not work out.\ni must admit that i don't see jesus forcing them to live together, or\neven condemning that they go and seek happiness with someone else\nlater on.  opinions?\n\nvera\n*******************************************************************************\nI am your CLOCK!     |  I bind unto myself today    | Vera Noyes\nI am your religion!  |  the strong name of the	    | noye@midway.uchicago.edu\nI own you!	     |  Trinity....		    | no disclaimer -- what\n	- Lard	     |	- St. Patrick's Breastplate | is there to disclaim?\n*******************************************************************************
My, this distinction seems quite arbitrary.\n\n  Blessed is the man whose iniquities are forgiven, whose sin is covered.\n  (Ps. 32:1).\n\nand quoted by the apostle Paul:\n\n  Even as David also describeth the blessedness of the man, unto whom God\n  imputeth righteousness without works,\n  Saying, Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins\n  are covered.\n  Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin.  (Rom. 4:6-8)\n\nThe biblical perspective seems to be that foregiveness and covering are\nparallel/equivalent concepts in both testaments.  The dispensational\ndistinction is unwarranted.\n\n\nI'm sure Rex has Scripture to back this up.  You're suggesting Jesus is\ngoing to travel around dealing with individual violations of His law -- for\nmillions perhaps billions of people.  Such activity for Moses the lawgiver\nwas considered unwise (cf. Ex. 18:13ff).  It makes for interesting\nspeculation, though.\n\nI'll leave comments on the so-called "bema seat" vs. "throne" judgments to\nsomeone else.  This also seems like more unnecessary divisions ala\ndispensationalism.
LISTOWNER: I have sent this to Mr Anderson privately. Post it only\nif you think it of general interest.\n\nHere is a copy of something I wrote for another list. You may\nfind it relevant.\n\nA listmember asks:\n\n > What makes common-law marriages wrong?\n\nA common-law marriage is not necessarily wrong in itself. There is\nnothing in the Bible (Old or New Testament) about getting married by\na preacher, or by a priest (Jewish or Christian). And in fact Jewish\npriests have never had any connection with weddings.\n\nThere is a common notion that the marriage is performed by the\nclergyman. In fact, the traditional Christian view (at least in the\nWest) is that the bride and groom are the ministers of the marriage,\nand that the clergyman is there only as a witness.\n\nHOWEVER!\n\nThe essential ingredient of a marriage is mutual commitment. Two\npersons are considered to be married if and only if they have bound\nthemselves by mutual promises to live together as husband and wife,\nforsaking all others, till death do them part.\n\n      The reason why those who have reason to be concerned about who\nis married to whom have always insisted on some kind of public\nceremony is in order that society, and the couple themselves, may be\nclear about whether a commitment has been made.\n\nSuppose that we do away with the public ceremony, the standard vows,\netc. Instead, we have a man and a woman settling down to live\ntogether.\n      After a year or so, the man says to the woman: Hey, honey, it\nwas great while it lasted, but I think it's time to move on.\nyounger.\nocean, as eternal as the stars. As long as I live, I am yours,\nutterly and completely. When I lie on my deathbed, my last feeble\nbreath will utter your name. My..."\nman is in a romantic mood, he is bound to say all kinds of silly\nthings like that. You mustn't take them literally.\n\nAnd that is why you have an insistence on a formal ceremony that is\na matter of public record.\n      The Church insists on it, because it is her duty (among other\nthings) to give moral advice, and you cannot give a man moral advice\nabout his relations with a woman if you have no idea who is married\nto whom, if anybody, and vice versa.\n      The State insists on it, since the state has a concern with\nproperty rights, with child care and support, and therefore needs to\nknow who has made what commitments to whom.\n      Prospective fathers-in-law insist on it, because they don't\nwant their daughters seduced and abandoned.\n      Prospective spouses insist on it, because they want to make\nsure they know whether what they are hearing is a real commitment,\nor just "poetry."\n      And persons making vows themselves insist on making them\nformally and publicly, in order that they may be clear in their own\nminds about what it is that they are doing, and may know themselves\nthat this is not just rhetoric. This is the real thing.\n\n      Hence the insistence on a formal public explicit avowal of the\nmarriage commitment.  The Church goes further and insists that, when\nChristians marry, a clergyman shall be present at the wedding and\nrecord the vows on behalf of the Church, not because it is\nimpossible to have a valid wedding without a clergyman, but in order\nto make sure that the couple understand what the Christian teaching\nabout marriage is, and that they are in fact promising to be married\nin a Christian sense. The Church also prefers a standard marriage\nvow, and is wary of letting couples Write their own vows, for much\nthe same reason that lawyers prefer standard terminology when they\ndraw up a will or a contract. Certain language has been repeatedly\nused in wills, and one can be sure how the courts will interpret it.\nTry to say the same thing in your own words, and you may find that\nthe probate judge's interpretation of them is not at all what you\nintended.  Similarly, the Church prefers to avoid endless debates\nabout whether "You are my main squeeze" and "I am here for the long\nhaul" do in fact cover the same territory as "forsaking all others"\nand "till death do us part."\n\n      This topic has come up on the list before. (Is there any topic\nthat hasn't?) One listmember was asking, "If a couple love each\nother and are living together, isn't that marriage in the eyes of\nGod?" Eventually someone asked, "In that case, what is their status\nif they break up? Is that the moral equivalent of getting a divorce?\nAre they in a relationship that God forbids either of them to walk\nof that!" In fact, there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that\nsomeone who says, "We don't need a piece of paper or a ceremony in\nfront of a judge or a preacher in order to show that we love each\nother," is trying to have it both ways -- to have the advantages of\nmarriage plus the option of changing his mind with a minimum of\nbother.\n\nAt this point someone may say, "None of this applies to me and my\nmate. We are quite clear on the fact that we have assumed a lifelong\ncommitment, 'for better or worse, forsaking all others, till death\nus do part.' So in our case, no ceremony is needed."\n     To this my reply would be: The reason for requiring a driver's\nlicense is to keep dangerous drivers off the road.  What is wrong in\nitself is not the existence of unlicensed drivers, but the existence\nof dangerous drivers. However, testing and licensing drivers is an\nobvious and reasonable means of pursuing the goal of reducing the\nnumber of dangerous drivers on the road. Therefore the State rightly\nmakes and enforces such laws, and you the citizen have a positive\nmoral obligation to refrain from driving without a license no matter\nhow much of a hotshot behind the wheel you think you are.\n\nBack to the original question. We have a listmember who knows a\ncouple who have been living together for around 20 years. He asks:\nAt what point did they stop fornicating and start being married? I\nanswer: at the point, if any, where they both definitely and\nexplicitly accepted an obligation to be faithful to each other, for\nbetter or worse, as long as they both lived. If they have accepted\nsuch an obligation, what are their reasons for not being willing to\ndeclare it in front of, say, a justice of the peace?
I don't meant to defend Eric Molas- I find it somewhat annoying when\nsomeone pops up on alt.atheism to tell us all about his (usually\natheistic) beliefs, so I can certainly see how Christians might be\nannoyed- but I'd like to point out a few things.\n\n\n"no meaning from God" is not the same as "no meaning". From my (atheistic)\npoint of view, if you want meaning in your life, you get to go and\nget some or make some.\n\nNo free gifts of meaning. (I never quite understood how any\nGod can just "give" your life meaning, actually. If he\nsays you exists to do or be X, that gives you a purpose\nif you care to accept it, but is that the same thing? But\nI digress...) \n\n\nThis would truely be a miserably existance, which I doubt Eric\nendures. Life can be enjoyable, so you can live it because you like\nit, or purposefull, so you can live it to get something done. One should\nendeavour to make it so, if it is not. Otherwise it would be as you say.\nTerrible.\n\n\nProbably true. Remeber he almost certainly sees that particular joy as\nan illusion, and does not want it. So maybe it isn't so bad?\n\n\nAs an atheist, I am free to be a human person. I think, love, choose,\nand create.\n\n\nAh, now here we begin to diverge. I will not live forever\nwith anyone.\n\n(I don't think you will either, but you are welcome to your\nopinion on the matter.)\n\n\nI tend to agree with you.\n\nIt's my opinion that (unlike drugs) religions are normal\nparts of human societies.\n\nI think they have outlived their usefullness, but they\nare evidently quite ordinary, normal things that haven't\nproved lethal to humanity yet.\n\n\nI have heard this claim quite a few times. Does anybody here know\nwho first came up with the "God-shaped hole" business?\n\n\nYou might want to provide some evidence next time you make a claim\nlike this.\n\n\nI don't know Eric, but I do not think it is wise to assume he has a less\njoy-filled and abundant life because he holds certain beliefs.\n\n---\n			- Dan Johnson\nAnd God said "Jeeze, this is dull"... and it *WAS* dull.

Typical statement from an irrational and brainwashed person.\nThe bible was written by some male chavnist thousands of years ago\n(as were all of the "holy" books). Follow the parts that you think are\nsuitable for modern life. Ignore the others. For heaven's (!) sake don't\ntake it literally.\n\n				^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\n	So you think it is easy to be a Muslim? Or be a Buddhist?\nThe Buddha's commandments are 500 yrs older than Christ's and in\nmy opinion tougher to follow. Moreover the Buddha says that we are \nintrinsically good (as against Christ's "we are all sinners").\n Only we allow ourselves to be distracted. By meditating we can awaken \nourselves (etc etc). Also there is no concept of God in Buddhism. \n(In my opinion you can be an Atheist and a Buddhist).\nBut to "awaken" yourself is no easy task. Can you stay away from eating meat?\nCan you sit still and think of nothing (meditate) for sometime everyday?\nBuddhists do (or are supposed to). Can you pray five times a day? \nCan you fast for a month every year (Ramzan). Are you willing\nto give 1/6 th of your income as tithe? Muslims do. In fact I think \nJesus was an ordinary man (just as Buddha and Mohamed) probably with a \nphilosopy ahead of the times (where he lived). \nConsidering the fact that Christianity is a young religion\n(compared to Hindiusm, Judaism, Zorasterism, Buddihsm) it is also very\nprobable that the Bible is merely a collection of borrowed ideas.\n(There was a good deal of trade between the eastern lands and the\nmiddle east at the time of Christ).\nAnd perhaps some more. But leave the crap in it out ("woman was created\nafter man, to be his helper" etc).\naras\n\n	\n\n\n	When ever I turn on my TV there is this Pat Robertson and\nother brain washers (Oh boy, what an act they put on!) with an\n1-800 number to turn in your pledges.\nGod it seems is alive and well inside these boxes.
Someone sent me this FAQ by E-mail and I post my response here.\n\n[I'm not enforcing the inclusion limits on this FAQ because most\nof our readers probably haven't seen it.  --clh]\n\nChrist warns that anyone who "breaks one of the least of these\ncommandments *and* teaches otheres to do the same will be called least in\nthe kingdom of heaven" (Matt. 5:19.  This FAQ is so full of error that I\nmust respond to it.  I hope that whoever maintains will remove from it the\npartisan theology.\n\n\n1.  The law was known to man before it was revealed on Mount Sinai.  Rom\n4:15 notes that "where no law is, there is no transgression."  Not only\ndid sin exist before Sinai (Eden), but the Sabbath was kept before it\nwas revealed on Sinai (Ex 16).\n\n2.  The problem with the first covenant was not the law, but the promise\nwhich undergirded it.  God wanted to perform his will in the lives of the\npeople, but in their ignorance after 400 years of slavery, they promised\n"what ever He says to do we will do."  That is why the new covenant is\nbased on "better promises" (Heb. 8:6).  Rather than do away with the law\nGod promised to "put my laws in their minds and write them on their\nhearts" (Heb. 8:10).\n\n3.  Including the Sabbath in the Acts 15 is selective inclusion.  The\nSabbath was more important to the Jews than circumcision.  If any attempt\nhad been made to do away with the Sabbath the reaction would have been\neven more strident than is recorded in Acts 15.  Do not confuse the weekly\nSabbath of the Decalogue with the ceremonial sabbaths which could occur at\nany time of the week and were part of the law (ceremonial) which was\n*added* because of transgression (of the moral law) (Gal 3:19).\n\n4.  Israel stands for God's people of all time.  That is why God *grafted*\nthe Gentiles in.  Roma 9:4 says that the adoption, the glory, the\ncovenants, the giving of the law, the service of God and the promises\nbelong to Israelites.   In explanation Paul makes it clear that being born\ninto Israel is not enough "For they are not all Israel, which are of\nIsrael" v 6.  Then in Gal 3:19 he says "if ye be Christ's, then are ye\nAbraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise."  All Christians are\nAbraham's seed, Jews, Israelites.  Not physically, for that is not the\ncriterion, but spiritually.  We are joint heirs with Jesus based on the\npromise God made to all his people the Israelites.\n\n\nPeople would probably agree but they are wrong.  How can the Sabbath\ncommandment be ceremonial when it is part of a law which predates the\nceremonial laws?  You are not free to choose your time of worship.  Even\nif you were why do you follow a day of worship which has its origins in pagan\nsun worship.  Would you rather give up a day which God blessed,\nsanctified, and hallowed in exchange for one which all church leaders\nagree has not biblical foundation (see Sabbath Admissions in\nsoc.religion.christian.bible-study).\nI do not care what Calvin or any theologian says.  My guide is what God\nsays.  If being not under the law means we do not have to keep the law,\nwhy is it that the only section of the law we have trouble with is the\nSabbath commandment, which is the only one God thought was important\nenough to say *REMEMBER*?  If you study the word deeply you will note that\nthe message is that we are no longer under the condemnation of the law but\nfreed by the grace of God.  If a cop pulls me over for speeding, then in\ncourt I ask for mercy and the judge does not throw the book at me but gives me\ngrace, do I walk out of the court saying "I can now go on speeding, for I\nam now under grace?"  Being under grace I now drive within the speed\nlimit.  Paul adds to it in Rom. 3:31 "Di we then make void the law through\nfaith?  God forbid: yea, we establish the law."  "Wherefore the law is\nholy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good" (Rom. 7:12).\n\n\nDo you prefer implication to fact?  A careful study of the Acts 20 shows\nthat the meeting was on Saturday night and that on Sunday morning Paul did\nnot go to a worship service, but set off on a long journey by foot to\nAssos.  In ICor 16 there is no way you can equate "lay by him in store"\nwith "go to a worship service."\n\nWrong.  These are the sabbath days of the ceremonial law, not the Sabbath\nday of the moral law.\nWhy would you prefer to twist and turn, relying on different arguments\nwhich conflict with each other, rather than obey a simple request from a\nGod who loved you enough to die for you.  Jesus died because the law could\nnot be changed.  Why bother to die in order to meet the demands of a\nbroken law if all you need to do is change the law.  Penalties for law\nbreaking means the law is immutable.  That is why it is no sin not to\nfollow the demands of the ceremonial laws.  It will always be a sin to\nmake false gods, to violate God's name, to break the Sabbath, to steal, to\nkill, etc.  Except it you disagree.  But then your opinion has no weight\nwhen placed next to the word of God.\n\nDarius\n\n[It's not clear how much more needs to be said other than the FAQ.  I\nthink Paul's comments on esteeming one day over another (Rom 14) is\nprobably all that needs to be said.  I accept that Darius is doing\nwhat he does in honor of the Lord.  I just wish he might equally\naccept that those who "esteem all days alike" are similarly doing\ntheir best to honor the Lord.\n\nHowever I'd like to be clear that I do not think there's unambiguous\nproof that regular Christian worship was on the first day.  As I\nindicated, there are responses on both of the passages cited.\n\nThe difficulty with both of these passages is that they are actually\nabout something else.  They both look like they are talking about\nnnregular Christian meetings, but neither explicitly says "and they\ngathered every Sunday for worship".  We get various pieces of\ninformation, but nothing aimed at answering this question.  \n\nAct 2:26 describes Christians as participating both in Jewish temple\nworship and in Christian communion services in homes.  Obviously the\ntemple worship is on the Sabbath.  Acts 13:44 is an example of\nChristians participating in them.  Unfortunately it doesn't tell us\nwhat day Christians met in their houses.  Acts 20:7, despite Darius'\nconfusion, is described by Acts as occuring on Sunday.  (I see no\nreason to impose modern definitions of when days start, when the\nBiblical text is clear about what was meant.)  The wording implies to\nme that this was a normal meeting.  It doesn't say they gathered to\nsee Paul off, but that when they were gathered for breaking bread,\nPaul talked about his upcoming travel.  But that's just not explicit\nenough to be really convincing.  Similarly with 1 Cor 16:2.  It says\nthat on the first day they should set aside money for Paul's\ncollection.  Now if you want to believe that they gathered specially\nto do this, or that they did it in their homes, I can't disprove it,\nbut the obvious time for a congregation to take an offering would be\nwhen they normally gather for worship, and if they were expected to do\nit in their homes there would be no reason to mention a specific day.\nSo I think the most obvious reading of this is that "on the first day\nof every week" simply means every time they gather for worship.  \n\nI think the reason we have only implications and not clear statements\nis that the NT authors assumed that their readers knew when Christian\nworship was.
for SRC\n\nIn most languages, the Feast of the Resurrection of Our Lord is\nknown as the PASCH, or PASQUE, or some variation thereof, a word\nwhich comes from the Hebrew PESACH, meaning "Passover." In English,\nGerman, and a few related languages, however, it is known as EASTER,\nor some variation thereof, and questions have been asked about the\norigin of this term.\n\nOne explanation is that given by the Venerable Bede in his DE\nRATIONE TEMPORUM 1:5, where he derives the word from the name of an\nAnglo-Saxon goddess of Spring called EASTRE. Bede is a great\nscholar, and it is natural to take his word for it. But he lived\n673-735, and Augustine began preaching in Kent in 597. The use of\nthe word EASTER to describe the Feast would have been well\nestablished before the birth of Bede and probably before the birth\nof anyone he might have discussed the subject with. It seems likely\nthat his derivation is just a guess, based on his awareness that\nthere had been an Anglo-Saxon goddess of Spring bearing that name,\nand the resemblance of the words. Thus, if the said resemblance\n(surely it is not surprising that a personification of Spring should\nhave a name similar to the word for Dawn) is not in istelf\nconvincing, the testimony (or rather the conjecture) by Bede does\nnot make it more so.\n\nAssuming that Bede was right, that would not justify saying that the\nChristian celebration (which, after all, had been going on for some\ncenturies before the name EASTER was applied to it) has pagan roots.\nIt would simply mean that the Anglo-Saxons, upon becoming Christians\nand beginning to celebrate the Resurrection by a festival every\nspring, called it by the name that to them meant simply "Spring\nFestival."\n\nHowever, Bede's is not the only theory that has been proposed.  J\nKnoblech, in "Die Sprach," ZEITSCHRIFT FUER SPRACHWISSENSCHAFT 5\n(Vienna, 1959) 27-45, offers the following derivation:\n\nAmong Latin-speaking Christians, the week beginning with the Feast\nof the Resurrection was known as "hebdomada alba" (white week),\nsince the newly-baptized Christians were accustomed to wear their\nwhite baptismal robes throughout that week. Sometimes the week was\nreferred to simply as "albae." Translaters rendering this into\nGerman mistook it for the plural of "alba," meaning "dawn." They\naccordingly rendered it as EOSTARUM, which is Old High German for\n"dawn." This gave rise to the form EASTER in English.\n\n Yours,\n James Kiefer
In an earlier article, I explained that what many people find arrogant about\nChristians is that some Christians profess absolute certianty about their\nbeliefs and doctrines.  That is, many Christians insist that they CANNOT have\nmade any mistakes when discovering their beliefs, which amounts to saying\nthat they are infallible.\n\nImpicitly claiming to be infallible is pretty arrogant, most of us will\nprobably agree.\n\nIn short, the problem is that no matter how good your sources are, if any\npart of your doctrines or beliefs rest on your own thinking and reasoning,\nthen those doctrines are suspect.  So long as your own brain is involved,\nthere is a possibility for error.  I summarised the problem by writing "There\nis no way out of the loop."\n\n\nSomeone called `REXLEX' has claimed that there IS a way out of the loop, but\nhe did not bother to explain what it was, preferring instead to paraphrase\nSartre, ramble about Wittgenstein, and say that the conclusion of my argument\nleads to relativism.\n\nAs I have explained to him before, you cannot reject an argument as false\nbecause you dislike where it leads: the facts do not change just because\n\n\nHowever, as any first-year philosophy student can explain, what `REXLEX' has\nwritten does not constitute a refutation.  All he has said is that he does\nnot like what I wrote -- he has done nothing at all to dispute it.\n\n *\n\nThere were two sentences in `REXLEX's post that seemed relevant to the\npoint at hand:\n\n\nI do not dispute that some truths can be verified through experience.  I\nhave, for example, direct experience of adding numbers.  I don't claim to\nbe infallible at it -- in fact I remember doing sums incorrectly -- but I\ndo claim that I have direct experience of reasoning about numbers.\n\nHowever, once we go past experiencing things and start reasoning about\nthem, we are on much shakier ground.  That was the point of the earlier\narticle.  Human brains are infested with sin, and they can only be trusted\nin very limited circumstances.\n\n\n\nBut how far does that get you?  Once God's revelation stops, and your own\nreasoning begins, possibility for error appears.\n\nFor example, let's suppose that our modern Bible translations include a\nperfect rendering of Jesus words at the Last Supper, and that Jesus said,\nexactly, "This is my body."\n\nWe'll presume that what he said was totally without error and absolutely\ntrue.  What can we be certain of?  Not much.\n\nAt the moment he stops speaking, and people start interpreting, the\npossibility of error appears.  Did he mean that literally or not?  We do\nnot have any record that he elaborated on the words.  Was he thinking of\nTran- or Con- substatiation?   He didn't say.  We interpret this passage\nusing our brains; we think and reason and draw conclusions.  But we know\nthat our brains are not perfect: our thinking often leads us wrong.  (This\nis something that most of us have direct experience of.  8-)\n\nWhy should anyone believe that his reasoning -- which he knows to be\nfallible -- can lead him to perfect conclusions?\n\nSo, given the assumptions in this example, what we can be certain of is\nthat Jesus said "This is my body."  Beyond that, once we start making up\ndoctrines and using our brains to reason about what Christ revealed, we\nget into trouble.\n\nUnless you are infallible, there are very few things you can be certain\nof.  To the extent that doctrines rely on fallible human thinking, they\ncannot be certain.\n\n\n\nThat is the problem of seeming arrogant.  The non-Christians around us know\nthat human beings make mistakes, just as surely as we know it.  They do not\nbelieve we are infallible, any more than we do.\n\nWhen Christians speak as if they believe their own reasoning can never lead\nthem astray -- when we implicitly claim that we are infallible -- the non-\nChristians around us rarely believe that implicit claim.  Witnessing is\nhardly going to work when the person you are talking to believes that you\nare either too foolish to recognise your own limits, or intentionally trying\nto cover them up.\n\nI think it would be far better to say what things we are certain of and what\nthings we are only "very confident" of.  For example, we might say that we\nknow our sin, for recognising sin is something we directly experience.  But\nother things, whether based on reasoning from Scripture or extra-Biblical\nthinking, should not be labled as infallible: we should say that we are\nvery confident of them, and be ready to explain our reasoning.\n\nBut, so far as I am aware, none of us is infallible -- speaking or acting\nas if our thinking is flawless is ridiculous.\n\n *\n\n`REXLEX' suggested that people read _He is There and He is Not Silent_, by\nFrancis Schaeffer.  I didn't think very highly of it, but I think that\nMr Schaeffer is grossly overrated by many Evangelical Christians.  Somebody\nelse might like it, though, so don't let my opinion stop you from reading it.\n\nIf someone is interested in my opinion, I'd suggest _On Certainty_, by\nLudwig Wittgenstein.

I'm interested if anyone out here can point me towards a review of the\nfollowing book in any scholarly Christian journal, whether it be\nconservative or liberal, Protestant or Catholic.\n\n_The_Lost_Years_of_Jesus_ (documentary evidence for Jesus' 17 year\njourney to the East), by Elizabeth Clare Prophet.  Supposedly this\nis a theory that was refuted in the past, and she has re-examined it.\n\nI thought this was just another novel book, but I saw it listed as\na text for a class in religious studies here.  Also, the endorsements seem\nto come from some credible sources, so I'm wondering if scholars have\nreviewed it (or anyone on the net, for that matter).
I read somewhere, I think in Morton Smith's _Jesus the Magician_, that\nold Lazarus wasn't dead, but going in the tomb was part of an initiation\nrite for a magi-cult, of which Jesus was also a part.   It appears that\na 3-day stay was normal.   I wonder .... ?
The last state church was in Massachusetts.  Sam Adams, the patriot-brewmaster,\nduring his tenure as governor after the Revolutionary War got it passed.\nI believe it was eliminated around 1820.

I disagree.  People marry each other.  When they commit fully to each\nother as life partners, they are married.  The ceremony may assist in\nemphasizing the depth of such a commitment, but is of itself nothing.\nGod knows our hearts.  He knows when two have committed themselves to\nbe one, he knows the fears and delusions we have that keep us from fully\ngiving ourselves to another.  The way I see it, you'd have to be living\ntogether in a marriage for somewhere between 10 and 100 years before anyone\nknew if a marriage really existed, but God knows.  I don't think God keeps\na scorebook.
Hmmm.  Here's food for thought:  " ...but rather be in fear of him\nwho can destroy both soul and body in gehenna."  Math 10:28
The ONLY unity I've found which is true is when all parties involved are\ndisciples.  I came out of a church in which even the different\ncongregations were always competing and arguing about which one was\nbetter and who had the better messages (while none of them put anything\ninto practice from those messages).  Since becoming a disciple, I've\nfound that when I travel to another church in the same movement, they\nare just as accepting there as any other.  We had a retreat back in\nJanuary when some of the congregation from Louisville, KY came up (this\nretreat was for college students) and it was as though I had known even\nthe people from Louisville for years (and I had only become a disciple\nthe previous April and had never been to the church in Kentucky).  One\nof the keys to unity is unselfish love and self-sacrifice.  That is only\none area in which disciples stand out from "Christians".  Also, another\npart of unity is a common depth of conviction.  I've also been a part of\nsome "Christian" campus fellowships who were focused on unity between\nchurches and saw that those churches had one thing involved:  a lack of\nconviction about everything they believed.  That was why they could be\nunified, they didn't care about the truth but delighted in getting along\ntogether.\n\nCreeds?  What need is there of creeds when the Bible stands firmly\nbetter?\n\n\nAccording to the Scriptures, splits and differences of opinion are going\nto be there.  As per a previous note, I mentioned that there are those\nwho teach falsely by many means.  There are also differences of opinion\nand belief.  However, Scripture states:  \n   In the following directives I have no praise for you, for your\nmeetings do more harm than good.  In the first place, I hear that when\nyou come together as a church, there re divisions among you, and to some\nextent I believe it.  No doubt there have to be differences among you to\nshow which of you have God's approval (1 Corinthians 11:17-19).\n\nHow will God show his approval?  By fruitfulness (see Acts 2:47), but\nbefore that, there are these qualities:\n   devotion to the apostles teaching\n   fellowship\n   communion\n   filling with awe for God\n   all having everything in common.\n   glad and sincere hearts\n   praising God\n   enjoying the favor of the people\nAll these are mentioned in Acts 2:42-47.  God also shows that those who\nhave these qualities are persecuted.  Look at Stephen, "a man full of\nfaith and of the Holy Spirit" (Acts 6:5) who was later stoned (Acts\n7:54-60).  \n\n\nOne can say that a church is the true church only if that church is\nperfect not only in the congregation but worldwide as a movement.  I\nhave yet to find that, but the closest one I've found is the Boston\nChurch of Christ movement, which constantly strives to have errors\npointed out and corrected.  It is also the only one I've seen which is\ntotally sold out to God.\n\nAs for cooperation, that can always occur.  Unity, on the other hand may\nnever occur.  As for those who think about only one church being the\n"true one", I remind them that Mark 9:38-41 states that there are\ndisciples who are not a part of the main group to begin with, but they\nwill not lose their reward.  As with the Boston movement, I've heard\nnumerous times this exact same thing, that there are disciples out there\nthat are not a part of the Boston movement but that does not make them\nany less disciples.  Of course, few people admit that they've ever run\ninto someone who has the qualities of a disciple outside the movement.\nI know I haven't.\n\nI must warn that this sounds cliquey to me.  A clique is a group which\nruns around together to some extent exclusively.  This causes problems\nin fellowship and causes divisions.  I would not say at all that this is\nsomething "correct" for a church/group to do for any reason.  In one of\nthe churches I attended, for example, there was an internal clique of\npeople who were on the 14 different groups/committees/organizational\nheads of the congregation.  They rarely talked to anyone else outside of\nthe committees and seldom were voted out of office without another\noffice being "opened up" so that they would have to step right back in.\nTheir degree of exclusion was such that when the new pastor came, he\nnearly had to wipe out everything and start from scratch (I wish he\nwould've since they still have no clue about what it means to be a\ndisciple).  Anyway, this rigidity in the clique is beginning to be\nbroken down, but is still there.  So, I must warn against such division\nwithin.  There's enough division without.
And yet, Jayne,  as we read the Gospels and in particular the topics that Jesus\nhimself spoke on, Hell figures in a large % of the time -certainly more than\nheaven itself.  Paul, as we learn in I Thess, taught new believers and new\nchurches eschatology and did not hesitate to teach hell and damnation.  Rev,\nchapter 20:11-15 is very specific and cannot be allegorized.  I think the word\n"throne" is used 45 times in Rev and that the unbelieving come to receive the\nassignment of the severity of judgement, for in John 3 we read that they are\nalready judged.  Rom 3 speaks that every mouth will be shut.  There is no\nrecourse, excuse or defense.\n\nYes I agree with you.  Life is often like a pendulum where it swings to\nextremes before stopping at "moderation."  I think we have seen the extreme of\nthe "hell fire & brimstone" preacher, but also we have seen the other extreme\nwhere hell not talked about at all for fear of offending someones\nsensibilities.\n\nI forget who founded the Word of Life Ministries, but I remember him telling a\nstory.  He was in a small town hardware store and some how a man got to the\npoint of telling him that he didn't believe in Satan or hell.  He believed\neverybody was going to heaven.  It was at this point that the man was asked to\npray to God that He would send his children to hell!  Of course the man\nwouldn't do it.  But the point was made.  Many people say they don't believe in\nhell but they are not willing to really place their faith in that it doesn't\nexist.  If this man had, he would of prayed the prayer because hell didn't\nexist and there would have been no fear in having his prayer answered.  And\nyet, they walk as if they believe they will never be sent there.\n\nI'd use a different illustration however.  I have to include myself in it. \nWhen I watch, say a Basketball (go Bulls!) game, and I see a blatant foul that\nisn't called, oi vey!.  What's with that ref that he didn't make that call. \nIt's unfair.  And just so in life, righteousness demands payment.  As the\nsurgeon takes knife in hand to cut the cancer away, so God cuts off that which\nis still of the old creation.  We must preach the Gospel in all its richness\nwhich includes the fact that if you reject The Way and The Truth and The Life,\nthen broad is the way to distruction.\n\n\nI think I would fall in there somewhere.  Actually it was both.  After all,\nrepentance isn't only a turning towards, but also a turning away from!\nNo, again, if Jesus used it in His ministry then I can surely see that we\nshould do it also.  In love, of course, but in truth most assuredly.  \n\nI have thought about writing something on this topic, but not now and here.  I\nwould say that there are some good reasons for its existence and its\neternality.\n\n1) God is Light.  Yes He is love, but His love has the boundary of Holiness.\n2) Dignity of Man.  Either a man is a robot or he is a responsible creature.\n   If responsible, then he is also accountable.\n3) The awfulness of sin.  Today we have a poor, poor concept of sin & God.\n4) Christ.  He was willing to die and go there Himself to offer an avenue to\n   the "whosoever will."
I've sent the article.

I have been following this thread on talk.religion,\nsoc.religion.christian.bible-study and here with interest.  I am amazed at\nthe different non-biblical argument those who oppose the Sabbath present. \n\nOne question comes to mind, especially since my last one was not answered\nfrom Scripture.  Maybe clh may wish to provide the first response.\n\nThere is a lot of talk about the Sabbath of the TC being ceremonial. \nAnswer this:\n\nSince the TC commandments is one law with ten parts on what biblical\nbasis have you decided that only the Sabbath portion is ceremonial?\nOR You say that the seventh-day is the Sabbath but not applicable to\nGentile Christians.  Does that mean the Sabbath commandment has been\nannulled?  References please.\n\nIf God did not intend His requirements on the Jews to be applicable to\nGentile Christians why did He make it plain that the Gentiles were now\ngrafted into the commonwealth of Israel?\n\nDarius

Sorry for taking this off of Sharon's resp, but I'd also like to add\nsome more verses to that and perhaps answer the second Q.\n\nVerses:\n   1 Corinthians 6:9-10\n   Colossians 3:5-10\n\nAs for knowing when, that's a bit tricky.  People normally have\nconsciences which warn them about it.  However, as in my case, a\nconscience can be hardened by sin's deceitfulness (Hebrews 3:12:13) so\nthat the person has no idea (or doesn't care about it) that they are\nsinning.  Of course, there are those sins which we do when we don't know\nthat they're sinful to begin with.  Those take searching and examining\nof Scripture to find out that they are sinful and then repent and\nchange.  The best question to ask in every circumstance to judge sinful\npossibilities is:  "Would Jesus wholeheartedly do this at this point in\ntime?"  I know, it sounds like a cop-out, but it truly is a stifling\nquestion.\n\nJoe Fisher
however, the word "pa^ques" in french _is_ the word for easter.  ask\nany francophone, whether from quebec or from paris.  besides, haven't\nyou heard of the phrase "the paschal lamb" (meaning jesus)?\n\nsorry to nitpick on the more trivial part of this thread....
Note: I am cross-posting (actually, emailing) this to \nbit.listserv.catholic while main posting goes to \nsoc.religion.christian.\n\n[Quotations omitted.  This is in response to a question about\nthe Immaculate Conception.  I explained it, but left justification\nup to our Catholic readers.  --clh]\n\nThere is no direct reference in the Holy Scripture except for the\nmention of Mary's _blessedness_/full of grace in the "Annunciation" by\nAngel Gabriel in Luke 1:26-28\n\n And in the 6th month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto\n a city of Galilee, named Nazareth.  To a virgin espoused to a\n man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin's\n name was Mary.  And the angel came unto her and said, _"Hail,\n thou that art highly favoured, the Lord is with thee: blessed\n art thou among women."_\n\nNow, now, hold that line of thought - "the Lord is with Mary &\nblessed art thou among women" - while you read on....\n\nIn the book, "First Lady of the World, A Popular History of\nDevotion to Mary" by Peter Lappin:\n\nThe _Immaculate Conception_ matter is really far more complicated\nthan the _Assumption_.  This arose in 430 AD.  It is quite possible\nthat the feast of _Mary's Conception_ under the title "The Conception\nof Saint Anne", originally commemorated the _physical miracle_ of\na woman _beyond the age_ of child bearing, conceiving a daughter,\njust as Elizabeth had conceived John the Baptist.  A transfer in\nemphasis from the physical miracle wrought in Anne to the miracle\nof grace wrought by God in the soul of Mary was _logical_.  Mary\nis the incorruptible timber "out of which was hewn the _tabernacle_\nof Christ's sinless body"; she is "God's Eden, in whom there is\nno tree of knowledge, and no serpent that harms."  Her perfect\nbeauty and spotlessness find their exemplar in Christ, her\npurity in that of the Father.  At the time of the Council of Ephesus,\nshe was hailed as "innocent, without blemish, immaculate, inviolate,\nspotless, holy in soul and body, who was blessed as a lily from\namong thorns, unlearned in the evil ways of Eve".\n...\nAt the end of the thirteenth century, an Irish Franciscan,\nJohn Duns Scotus (1266-1308),...God maintained that it was a \ngreater thing for Him to preserve His (the Son) mother from all\nsin _than to use His power to clease her from it later_.\n...\n\nNow let's go to the discussion of baptism and original sin.\nFrom "Pocket Catholic Cathechism" by John A. Hardon:\n\nBaptism -\nConcupiscence Remains after Baptism.\nConcupiscence or the tendency to sin remains in the baptized\nbut since it is left to provide trial, it has no power to\ninjure those who do not consent and who by the grace of\nChrist Jesus, manfully resist (Canon 5).\n\nOriginal gifts of Adam and Eve before their fall:\nIn the light of the foregoing, we see that our first\nparents were originally gifted three times over:\n-They had the natural gifts of human beings especially the\n power to think and to choose freely.\n-The had the _preternatural_ gifts of bodily immortality\n and of integrity, or the internal power to control desires.\n-They had the _supernatural_ gifts of sanctifying grace,\n the virtues of faith, hope, and charity and the corresponding\n title to enter heaven.\nBy their disobedience, they lost the _supernatural and\npreternatural_ gifts entirely, and were weakened (without\nlosing) their natural capacity to reason and to choose\nfreely.\n\nBaptism restores the _supernatural_ life lost by Adam's\nsin.  It _does not_ restore the _preternatural_ gifts\nbut gifts as a title to a glorified restoration of our\nbodies on the last day...\n\nGoing back to _Immaculate Conception_\n(I am not sure if this interpretation is in any other\nbooks but it may be another contribution to the 'puzzle'):\n\nGiven the miracle of St. Anne bearing a child at a\nnon-childbearing age, AND Christ was not yet born \nAND _there was no baptism yet_ on Mary's birth but\nSTILL, the Angel Gabriel's greetings was:\n"Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with you.\nBlessed art thou amongst women".\n\nEven Mary was confused about this greeting.\n\nMary could very well have possessed all of the\n_treefold original gifts above_ given to our first\nparents (Adam and Eve before their sin):\n    Hail Mary (Example of praise given by the Angel Gabriel)\n    Full of grace (natural, preternatural, supernatural)\n    The Lord is with you (At those times, God would\n                definitely want to be with those He\n                has made _blessed_)\n    Blessed art thou amongst women (that says it all)\n\nAt the conception, God made Mary _full of grace\nand blessed_ as the 'tabernacle' for the coming body\nof Christ and so,\n\nImmaculate Conception of Mary is true and Mary still\nhas maintained her Immaculate Heart.
[DISCLAIMER: Throughout this post, there are statements and questions which\ncould easily be interpreted as being sarcastic.  They are not.  I have written\nthis reply in the most even-handed manner that I can, with no emotions boiling\nto the surface as it was written.  Please accept this as a serious attempt to\nfoster dialog and rest assurred that I make every attempt to make fun of no\none, except myself ;-)]\n\n\n\n[...]\n\n\n	Hmmm.  There are other animals on this planet with advanced\n	mental facilities which have not developed "religion" as a\n	satisfactory explaination for the unexplained.  Why is this so?\n\n	Further, it appears that only humans have a "need" to explain the\n	unexplained.  Why is this so?  The other animals on this planet,\n	including those with advanced mental facilities, seem perfectly\n	content in their ignorance.\n\n	I'd like to point out that your presuppositions scream out at me\n	from your unsupported statement.  They are: 1) humans are animal\n	*only*; 2) religion exists as a crutch so that the unexplained need\n	not be researched; 3) religion was "made up" by humans to address a\n	perceived need; 4) the biological aspect of humans is deified (that\n	is, all aspects of human life can be categorized in a hierarchical\n	structure with biology at the apex).\n\n	Needless to say, I disagree with your strong opinion #1 and the\n	underlying presuppositions.\n\n\n	I disagree that Christianity is "an infectious cult".  It has\n	certainly shown itself to be persistent as a belief system, in\n	spite of various persecutions throughout the past two millenia.\n	That it continues to persevere does not demonstrate that it is\n	"infectious" in a derrogatory sense; it may be that it provides\n	a workable system for its adherents (and I would argue that this\n	is the case).\n\n	I disagree that Christianity is "a safety blanket" which supplants\n	hope and purpose.  Rather, it points an individual to the one\n	Source of hope and purpose.  There is nothing hidden about a\n	Christian's source for hope and purpose.  Of what usefulness to\n	you is the distinction between internally motivated hope and purpose\n	and externally given hope and purpose?  Is the (apparent) loss of\n	control over one's own life the problem or is it something else?\n\n	Finally, one does not appropriate "eternal happiness" by following\n	Christian moral standards.  Indeed, the sole reason for the existance\n	of Christianity is *because* standards are inadequate to save people\n	from their imperfections.  Moral standards are merely guides to the\n	Christian; the real power to moral living is given to the Christian\n	in the Person of God's Spirit.\n\n	Heaven is one of two final states that\n	Christian doctrine postulates.  However, Christians are generally\n	not motivated to live according to Christian moral standards by this\n	promised future reward; rather, they are motivated by the perceived\n	benefits to them in the here-and-now.\n\n\n	Many Christian organizations are concerned with evangelism as a\n	priority, and rightly so (for it was Jesus Himself who gave this\n	as a priority for His followers).  However, it is not the penultimate\n	priority as evangelism is normally understood (i.e. preach the word,\n	convert at nearly any cost, repeat with new convert ad infinitum).\n	Rather, such evangelism is generally best done through respecting\n	the opinions of others while *demonstrating* the very real benefits\n	of a Christian lifestyle.  This demonstration should be so powerful\n	that it compels the non-Christian to seek out the Christian to ask\n	"Why?"  Needless to say, such a demonstration is not easily accom-\n	plished (it takes a radical committment to the person of Jesus), it\n	does not happen quickly (so perseverance on the part of the Christian\n	is required), and it cannot occur where no personal bonds of\n	friendship exist (it is ineffective with strangers who cannot\n	evaluate the demonstration over time, and it is easy to alienate or\n	harm others if the sole purpose of being a "friend" is to gain a\n	conversion).\n\n	As a long-time Christian (nearly 20 years), I view with some skep-\n	ticism *all* evangelism programs which incorporate a "hurry-up"\n	attitude.  Pressured conversions may ultimately be worse than no\n	conversion at all (because the pressured convert realizes s/he was\n	coerced and disavows Christianity when they would have been open\n	to it in the future had they not been taken advantage of now).\n	The Bible states that it is the very Spirit of God which brings\n	conviction of wrong-doing to people.  I am content to do my part\n	(witness) and let the Spirit do the rest.\n\n\n	We are far more than animals.  We sleep, eat, reproduce, and die\n	just as other animals do - true.  But, we are also capable of more\n	than this.  If your personal vision of humanity (or of yourself) is\n	so limited, I can only hope and pray ;-) that you will someday find\n	a more expansive view.\n\n	(For reflection, what animals have the wide variety of performing\n	arts that humans do?  How is it that humans can learn the language\n	of other humans (or animals) but that other animals cannot do so?\n	How is it that humans can organize themselves in various social\n	structures whereas other animals have only one structure?)\n\n\n	Blatant assertion.  Christianity is not physically addictive.\n	Christianity is not psychologically addictive.  Christianity is not\n	a *thing* which one snorts/ingests/shoots-up; it is a relationship\n	with a living being.  You might as validly characterize any close-\n	knit relationship with this appelation.\n\n\n	There are "Jesus freaks" who let the emotional aspects of worship\n	and Christian living gain (and retain) the upper hand.  Even so,\n	this does not by itself invalidate the foundation from which these\n	things flow.\n\n\n	Guilty by association?  That "christianity" which forces itself\n	upon another is not Christianity at all.\n\n\n	You appear to have an amazing certainty about what really happened\n	2000 years ago.  How did you come by it?\n\n	I cannot accept your conclusion that Jesus' influence was a sole\n	result of the Roman sack of Jerusalem in 70AD.  He was 30+ years\n	gone by this time.  It strains the bounds of credulity to assert\n	that nothing about Jesus' life was noteworthy _until_ the sack.\n\n\n	Christianity is having a relationship with Jesus Christ Himself.\n	What do you know of Him?

I'd like to share my thoughts on this topic of "arrogance of\nChristians" and look forward to any responses.  In my\nencounters with Christians, I find myself dismayed by their\nbelief that their faith is total truth.  According to them,\ntheir beliefs come from the Bible and the bible is the word of\nGod and God is truth - thus they know the truth.  This stance\nmakes it difficult to discuss other faiths with them and my own\nhesitations about Christianity because they see no other way.\nTheir way is the 'truth.'\n\nBut I see their faith arising from a willful choice to believe\na particular way.  That choice is part faith and part reason,\nbut it seems to me a choice.\n\nMy discussions with some Christians remind me of schoolyard\ndiscussions when I was in grade school:\n\nA kid would say, "All policemen are jerks!"  I'd ask, "How do\nyou know?"  "Because my daddy told me so!"  "How do you know\nyou're daddy is right?"  "He says he's always right!"\n\nWell the argument usually stops right there.  In the end,\naren't we all just kids, groping for the truth?  If so, do we have\nthe authority to declare all other beliefs besides our own as\nfalse?\n\n-------------\n\nThis is only my third time browsing through this newsgroup.  I\napologize if I'm covering tired old ground.  Some of the\ndiscussions on this topic have piqued my interest and I welcome\nany comments.\n\n-- \n\n[I'm sort of mystified about how a Christian might respond to this.  I\ncan understand criticisms of Christianity that say there's not enough\nevidence to believe it, or that there's just as good evidence for\nother religions.  I don't agree, but clearly there are plenty of\nintelligent people who don't find the evidence convincing.  But that\ndoesn't seem to be your point.  Rather, you seem upset that people who\nbelieve Christianity is true also believe that things which contradict\nit are false.\n\nThis suggests a model of spiritual things that's rather different than\nthe Christian one.  It sounds more like an existentialist view, where\npeople choose what value to follow, but there's no actual independent\nspiritual reality, and so no way to say that a specific choice is in\nsome unique sense right.  This sort of model -- with modifications of\none sort or another -- may be appropriate for some religions.  But\nChristianity is in its essense a "historical" religion.  That is, it's\nbased on the concept that there are actual spiritual entities out\nthere, that one of them has intervened in history in specific ways,\nand that we see evidence of that in history.  In the "mundane" world,\nwe are not free to choose how things work.  When we drop something, it\nfalls (aside from well-defined situations where it doesn't).  The\nChristian concept is that spiritual matters, there is also an actual\nexternal reality.  I hope we're all honest enough not to claim that we\nhave perfect understanding.  But while we may not think we know\neverything, we are confident that we know some things.  And that\nimplies that we think things that contradict them are false.  I don't\nsee how else we could proceed.\n\nThis needn't result in arrogance.  I'm certainly interested in talking\nwith people of other religions.  They may have things to teach me, and\neven if they don't, I respect them as fellow human beings.  But it's\ngot to be possible to respect people and also think that on some\nmatters they are wrong.  Maybe even disasterously wrong.
> If you know the Latin, one really beautiful way to hear the\n > Passion is its being chanted by three deacons: the Narrator\n > chants in the middle baritone range, Jesus chants in the bass,\n > and others directly quoted are handled by a high tenor.\n\nThis is done in English (same music as the traditional Latin) in\nmany Anglican parishes. I should expect that many RCC parishes would\ndo likewise.  The ST MATTHEW PASSION and ST JOHN PASSION of J S Bach\nare direct offshoots of this tradition
the classic references in this area are Jacques Ellul for a\nliberal/evangelical perspective and Os Guiness for a straight\nevangelical view.  If you want to look at non-christian sources\ntry Alvin Toffler as the perennial optimist.  His views while\nblatently non christian explore where technology may be going.\n\n\nThis is regardless of technology.  Be careful to separate the issues of\nrelated to speed and dispersion of technology (how far the letter\nwent and how quickly it got there) and the message being passed in the\ntechnology (something that seems to be totally wrong.)\n\n\nWhen lecturing in this area I challenge my (non-christan/atheistic) class\nabout the impact technology has on life, quality of life and the rights\nthat they consider important.  Depending on how you work out your\nfaith will determine your response to the use of technology.  For example\nfriends of mine are considering IVF due to a life threatening situation the\nwife is going through; when it is over they will have the baby. (God\nwilling).  In this case the technology is available and my friends have to\ndecide what to do.  In all cases though you must decide if the technology\nis against God's revealed word.\n\nRegards\n David

A question for you - can you give me the name of an organization or a\nphilosophy or a political movement, etc., which has never had anything\nevil done in its name?  You're missing a central teaching of Christianity -\nman is inherently sinful.  We are saved through faith by grace.  Knowing\nthat, believing that, does not make us without sin.  Furthermore, not all\nwho consider themselves "christians" are (even those who manage to head\ntheir own "churches").  "Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will\nenter the kingdom of heaven, but only he who does the will of my Father who\nis in heaven." - Matt. 7:21.\n\n\nAgain, what historical documents do you trust?  Do you think Hannibal\ncrossed the Alps?  How do you know?  How do you know for sure?  What\nhistorical documents have stood the scrutiny and the attempts to dis-\ncredit it as well as the Bible has?\n\n\nWell, it's really a shame you feel this way.  No one can browbeat you\ninto believing, and those who try will probably only succeed in driving\nyou further away.  You need to ask yourself some difficult questions:\n1) is there an afterlife, and if so, does man require salvation to attain\nit.  If the answer is yes, the next question is 2) how does man attain this\nsalvation - can he do it on his own as the eastern religions and certain\nmodern offshoots like the "new age movement" teach or does he require God's\nhelp?  3) If the latter, in what form does - indeed, in what form can such\nhelp come?  Needless to say, this discussion could take a lifetime, and for\nsome people it did comprise their life's writings, so I am hardly in a\nposition to offer the answers here - merely pointers to what to ask.  Few,\nof us manage to have an unshaken faith our entire lives (certainly not me).\nThe spritual life is a difficult journey (if you've never read "A Pilgrim's\nProgress," I highly recommend this greatest allegory of the english language).\n\n\nNow I see by your close that one possible source of trouble for you may be a\nconflict between your politcal beliefs and your religious upbringing.  You\nwrote that "I (in my own faith) accept and live my life by many if not most\nof the teachings of christ".  Well, Christ referred to God as "My Father",\nnot "My Mother", and while the "maleness" of God is not the same as the\nmaleness of those of us humans who possess a Y chromosome, it does not\nhonor God to refer to Him as female purely to be trendy, non-discriminatory,\nor politically correct.  This in no way disparages women (nor is it my intent\nto do so by my use of the male pronoun to refer to both men and women - \nenglish just does not have a decent neuter set of pronouns).  After all, God\nchose a woman as his only human partner in bringing Christ into the human\npopulation.\n\nWell, I'm not about to launch into a detailed discussion of\nthe role of women in Christianity at 1am with only 6 hours of sleep in the\nlast 63, and for that reason I also apologize for any shortcomings in this\narticle.  I just happened across yours and felt moved to reply.  I hope I\nmay have given you, and anyone else who finds himself in a similar frame of\nmind, something to contemplate.
I've heard it said that the accounts we have of Christs life and\nministry in the Gospels were actually written many years after the event.\n(About 40 years or so). Is this correct?? If so, why the big time delay??\nI know all scripture is inspired of God, so the time of writing is I suppose\nun-important, but I still can't help be curious!\n\n---------------------------------------------------\nIvan Thomas Barr \n\nContact me at u9126619@athmail1.causeway.qub.ac.uk\n\n[The Gospels aren't dated, so we can only guess.  Luke's prolog is\nabout the only thing we have from the author describing his process.\nThe prolog sounds like Luke is from the next generation, and had to do\nsome investigating.  There are traditions passed down verbally that\nsay a few things about the composition of the Gospels.  There are\ndebates about how reliable these traditions are.  They certainly don't\nhave the status of Scripture, yet scholars tend to take some of them\nseriously.  One suggests that Mark was based on Peter's sermons, and\nwas written to preserve them when Peter had died or way about to die.\nOne tradition about Matthew suggests that a collection of Jesus words\nmay have been made earlier than the current Gospels.  \n\nIn the ancient world, it was much more common to rely on verbal\ntransmission of information.  I think many people would have preferred\nto hear about Jesus directly from someone who had known him, and maybe\neven from someone who studied directly under such a person, rather\nthan from a book.  Thus I suspect that the Gospels are largely from a\nperiod when these people were beginning to die.  Scholars generally do\nthink there was some written material earlier, which was probably used\nas sources for the existing Gospels.\n\nEstablishing the dates is a complex and technical business.  I have to\nconfess that I'm not sure how much reliance I'd put on the methods\nused.  But it's common to think that Mark was written first, around 64\nAD., and that all of the Gospels were written by the end of the\nCentury.  A few people vary this by a decade or so one way or the\nother.
Now this is getting interesting!\n\nI was raised Roman Catholic before becoming an atheist, so I have stated\nthis Creed you quote nearly every Sunday until I was about 18.  For some\nreason, I always took the 'resurrection' in this statement to mean the\nresurrection of the soul, but I guess resurrection does strictly mean\nthe raising of the physical body.  I have some questions on this point:\n\n1.  I always thought that Christians believe the descent into hell was \npretty much immediate, and that there are people burning in hell right\nnow.  You seem to be implying that it will not occur until after the\n"great judgement" (which I read as meaning the proverbial Judgment Day).\nI was always a little confused on this point, even when I was with the\nchurch -- maybe someone can clear it up for me.  Where will my "soul"\n(which, by the way, I don't believe in) exist until that time?\n\n2.  Will the new body I will have be created out of the same atoms \nthat my body now is made of, or will it be built from scratch?  My\nphysical body now is susceptible to aging, etc. -- so I guess my\nnew body will have to be radically different in order to be immortal\nso it can be tortured for all eternity?\n\n3.  Since I will have a physical body, I assume it will need a physical\nplace to exist in -- where is this hell?  In the center of the earth?\nDo you think we could find it if we dig?\n\nMark Schnitzius\nschnitzi@eola.cs.ucf.edu\nUniv. of Central Florida\n\n[There is not complete agreement on the details of the afterlife.  I\nthink the most common view is that final disposition does not occur\nuntil a final judgement, which is still in the future.  In the\nmeantime, some believe that people "sleep" until the final\nresurrection (or because God is above time, pass directly from death\nto the future time when the resurrection occurs), while others believe\nthat souls have a disembodied, pre-resurrection existence until then.\nThere are probably other alternatives that I'm omitting.\n\nThe new body is generally conceived of being implemented in a\ndifferent "technology" than the current one, one which is not mortal.\n(Paul talks about the mortal being raised to immortality, and Jesus'\nresurrected body -- which is the first example -- clearly was not\nsubject to the same kind of limitations as ours.)  It is assumed that\nthere are enough similarities that people will recognize each other,\nbut I don't think most people claim to know the details.  I don't\nthink I'd say it's the same atoms.  I'd assume there would be some\nanalog of a physical place, but I wouldn't expect to find it under the\nearth or up in the sky.  I'd suspect that it's in another dimension,\noutside this physical world, or whatever.  But again, we have little\nin the way of details.
I apologize to the moderator, but the first quote was deleted and I\nwould like to respond to both.\n\nAs for the "goal we can never achieve", the reward comes from the\ntrying.  Paul makes a clear claim that we are to continue straining for\nthe prize over in Philippians 3:10-16.  Only by not living out the\ncommands do we stagnate and become lukewarm, to be spit out by Jesus.\nAs it says in 1 John 5:3:  "This is love for God:  to obey his comands."\nThat obedience is our straining to achieve for God.  Of course, this\nrequires work on our part.\n\nAs for the quote in James, Satan doesn't care what we believe.  What\nmatters is the results of our belief (works).  If one truly has faith in\nwhat one believes, one will either act on that faith or be lying to\noneself about believing in the first place.  \n\nStan, as for your first line, you have a very good point.  Obedience by\nobligation (grudgery) is not what God desires.  Instead, look at how\nmany times the Bible talks about being joyous in all situations and when\ndoing God's work.  Being begrudged by the work has no value.  Also, we\nshould do the work necessary whenever we can, not just when we feel\nJesus' presence.  Feelings can deceive us.  However, as Paul states to\nTimothy in 2 Timothy 4:2:  "Preach the Word; be prepared in season and\nout of season; correct, rebuke and encourage--with great patience and\ncareful instruction."  Also, remember that Paul tells Timothy in 1\nTimothy 4:16:  "Watch your life and doctrine closely.  Persevere in\nthem, because if you do, you will save both yourself and your hearers."\nSo, in order to do the work necessary, we need to be sure that we are\ncorrect first.  Remember Jesus' warning in Matthew 7:3-5 not to be\nhypocritical about what we do.  The best way to accomplish this is to be\na disciple completely in both thought and deed.
I will answer this as I find time.\n\n\nNotice what I said about this book.  I called it "Easy reading."  The reason I\ndropped philosphy as my major was because I ran into too many pharisaical\nSimon's.  I don't know how many walking encyclopedia's I ran across in\nphilosphy classes.  The problem isn't in knowing sooooo much more than your\naverage lay person, the problem comes when you become puffed up about it. \nSchaeffer is just fine for the average lay person.  That was who he was\nwritting to.  I suppose that you would have criticised John that his gospel was\nto simple.  I've talked with Schaeffer one on one.  I've been in lectures with\nthe man when he was being drilled by philosphy students and prof's from secular\nas well as Christian universities. (ND alone would fill both those catagories) \nHis answers were enough that the prof's themselves often were taken back and\ncaused to re-think what their question was.  I saw this time and time again at\ndifferent open forums.  So yes, Schaeffers books are by in large, well,\nsimplistic.  It certainly isn't grad level reading.  But we must get off our\nhigh horses when it comes to recommended reading.  Do you seriously think most\npeople would get through the first chapter of Wittgenstein?  I may have more to\nsay about this secular scientist at another time.\n\nAlso, one must finally get beyond the doubt caused by *insistent*\ninquisitiveness.  One cannot live his life constantly from a cartisian doubt\nbase.  \n\nLook, the Christian wholeheartedly supports genuine rationality.  But we must\nadd a qualification to give this balance.  Christianity is second to none in\nkeeping reason in its place.  We never know the value of a thing until we know\nits limits.  Put unlimited value on something and in the end you will exhaust\nit of all value!\n\nTHis is why Xianity is thoroughly rational but not the least bit rationalistic.\n It also explains the curious fact that it is rationalism, and not Christian\nfaith, which leads to irrationality.  If we forget the limits of a thing, we\nfly in the face of reality and condem ourselves to learn the simple ironic\nlesson of life: \n\n"More without limits is less;  less with limits is more."  \n\nOr as I have so often stated it, freedom without form soon becomes form w/o\nfreedom.\n\nLet's put it another way.  The rationality of faith is implacably opposed to\nabsurdity but has no quarrel with mystery. Think about that.  It can tell the\ndifference between the two if you will let it.  Christianity's contention with\nrationalism is not that it has too much reason in it, but that it has very\nlittle else.  When a Christian comes to faith his understanding and his trust\ngo hand in hand, but as he continues in faith his trust may sometimes be called\nto go on by itself without his understanding.\n\nThis is where the principle of suspended judgment applies.  At such time if the\nChristian faith is to be itself and let God be God, it must suspend judgment\nand say, "Father I do not understand you but I trust you."  Now don't read all\nyour objections of me into that statement.  I wasn't saying I do not understand\nyou at all, but I trust you anyway." It means that "I do not understand You *in\nthis situation* but I do understand *why I trust You* anyway"  Therefore I can\ntrust that you understand even though I do not. The former is a mystery\nunrelieved by rationality and indistinguishable from absurdity.  The latter is\na statement of rationality of faith walking hand in hand with the mystery of\nFaith.  So.... the principle of suspended judgment is not irrational.  It is\nnot a leap of faith but a walk of faith.  As believers we cannot always know\nwhy, but we canalways know why we trust God who knows why and this makes all\nthe difference.\n\nNow, there is one obvious snag to all this and this is where I have parted\ncompany with philosophy- what is eminently reasonable in theory is a rather bit\nmore difficult in practice.  In practice the pressure of mystery acts on faith\nlike the insistent "whying" of a 3 year old.  It isn't just that we would like\nto know what we do not know but that we feel we *must* know what we cannot\nknow.  The one produces frustration because curiosity is denied; the other\nleads to genuine anguish.  More specifically the poorer our understanding is in\ncoming to faith the more necessary it will be to understand everything after\ncoming to faith.  If we do not know why we trust God, then we will always need\nto know exactly what God is doing in order to trust him.  Failing to grasp\nthat, we may not be able to trust him, for anything we do not understand may\ncount decisevely against what we are able to trust.  \n\nIf, on the other hand, we do know why we trust God, we will be able to trust\nhim in situations where we do not understand what He is doing. (Too many Xian\nleaders teach as if the Christian had a window in the back of his head which\nallows for understanding at every foot fall)  For what God is doing may be\nambiguous, but it will not be inherently contradictory!  It may be mystery to\nus, but mystery is only inscrutable; what would be insufferable is absurdity.\nAnd that my friend, was the conclusion of Nietzche both in theory and in\npractice.
believeing blindly or not. I'm not sure how blindness comes into it. I do > not\ndeny reason, indeed I insist upon it, but reason only draws conclusions > from\nevidence. If you decide in advance that your reason will act only on > the\nevidence of the five physical senses, then you cut reason off from any >\npossibility of reaching a conclusion outside the physical sphere (beyond the >\nrather provocative, if inconclusive, conclusion that the physical sphere > is\nnot self explanatory). \n\nSo your are saying to rely on our feelings and experiences (since\nthis is the only other source of information left to us).\nHow can you then convince somebody that your "feelings and experiences"\nare the correct ones then if you can't show somebody visible and\nmeasurable effects?  If my experiences say that "there exists no god"\nand yours says there does, where does that leave us?  Since we are only\ngoing on experiences, then both of us are correct within our own personal\nrealities.\n\nFurthermore, the trouble with "feelings and experiences" is that they\ncan lead you astray, as the tragic outcome of Waco illustrates.  I\nam sure that many of Koresh's followers really believed in him but\nI think that you and I will agree that they were being misled.\n\nFinally, how on earth do you come to the conclusion that the physical\nsphere is not self-explanatory when you only rely on the five senses?\n\n\nYou must be using a definition of "evidence" that I am not familiar with.\nTo me, evidence is something you can show others -unambiguously- that\nwhat you are saying is true.\n\nHowever, I agree with you that belief in a diety is a matter of faith.\nIt is not something you can share around - others must experience it\nindependantly.  Unfortunately, as I have explained above, this puts\nbelief down to a matter of experience.  My impression is that Christians\ndo not have the monopoly on reason, evidence and faith as far as any of\nthese things can go.\n\n\nAt the risk of repeating my argument : As I have explained previously, \nthe trouble is that Moslems, Buddhists, Jews, etc will ALL say that THEY\nclaim, with good reason, to be a valid system, possessed of the best\nevidence, for explaining Gods revelations to man (for Buddhists it\nshould read "for explaining the non-existence of God").  So not only\nmust you "prove" your own case, you have to "disprove" theirs.\n\n(alt.messianic is a good place to see people strong in the belief\nof their own faiths ... and with their own good reasons)\n\n\nI know that ALL people can use reason ... I never claimed that they don't.\nI just wish to make sure that their arguments are well-founded.  It goes\nwithout saying that if I make a blunder that I expect people to correct\nme.  Once we have all gone through this process of removing the \nnon-essential and contradictory bits, we should (hopefully) have made\nsome progress towards the truth.
Koberg,\n\n	Just a couple of minor corrections here...\n\n	1)  The Churches of Christ do not usually believe in speaking in\ntongues, in fact many of them are known for being strongly opposed to\nPentecostal teaching.  You are probably thinking of Church of God in\nChrist, the largest African-American Pentecostal denomination.\n\n	2)  I'm not sure what you mean by "signifying believers"  but it\nshould be pointed out that the Assemblies of God does not now, nor has it\never, held that speaking in tongues is the sign that one is a Christian. \nThe doctrine that traditional Pentecostals (including the A/G) maintain is\nthat speaking in tongues is the sign of a second experience after becoming\na Christian in which one is "Baptized in the Holy Spirit"  That may be\nwhat you were referring to, but I point this out because Pentecostals are\nfrequently labeled as believing that you have to speak in tongues in order\nto be a Christian.  Such a position is only held by some groups and not the\nmajority of Pentecostals.   Many Pentecostals will quote the passage in\nMark 16 about "these signs following them that believe" but they generally\ndo not interpret this as meaning if you don't pactice the signs you aren't\n"saved".\n\n	3)  I know it's hard to summarize the beliefs of a movement that\nhas such diversity, but I think you've made some pretty big\ngeneralizations here.  Do "Neo-Pentecostals" only believe in tongues as a\nsign and tongues as prayer but NOT tongues as revelatory with a message? \nI've never heard of that before.  In fact I would have characterized them\nas believing the same as Pentecostals except less likely to see tongues as\na sign of Spirit Baptism.  Also, while neo-Pentecostals may not be\ninclined to speak in tongues in the non-Pentecostal churches they attend,\nthey do have their own meetings and, in many cases, a whole church will be\ncharismatic.
=  \n= : [ The discussion begins: why does the universe exist at all?  ]\n=  \n= : One of the Laws of Nature, specifying cause and effect seems to dictate \n= : (at least to this layman's mind) there must be a causal event.  No\n= : reasonable alternative exists.\n= \n= I would argue that causality is actually a property of spacetime; \n= causes precede their effects. \n\nAnd I must concede here.  Cause *before* effect, implies time, time is part\nof spacetime.  Hense, the argument would be valid.  I could return and say \nthat this does not infer the cause and effect relationship being *unique*\nto *this* spacetime, but I won't 8^), because the point is moot.  Doesn't\naddress why (which Petri Pikho addresses below).  \n\nI also concede that I was doubly remiss, as I asserted "No reasonable\nalternative exists", an entirely subjective statement on my part (and one\nthat could  be invalidated, given time and further discovery by the\nscientist).  I also understand that a proving a theory does not necessarily\nspecify that "this is how it happened", but proposes a likely description of\nthe phenomena in question.  Am I mistaken with this understanding?\n\n= But if you claim that there must be\n= an answer to "how" did the universe (our spacetime)  emerge from \n= "nothing", science has some good candidates for an answer.\n\nAll of which require something we Christians readily admit to: ``Faith''.\n\nThe fact that there are several candidates belies that *none* are conclusive.  \nWith out conclusive evidence, we are left with faith.\n\nIt could even be argued that one of these hypotheses may one day be proven (as\nbest as a non-repeatable event can be "proven").  But I ask, what holds  \nsomeone *today* to the belief that any or all of them are correct, except by \nfaith?\n\n[ a couple of paragraphs deleted.  Summary: we ask "Why does the\nuniverse exist" ]\n\n= I think this question should actually be split into two parts, namely\n= \n= 1) Why is there existence? Why anything exists?\n= \n= and\n= \n= 2) How did the universe emerge from nothing?\n= \n= It is clear science has nothing to say about the first question. However,\n= is it a meaningful question, after all?\n=\n= I would say it isn't. Consider the following:\n\nApparently it *is* for many persons.  Hence, we *have* religions.\n\n= The question "why anything exists" can be countered by\n= demanding answer to a question "why there is nothing in nothingness,\n= or in non-existence".  Actually, both questions turn out to be\n= devoid of meaning. Things that exist do, and things that don't exist\n= don't exist. Tautology at its best.\n\nCarefully examine the original question, and then the "counter-question". \nThe first asks "Why", while the second is a request for definition.  It \ndoesn't address why something does or does not exist, but asks to define \nthe lack of existence.  The second question is unanswerable indeed, for\nhow do we identify something as "nothing" (aren't they mutually exclusive\nterms)?.  How do we identify a state of non-existence (again, this is\nnearing the limits of this simple layman's ability to comprehend, and I\nwould appreciate an explanation). \n\nI might add, the worldview of "Things that exist do, and things that\ndon't...don't" is as grounded in the realm of the non-falsifiable,\nas does the theist's belief in God.  It is based on the assumption\nthat there is *not* a reason for being, something as ultimately\n(un)supportable as the position of there being a reason.  Its very\nfoundation exists in the same soil as that of one who claims there *is* a\nreason.\n\nWe come to this. Either "I am, therefore I am.", or "I am for a reason."\nIf the former is a satisfactory answer, then you are done, for you are\nsatisfied, and need not a doctor.  If the latter, your search is just\nbeginning.  \n\n= I seriously doubt God could have an answer to this question.\n\nTime will tell. 8^)\n\n= \n= Some Christians I have talked to have said that actually, God is\n= Himself the existence. However, I see several problems with this\n= answer. First, it inevitably leads to the conclusion that God is\n= actually _all_ existence, good and evil, devils and angels, us and\n= them. This is pantheism, not Christianity.\n\nAgreed.  It would lead me to question their definition of Christianity as\nwell.\n\n= Another answer is that God is the _source_ of all existence.\n= This sounds much better, but I am tempted to ask: Does God\n= Himself exist, then? If God is the source of His own existence,\n= it can only mean that He has, in terms of human time, always\n= existed. But this is not the same as the source of all existence.\n\nThis does not preclude His existence.  It only seeks to identify His\n*qualities* (implying He exists to *have* qualities, BTW).\n\n= The best answer I have heard is that human reasoning is incapable\n= of understanding such questions. Being an atheist myself, I do not\n= accept such answers, since I do not have any other methods.\n\nLike the theist, we come to a statement of faith, for this position assumes \nthat the evidence at hand is conclusive.  Note, I am not arguing against \nscientific endeavor, for science is useful for understanding the universe in\nwhich we exist. But I differ from the atheist in a matter of perspective.  I\nseek to understand what exists to understand and appreciate the art of the\nCreator.\n\nI also have discovered science is an inadequate tool to answer "why".   It\nappears that M. Pihko agrees (as we shall see).  But because a tool is\ninadequate to answer a question does not preclude the question.  Asserting\nthat 'why' is an invalid question does not provide an answer.  \n\n= : As far as I can tell, the very laws of nature demand a "why".  That isn't\n= : true of something outside of nature (i.e., *super*natural).\n= \n= This is not true. Science is a collection of models telling us "how",\n= not why, something happens. I cannot see any good reason why the "why"\n= questions would be bound only to natural things, assuming that the\n= supernatural domain exists. If supernatural beings exist, it is\n= as appropriate to ask why they do so as it is to ask why we exist.\n\nMy apologies.  I was using why as "why did this come to be".  Why did\npre-existence become existence.  Why did pre-spacetime become spacetime.\n\nBut we come to the admission that science fails to answer "Why?".  Because\nit can't be answered in the realm of modern science, does that make the\nquestion invalid?\n= : I don't believe *any*\n= : technology would be able to produce that necessary *spark* of life, despite\n= : having all of the parts available. Just my opinion.\n= \n= This opinion is also called vitalism; namely, that living systems are\n= somehow _fundamentally_ different from inanimate systems. Do Christians\n= in general adopt this position? What would happen when scientists announce\n= they have created primitive life (say, small bacteria) in a lab?\n\nI suppose we would do the same thing as when Galileo or Capernicus was \n*vindicated*  (before someone starts jumping up and down screaming\n"Inquisition!", note I said *vindicated*.  I certainly hope we've gotten\nbeyond the "shooting the messenger" stage).\n\nM. Pihko does present a good point though.  We may need to ask "What do I \nas an individual Christian base my faith on?"  Will it be shaken by the\nproduction of evidence that shatters our "sacred cows" or will we seek to\nunderstand if a new discovery truly disagrees with what God *said* (and\ncontinues to say) in his Word?\n\n"Why do I ask why?" (apologies to Budweiser and company 8^]).\n\nJason.
Jesus was born a Jew.  We have biblical accounts of\nboth his mother's ancestry and his father's, both tracing back\nto David.  It seems reasonable to assume, therefore, that Jesus\nwas Semitic.\n	As an interesting aside, Jesus' being semitic makes him\nneither "white" nor "black," and in some sense underscores the\npoint made earlier that his color was not important, it was his\nmessage, his grace, and his divinity that we should concentrate\non.\n	Finally, I would direct anyone interested in African\ninvolvement in the church to the account of the conversion of\nthe Ethiopian eunuch in Acts chapter 9 (I think it's chapter\n9).  This is one of the earliest conversions, and the eunuch,\ntreasurer to the queen of the Ethiopians, was definitely\nAfrican.  Because "Ethiopia" at that time indicated a region\njust south of Egypt, many also speculate that this man was not\nonly the first African Christian, but the first black Christian\nas well.  \nGod bless,\nCharles Campbell
If I am not mistaken, the Jewish family names Cohen, Kahn, etc.\nare considered to be legitimate indicators of descent from Aaron.\nThe family names Levi, Levene, etc. are considered to be legitimate\nindicators of descent from Levi. The main legal issue is the purification\nof the priesthood, which is supposed to involve finding the ashes of\nof the red heifer last used for this purpose 2000 years ago.\n_______________________________________________________________________________
But what if the geologists are wrong and these people are warning of a\nnon-existent danger?  Analogies can only push an argument so far (on both\nsides).  Both Melinda's and yours assume the premises used to set up your\nrespective analogies are true and thus the correct conclusion will arise.\n\nThe important point to note is the different directions both sides come from.\nChristians believe they know the TRUTH and thus believe they have the right\n(and duty) to tell the TRUTH to all.  \n\nChristians can get offended if others do not believe (what is self-evidently\nto them) the TRUTH. Non-christians do not believe this is the TRUTH and get\noffended at them because they (christians) claim to know the TRUTH.\n\n(BTW this argument goes for anyone, I am not just bagging christians)\n\nNeither side can be really reconciled unless one of the parties changes their\nmind.  As Melinda pointed out, there is no point in arguing along these lines\nbecause both approach from a different premise.  A more useful line of\ndiscussion is WHY people believe in particular faiths.\n\nPersonally, I don't mind what anyone believes as long as they allow me mine\nand we can all live peacefully.
[stuff deleted for brevity]\n\n\nYour very starting point is wrong.  Christianity is not based on following\na moral standard.  "For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith...\nNOT BY WORKS so that no man may boast."  (Eph. 2:7-8)  You say that\nyou know the Bible well, and can recognize (do you mean recite?) many\npassages from memory.  That could very well be so.  However, it looks like\nthere are a few more passages that you should pay attention to.  (Titus 3:5\nand James 2:10 are among them.)\n\nObedience to the moral law is imporant.  However, it is supposed to be the\nresult of turning your life over to Christ and becoming a Christian.  It is\nby no means the starting point.
Gifts of the Spirit should not be seen as an endorsement of ones behavior.\nA lot of people have suffered because of similar beliefs.  Jesus said\nthat people would come to Him saying "Lord, Lord," and proclaiming\nthe miraculous works they had done in His name.  Jesus would tell\nthem that they were workers of iniquity that do not know Him, and to\ndepart from Him.  \n\nThat is not to say that this will happen to everyone who commits a homosexual\nsin.  If the Holy Spirit were only given to the morally perfect, He would\nnot be given to me, or any of us.  God can forgive any sin, if we repent.\nBut people should be careful not to think, "God has given me a gift of\nthe Spirit, it must be okay to be gay."  That is dangerous (see also hebrews\n6 about those who have partaken of the Holy Spirit and of the powers of \nthe world to come.)\n\n\nJesus doesn't ask us to change our own nature.  We cannot lift ourselves\nout of our own sin- but we must submit to His hand as He changes our\nnature.  Practicing homosexual acts and homosexual lusts violates the\nmorality that God has set forth.  \n\nIf you don't believe that, and think those of us who do are just ignorant,\nthen at least consider us weak in the faith and be celebate for our sake's.\nIs practicing homosexuality worth the cost of a soul, whether it be the\nhomosexual's or the one considered "ignorant?"
I agree entirely.  Speaking as an atheist (heterosexual, for what it's\nworth), this is one of the least attractive parts of some varieties of\nChristianity.  Although I'm sure it's possible to argue theologically\nthat we shouldn't make analogies between discrimination on the basis\nof sex and race and discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation,\nmorally the case looks unanswerable (for those outside religion): the\nthree forms _are_ analogous; we shouldn't discriminate on the basis of\nsex, race or sexual orientation.\n\nI found the moderator's FAQs on the subject instructive, and recommend\neveryone to read them.\n\nThere seem to be three different levels of acceptance:\n\n1) Regard homosexual orientation as a sin (or evil, whatever)\n2) Regard homosexual behaviour as a sin, but accept orientation\n(though presumably orientation is unfortunate) and dislike people who\nindulge\n3) As 2, but "love the sinner"\n4) Accept homosexuality altogether.\n\nMy experience is that 3 is the most common attitude (I imagine 1 and 2\nare limited to a few fundamentalist sects).\n\nI suppose I can go along with 3, except that I have this feeling that\na 14--15 year old living in a community with this attitude, on\ndiscovering that they were more attracted to members of the same sex,\nwould not feel the love of the community, but would rather feel the\npressure not to exhibit their feelings.  I'm not saying that the\ncommunity (in particular the parents) would not love the child, but I\nsuspect the child would not feel loved.
For the Lord Himself will descend from Heaven with a shout, with the voice\nof an archangel, and with the trumpet of God. And the dead in Christ will\nrise first. Then we who are alive and remain will be caught up together\nto meet the Lord in the air. And thus we shall always be with the Lord.
The "so sacred it's secret" explanation is a bit misleading.  While\nthere is a profound reverence for the temple endowment, there is no\ninjunction against discussing the ceremony itself in public.  But\nsince public discussion is often irreverent, most Mormons would rather\nkeep silent than have a cherished practice maligned.\n\nBut there are certain elements of the ceremony which participants\nexplicitly covenant not to reveal except in conjunction with the\nceremony itself.\n\n\nThere are other interpretations to Christian history in this matter.\nOne must recall that most of what we know about the Gnostics was\nwritten by their enemies.  Eusebius claims that Jesus imparted secret\ninformation to Peter, James, and John after His resurrection, and that\nthose apostles transmitted that information to the rest of the Twelve\n(Eusebius, _Historia Ecclesiastica_ II 1:3-4).\n\nIrenaeus claims this information was passed on to the priests and\nbishops (_Against Heresies_ IV 33:8), but Eusebius disagrees.  He\nclaims the secret ceremonies of the Christian church perished with the\napostles.  Interestingly enough, Eusebius refers to the groups which\nwe today call Gnostics as promulgators of a false gnosis (Eusebius,\nop. cit., III, 32:7-8).  His gripe was not that thay professed *a*\ngnosis, but that they had the *wrong* one.\n\nWritings dealing with Jesus' post-resurrection teachings emphasize\nsecrecy -- not so much a concealment as a policy of not teaching\ncertain things indiscriminately.  In one story, Simon Magus opens a\ndialog with Peter on the nature of God.  Peter's response is "You seem\nto me not to know what a father and a God is: But I could tell you\nboth whence souls are, and when and how they were made; but it is not\npermitted to me now to disclose these things to you" (_Clementine\nRecognitions_ II, 60).  If any one theme underlies the _Recognitions_\nit is the idea that certain doctrines are not to be idly taught, but\ncan be had after a certain level of spiritual maturity is reached.\n\nNow one can approach this and other such evidence in many ways.  I\ndon't intend that everyone interpret Christian history as I do, but I\nbelieve that evidence exists (favorably interpreted, of course) of\nearly Christian rites analogous to those practiced by Mormons today.\n\n\nBut if Judaism and Christianity had such ceremonies, would you expect\nto read about them in public documents?  One can search the Book of\nMormon and other Mormon scripture and find almost no information on\ntemple worship.  Yes, you could establish that Mormons worship in\ntemples, but you would probably be hard pressed to characterize that\nworship.  On that basis, can we conclude that the Bible explains *all*\npractices which might have taken place, and that absence of such\ndescriptions proves they did not exist?\n\nMormon scholar Dr. Hugh Nibley offers us a list of scriptures from\nwhich I have taken a few:\n\n1. "It is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of\nheaven, but to them it is not given" (Matt. 13:11).\n\n2. "All men cannot receive this saying, save they to whom it is given"\n(Matt. 19:11).\n\n3. "I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them\nnow" (John 16:12).\n\n4. "The time cometh, when I shall no more speak unto you in proverbs,\nbut I shall shew you plainly of the Father" (John 16:25).\n\n5. "... unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter"\n(1 Cor. 3:1-2).\n\n6. "Many things ... I would not write with paper and ink; but I ...\ncome unto you and speak face to face" (2 Jn. 1:12).\n\n(Nibley, _Since Cumorah_, pp. 92-94)\n\nAgain, these can also be interpreted many different ways.  I believe\nthey serve to show that not all doctrines which could have been taught\nwere actually taught openly.\n\n\nHistorically, Joseph Smith had been adiministering the temple\nendowment ceremony for nearly a year before joining the Freemasons.\nThere is diary evidence which supports a claim that the rite did not\nchange after Smith became a Mason.  It can be argued that Smith had\nample exposure to Masonic proceedings through the burlesque of his\ntime and through his brother Hyrum (a Mason), though no specific\nconnection has yet been established.\n\nMy conversations with Masons (with respect to temple rite\ntranscriptions which have appeared on the net) have led me to believe\nthat the connection from Masonry to Mormonism is fairly tenuous.  As\nour moderator notes, most of what was similar was removed in the\nrecent revisions to the temple ceremony.  I believe that critics who\ncharge that Mormon rites were lifted from Freemasonry do not have\nadequate knowledge of the rites in question.\n-- \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n         Jay Windley  *  University of Utah  *  Salt Lake City\n                    jwindley@asylum.cs.utah.edu

More correctly: when people die, they cease to exist.\n\n\n\n The idea I've gotten is that to christians, Hell is -- like Heaven --\n afterlife; i.e, you don't cease to exist, but are subjected to eternal \n torture (well, that's the orthodox idea anyway; "eternal death" if you\n prefer that). Atheists don't believe in any sort of afterlife.\n\n\n I think it's safe to say that Hell was never intended metaphorical. Certainly\n not the equivalent of ceasing to exist. Some christian concepts are indeed\n metaphors, but your idea of Hell is a 20th century interpretation. It is, of\n course, nice to see that even christianity might evolve to fit the worldview \n of modern age, but I fear the church will not accept it. Understandably, per-\n haps, because if you accept that Hell is a metaphor, then you're one step\n closer to turning God into a metaphor as well.
I have also heard it called an expression of mercy, because Heaven would be\nfar more agonizing for those who had rejected God.
I have been looking at some of the recent productions on homosexuality\nand decided that I was interested in videotaped copies of these.

So long as we think that good things are what we *have* to do rather than\nwhat we come to *want* to do, we miss the point. The more we love God; the\nmore we come to love what and whom He loves.\n\nWhen I find that what I am doing is not good, it is not a sign to try\neven harder (Romans 7:14-8:2); it is a sign to seek God. When I am aware \nof Jesus' presence, I usually want what He wants. It is His strenth, His love \nthat empowers my weakness.
Here is some material by Michael Davies on the subject of schism in\ngeneral and Archishop Lefebvre in particular.  He wrote it around\n1990.  The first part of the two-part article was on the scandalous\nactivities of Archbishop Weakland (in this country), but I cut all\nthat.  And I pared down the rest to what was relevant.\n\nJoe Buehler\n\n...\n\nSchism and Disobedience\n\nAccording to St. Thomas Aquinas, schism consists primarily in a\nrefusal of submission to the Pope or communion with the members of the\nChurch united to him. On first sight it would appear that, whatever\nthe subjective motivation of the Archbishop, as discussed above, he\nmust be in a state of objective schism as he has refused to submit to\nthe Pope on a very grave matter involving his supreme power of\njurisdiction. However, standard Catholic textbooks of theology make it\nclear that while all schisms involve disobedience not all acts of\ndisobedience are schismatic. If this were so, as was noted at the\nbeginning of this article, it would mean that the number of American\nbishops who are not schismatic would not reach double figures.\n\nThe distinction between disobedience and schism is made very clear in\nthe article on schism in the very authoritative Dictionnaire de\nTheologie Catholique. The article is by Father Yves Congar who is\ncertainly no friend of Archbishop Lefebvre.  He explains that schism\nand disobedience are so similar that they are often confused. Father\nCongar writes that schism involves a refusal to accept the existence\nof legitimate authority in the Church, for example, Luther's rejection\nof the papacy. Father Congar explains that the refusal to accept a\ndecision of legitimate authority in a particular instance does not\nconstitute schism but disobedience.  The Catholic Encyclopedia\nexplains that for a Catholic to be truly schismatic he would have to\nintend "to sever himself from the Church as far as in him lies."  It\nadds that "not every disobedience is schism; in order to possess this\ncharacter it must include besides the transgression of the command of\nthe superiors, a denial of their divine right to command."Not only\ndoes Mgr. Lefebvre not deny the divine right of the Pope to command,\nbut he affirms repeatedly his recognition of the Pope's authority and\nhis intention of never breaking away from Rome. The Archbishop made\nhis attitude clear in the July/August 1989 issue of 30 Days: "We pray\nfor the Pope every day. Nothing has changed with the consecrations\nlast June 30. We are not sedevacantists. We recognize in John Paul II\nthe legitimate Pope of the Catholic Church. We don't even say that he\nis a heretical Pope. We only say that his Modernist actions favor\nheresy."\n\n...\n\nIntrinsically Schismatic?\n\nThe principal argument used by those claiming that Mgr. Lefebvre is in\nschism is that the consecration of a bishop without a papal mandate is\nan intrinsically schismatic act. A bishop who carries out such a\nconsecration, it is claimed, becomes ipso facto a schismatic. This is\nnot true. If such a consecration is an intrinsically schismatic act it\nwould always have involved the penalty of excommunication. In the 1917\nCode of Canon Law the offence was punished only by suspension (see\nCanon 2370 of the 1917 Code). Pope Pius XII had raised the penalty to\nexcommunication as a response to the establishment of a schismatic\nchurch in China. The consecration of these illicit Chinese bishops\ndiffered radically from the consecrations carried out by Mgr. Lefebvre\nas the professed intention was to repudiate the authority of the Pope,\nthat is, to deny that he has the right to govern the Church, and the\nillicitly consecrated Chinese bishops were given a mandate to exercise\nan apostolic mission. Neither Archbishop Lefebvre nor any of the\nbishops he has consecrated claim that they have powers of\njurisdiction. They have been consecrated solely for the purpose of\nensuring the survival of the Society by carrying out ordinations and\nalso to perform confirmations. I do not wish to minimize in any way\nthe gravity of the step take by Mgr. Lefebvre. The consecration of\nbishops without a papal mandate is far more serious matter than the\nordination of priests as it involves a refusal in practice of the\nprimacy or jurisdiction belonging by divine right to the Roman\nPontiff. But the Archbishop could argue that the crisis afflicting the\nChurch could not be more grave, and that grave measures were needed in\nresponse.\n\nIt appears to be taken for granted by most of the Archbishop's critics\nthat he was excommunicated for the offense of schism, and the Vatican\nhas certainly been guilty of fostering this impression.  There is not\nso much as a modicum of truth in this allegation. The New Code of\nCanon Law includes a section beginning with Canon 1364 entitled\n"Penalties for Specific Offenses" (De Poenis in Singula Dicta). The\nfirst part deals with "Offenses against Religion and the Unity of the\nChurch" (De Delictis contra Religionem et Ecclesiae Unitatem). Canon\n1364 deals with the offense of schism which is, evidently, together\nwith apostasy and heresy, one of the three fundamental offenses\nagainst the unity of the Church.\n\nBut the Archbishop was not excommunicated under the terms of this\ncanon or, indeed, under any canon involving an offense against\nreligion or the unity of the church. The canon cited in his\nexcommunication comes from the third section of "Penalties for\nSpecific Offenses" which is entitled "Usurpation of Ecclesial\nFunctions and Offenses in their Exercise" (De Munerum Ecclesiasticorum\nUsurpatione Degue Delictis iniis Exercendis). The canon in question is\nCanon 1382, which reads: "A bishop who consecrates someone bishop and\nthe person who receives such a consecration from a bishop without a\npontifical mandate incur an automatic (latae sententiae)\nexcommunication reserved to the Holy See."\n\nThe scandalous attempts to smear Archbishop Lefebvre with the offense\nof schism are, then, contrary to both truth and charity. A comparable\nsmear under civil as opposed to ecclesiastical law would certainly\njustify legal action for libel involving massive damages. An accurate\nparallel would be to state that a man convicted of manslaughter had\nbeen convicted of first degree murder.\n\nI must stress that what I have written here is not the dubious opinion\nof laymen unversed in the intricacies of Canon Law. Canon lawyers\nwithout the least shred of sympathy for Mgr. Lefebvre have repudiated\nthe charge of schism made against him as totally untenable. Father\nPatrick Yaldrini, Dean of the Faculty of Canon Law of the Institut\nCatholique in Paris noted in the 4 July 1988 issue of Valeurs\nactuelles that, as I have just explained, Mgr.  Lefebvre was not\nexcommunicated for schism but for the usurpation of an ecclesiastical\nfunction. He added that it is not the consecration of a bishop which\nconstitutes schism but the conferral of an apostolic mission upon the\nillicitly consecrated bishop. It is this usurpation of the powers of\nthe sovereign pontiff which proves the intention of establishing a\nparallel Church.\n\nCardinal Rosalio Lara, President of the Pontifical Commission for the\nAuthentic Interpretation of Canon Law, commented on the consecrations\nin the 10 July 1988 issue of la Repubblica. It would be hard to\n\n    The act of consecrating a bishop (without a papal mandate) is not\n    in itself a schismatic act. In fact, the Code that deals with\n    offenses is divided into two sections. One deals with offenses\n    against religion and the unity of the Church, and these are\n    apostasy, schism, and heresy. Consecrating a bishop with a\n    pontifical mandate is, on the contrary, an offense against the\n    exercise of a specific ministry. For example, in the case of the\n    consecrations carried out by the Vietnamese Archbishop Ngo Dinh\n    Thuc in 1976 and 1983, although the Archbishop was excommunicated\n    he was not considered to have committed a schismatic act because\n    there was no intention of a breach with the Church.\n\n....\n\nIt is not simply unjust but ludicrous to suggest that in consecrating\nbishops without a papal mandate Archbishop Lefebvre had the least\nintent of establishing a schismatic church. He is not a schismatic and\nwill never be a schismatic. The Archbishop considers correctly that\nthe the Church is undergoing its worst crisis since the Arian heresy,\nand that for the good of the Church it was necessary for him to\nconsecrate the four bishops to ensure the future of his Society. Canon\nLaw provides for just such a situation, and even if one believes that\nthe future of the Society could have been guaranteed without these\nconsecrations, the fact that the Archbishop believed sincerely that it\ncould not means, as Canon Law states clearly, that he has not incurred\nexcommunication. Furthermore, while the Vatican allows such prelates\nas Archbishop Weakland to undermine the Faith with impunity it cannot\nexpect Catholics to pay the least attention to its sanctions against a\ngreat and orthodox Archbishop whose entire life has been devoted to\nthe service of the Church and the salvation of souls.\n\nDr. Eric M. de Saventhem, President of the International Una Voce\nAssociation, is one of the best informed laymen in the Church, and he\nknows the Archbishop intimately. Dr. de Saventhem, like myself, has no\ngreater desire than to see a reconciliation between Mgr. Lefebvre and\nthe Holy See during the Archbishop's lifetime. A quotation from a\nstatement by Dr. de Saventhem which was published in the 15 February\n1989 Remnant merits careful study:
.\n           It's my understanding that the U.S. Supreme Court has never \n       given a legal definition of religion.  This despite the many \n       cases involving religion that have come before the Court. \n           Can anyone verify or falsify this?  \n           Has any state or other government tried to give a legal \n       definition of religion?

Being a parent in need of some help, I ask that you bear with me while I\ndescribe the situation which plagues me...\n\nI am a divorced father. Chance would have it that "my weekend" with my \ndaughter has fallen upon Easter Weekend this year.\n\nAlthough I am Presbyterian, I had married a Catholic woman. We decided\nthat the Catholic moray of indoctrination of the spouse into the faith\nwas too confining (and restrictive due to time as we had already set a\ndate), and we were married in a Christian Church which was non-denominational.\n\nDuring the years of our marriage, we did not often attend church. \n\nWhen our daughter was born, some years later, my wife insisted that she \nbe baptised as Catholic. This wasn't a problem with me.\n\nDuring a separation of five years, my ex-wife was taken ill with a disease\nthat affected her mental capacities. She was confined to a mental ward for\ntwo months before it was diagnosed. It has since been treated "effectively".\n\nIn other words, professionals have deemed her a functioning member of society.\n\nDuring the recuperation, my ex-wife has embraced Buddism. Her influence over\nmy daughter has been substantial, and has primarily allowed me only Saturday\nvisitation for a number of years. During this period I have read Bible study\nbooks to my daughter, and tried to keep her aware of her Christian heritage.\n\nLast fall, our divorce was finalized after a year of viscious divorce hearings.\nAt that time I was awarded visitation rights every other weekend. At that time,\nI started taking my daughter to church quite often, although not every weekend.\nI did this to attempt to strengthen the Christian ethic and expose her to a\nreligious community.\n\nToday, Easter Sunday, I took my daughter to church. When it came time for \nCommunion, my daughter took the bread (The body of Christ) but left the wine\n(The blood of Christ) professing that she was too young for wine. She then\nballed the bread up in her hand and tried to descretely throw it under the\npew in front of us.\n\nI feel this was a slap in the face to me, my religion, and an afront to her\nreligious heritage. It can be construed as breaking several of the commandments\nif you try. I really felt dishonored by the action.\n\nMy daughter is only nine years old, but I think she should have been old and\nmature enough to realize her actions. I have difficulty blaming her directly\nfor religious teachings her mother swears to, but when I discussed this with\nmy daughter she made it clear she believed in Buddhism and not Christianity.\n\nMy initial response of anger (moderated) was to suggest if there is no faith\nin Christ then why does she celebrate Easter, or Christmas? I suggested I\nwould never force her to practice my religious beliefs by celebrating holidays\nwith her again.\n\nI do not want to "drive her from the fold", and would be willing to allow her\nto continue practicing Buddhism (as though I had a choice seeing her only\nfor two days out of fourteen) but I want her to want to embrace Christianity.\n\nAny suggestions?\n\nIf you have a response, please e-mail me a copy. (I'm not a regular reader\nof this newsgroup.) (Naturally, feel free to post too!)\n\nThanks, and I hope you've had a happy Easter.\n\nDrew
In response to a lot of email I've gotten, I need to clarify my position.\n\nI am not in favor of paganism.\n\nI am not in favor of the Easter Bunny or other non-Christian aspects of\nEaster as presently celebrated.  (Incidentally, Easter eggs are not\nnon-Christian; they are a way of ending the Lenten fast.)\n\nMy point was to distinguish between\n  (1) intentionally worshipping a pagan deity, and\n  (2) doing something which may once have had pagan associations, but\nnowadays is not understood or intended as such.\n\nMany people who are doing (2) are being accused of (1).\n\nIt would be illogical to claim that one is "really" worshipping a\npagan deity without knowing it.  Worship is a matter of intention.\nOne cannot worship without knowing that one is doing so.

The two historic facts that I think the most important are these:\n\n(1) If Jesus didn't rise from the dead, then he must have done something\nelse equally impressive, in order to create the observed amount of impact.\n\n(2) Nobody ever displayed the dead body of Jesus, even though both the\nJewish and the Roman authorities would have gained a lot by doing so\n(it would have discredited the Christians).

(Much thanks to Jayne K who is\nalready supporting me with kind words and prayers!)\n\nI've been working at this company for eight years in various\nengineering jobs.  I'm female.  Yesterday I counted and realized that\non seven different occasions I've been sexually harrassed at this\ncompany.  Seven times. Eight years. Yesterday was the most recent one;\nsomeone left an X-rated photo of a nude woman in my desk drawer.\n\nI'm really upset by this.  I suppose it could have been worse -- it\ncould have been a man having sex with a sheep or something.\n\nThere was no note.  I do not know if it was:\n\n	- someone's idea of an innocent joke, that went awry\n	- someone's sick idea of flirting\n	- an act of emotional terrorism (that worked!)\n\nI dreaded coming back to work today.  What if my boss comes in to ask\nme some kind of question, I don't know the answer so I take a military\nspecification down off from my shelf to look up the answer, and out\nfalls a picture of a man having sex with a sheep?  I generally have a\nBible on my desk for occasional inspiration; what if I open it up to\nCorinthians and find a picture a la the North American Man Boy Love\nAssociation?  I want to throw up just thinking about this stuff.\n\nI can lock up my desk, but I can't lock up every book I have in the\noffice.  I can't trust that someone won't shove something into my\nbriefcase or my coat pocket when I'm not looking so that I go home to\nfind such a picture, or a threat, or a raunchy note about what someone\nwants to do to my body.\n\nTo make it worse, the entire department went out to lunch yesterday to\ntreat our marvelous secretary to lunch.  The appointed hour for\nleaving was 11:30.  I was working in another building but wanted to go\nto the lunch.  So I returned at 11:25, only to find that ever single\nperson had already left for lunch.  They left at 11:15 or so.  No one\ncould be bothered to call me at the other building, even though my\nnumber was posted.  So, I came back to a department that looked like a\nneutron bomb had gone off and I was the sole survivor.  This, despite\nthe fact that everyone knew how bad I felt about this naked woman being\nleft in my desk drawer.\n\nI need some prayers --- I can't stop crying. I am so deeply wounded\nthat it's ridiculous.\n\nI feel like I'm some kind of sub-human piece of garbage for people to\nreduce me and my sisters to simply sex organs and the sex act.  I feel\nlike I'm a sub-human piece of garbage that's not worthy of a simple\nphone call saying "We're leaving for Mary's lunch a little early so\nthat Bob can get back for a big 1:00 meeting..."\n\nPlease pray that my resentments will either go away, or be miraculously\nturned into something positive.  Please pray that whoever is torturing\nme so will stop, and find some healing for him- or herself. Please pray\nfor my being healed from this latest wound (which falls on top of a\nwhole slew of other wounds...).  Please pray that I can find a new job\nin a place where the corporate culture does its best to prevent such\nharrassment from happening in the first place, and swiftly acts\nappropriately when something occurs despite its best precautions. (This\ncompany, in my opinion, has pretty words about how sexual harrassment\nisn't tolerated but when you get right down to it, how is it that one\nfemale engineer can be touched inappropriately, left obsene or\nthreatening notes, left obscene pictures, spoken to lewdly, etc, seven\ntimes in eight years in the same place?  Pretty words from the company\ndo me no good when I'm terrified or healing from the latest assault.)\n\nAnd please pray that I don't turn into an automaton because of this.\nThat's my bad habit: "ignore it and it will go away", "you're not worth\nanyone's time so don't go talking to anyone about this", "you're right,\nyou are a sub-human piece of garbage and deserve to be treated this\nway", "you are just an object", "you prostitute your mind to this\ncompany so why can't others expect you to prostitute your body there as\nwell?", "what makes you think women aren't just possessions, and\nnothing more than sex organs and their ability to perform the sex act?"\nThis is the kind of thinking that can catapault one into a major\ndepressive episode; please pray that these thoughts don't come into\nmy head and stay there, triggering depression.\n\nPlease pray that this latest trauma doesn't come between me and God.\nIn a way, a wound like this is an invitation to a deeper connection to\nGod, and it's also a possible trigger for a spiritual crisis that can\nseparate one mentally from God.  (I know God doesn't drop me from his\nloving hand, but it's awfully easy for me to walk to the edge of the\nhand, look down, think I'm falling and forget that God's still holding\non to me.)\n\nAlthough this probably isn't entirely appropriate for this newsgroup,\nI really can use the kind of loving support you all provide.  For this\nreason I hope good Mr. Moderator allows me this latest indulgence.  After\nall, he's allowed me the thermometer note, and a few other off-the-wall\ntopics.\n\nThanks in advance to everyone for your support and prayers.  Peace to you,\nEsther
I am told that Planned Parenthood/SIECUS-style "values-free" methods, that\nteach contraceptive technology and advise kids how to make "choices",\nactually _increase_ pregnancy rates. I posted a long article on this a while\nback and will be happy to email a copy to any who are interested.  The\narticle included sources to contact for information on research verifying\nthese statements, and an outstanding source for info on acquiring\nabstinence-related curricula even in single-copy quantities for home use.\n\nThe same research produced the results that abstinence-related curricula\nwere found to _decrease_ pregnancy rates in teens.  I assume that it is\nreasonable to assume that the AIDS rate will fluctuate with the pregnancy\nrate.\n\nThe difference is not in "contraceptive technology" but in the values taught\nto the children.  The PP/SIECUS curricula taught the kids that they have\nlegitimate choices, while the abstinence related curricula taught them that\nthey did _not_ have _legitimate_ choices other than abstinence.  It is the\nvalues system that is the strongest determinent of the behavior behavior of\nthese kids.\n\nDespite the better track record of abstinence-related curricula, they are\nsuppressed in favor of curricula that produce an effect contrary to that\ndesired.  \n\nQuestion for further discussion (as they say in the textbooks):  Why don't\nwe teach "safe drug use" to kids, instead of drug abstinence?  Isn't it\nbecause we know that a class in "how to use drugs safely if you _choose_ to\nuse drugs" would increase drug use?  Why isn't "drug abstinence education"\nbarred from schools because it teaches "religion"?  Aren't we abandoning\nthose children who will use drugs anyway, and need instruction in their safe\nuse?

No, IMO, Mr. Stowell missed the point.\n\n\nMr. Stowell seems to have jumped rather strangely from truth to absolutes.\nI don't see how that necessarily follows.  \n\nAre all truths also absolutes?\nIs all of scripture truths (and therefore absolutes)?\n\nIf the answer to either of these questions is no, then perhaps you can \nexplain to me how you determine which parts of Scripture are truths, and\nwhich truths are absolutes.  And, who is qualified to make these \ndeterminations?  There is hardly consensus, even in evangelical \nChristianity (not to mention the rest of Christianity) regarding \nBiblical interpretation.\n\nI find Mr. Stowell's statement terribly simple-minded.
I agree that there is truth in scripture.  There are principles to be \nlearned from it.  Claiming that that truth is absolute, though, seems \nto imply a literal reading of the Bible.  If it were absolute truth \n(constant across time, culture, etc.) then no interpretation would be \nnecessary.\n\nIt may be that the lessons gleaned from various passages are different \nfrom person to person.  To me, that doesn't mean that one person is \nright and the other is wrong.  I believe that God transcends our simple \nminds, and that scripture may very well have been crafted with exactly \nthis intent.  God knows me, and knows that my needs are different \nfrom yours or anyone else's.  By claiming that scripture is absolute,\nthen at least one person in every disputed interpretation must be wrong.\nI just don't believe that God is that rigid.\n\n\nThis is where the arrogance comes in to play.  Since these principles \nare crystal clear to evangelicals, maybe the rest of us should just take\ntheir word for it?  Maybe it isn't at all crystal clear to *me* that \ntheir fundamental principles are either fundamental *or* principles.\n\nI think we've established that figuring out Biblical truth is a matter \nof human interpretation and therefore error-prone.  Yet you can still \nclaim that some of them may be crystal clear?  Maybe to a certain \nsegment of Christianity, but to all.\n\n\nNot at all.  I think it supports my position much more effectively \nthan yours.  :-)\n\nSo, I think that your position is:\nThe Bible is absolute truth, but as we are prone to error in our \ninterpretation, we cannot reliably determine if we have figured out \nwhat that truth is.\nDid I get that right?\n\nWhat's the point of spending all this time claiming and defending \nabsolute truth, when we can never know what those truths are, and we \ncan never (or at least shouldn't) act upon them?  What practical \ndifference can this make?

Greetings,\n\nProbably a tired old horse, but...  maybe with a slightly different\ntwist.  I wanted to know if there are any good English-language texts\nfor learning ancient Hebrew, and how these compare with German\neducational texts qualitywise, if anybody has an idea.  I can't figure\nout if I should buy one here for later study or wait until I get back to\nthe U.S.\n\nSomething I find interesting about studying theology in Germany is the\nfact that the students get their ancient language-learning out of the\nway early [I'm not a theology student, but I spend a lot of time with\nsuch folks] in their careers.  They take the first two years or so to just\ndo Greek and Latin and Hebrew [possibly Aramaic, too--who knows].\nWhat's it like at divinity schools or seminaries in the States?  Is\nthere a lot of language instruction done?  I really don't have a basis\nfor comparison.\n\nRegards, Phil\n-- \nPhilip Sells                 Is anything too hard for the LORD?\nk053730@hobbes.kzoo.edu           --Gen. 18:14
If I believed in the God of the bible I would be very fearful of making\nthis statement. Doesn't it say those who judge will be judged by the\nsame measure? \n\n\nA God who must motivate through fear is not a God worthy of worship.\nIf the God Jesus spoke of did indeed exist he would not need hell to\nconvince people to worship him.\n\n\nIt was the myth of hell that made me finally realize that the whole thing\nwas untrue. If it hadn't been for hell I would still be a believer today.\nThe myth of hell made me realize that if there was a God that he was not\nthe all knowing and all good God he claimed to be. Why should I take such\na being at his word, even if there was evidence for his existance?
There was a recent discussion of Dungeons and Dragons and other role\nplaying games.  Since there is a lot of crossover between gamers and\nscience fiction and fantasy fans, I will mention that I am the editor\nand publisher of RADIO FREE THULCANRA, a Christian-oriented science\nfiction fanzine.  It is not a Christian magazine with a special\ninterest in science fiction.  It is a science fiction fanzine with a\nspecial interest in Christianity.  Gaming is not a major topic of\ndiscussion but it has come up in some letters.  (No, there are no\narguments about whether D&D is satanic.  People who think it is are\nnot likely to be reading RFT.)  Anyway, I am now working on the April\nissue.  I will send a sample copy to any reader of\nsoc.religion.christian who requests it.  It is printed on paper, so\nrequests should include a snail-mail address.\n-------\nMarty Helgesen\nBitnet: mnhcc@cunyvm   Internet: mnhcc@cunyvm.cuny.edu
[deletia- sig]\n\n[deletia- formalities]\n\nI probably should let this pass, it's not worth the time, and it's not\nreally intended for me. But I couldn't resist. A personal weakness of mine.\nJerkius Kneeus. Tragically incurable.\n\n\nNot so; I can prove that the existance of God is disputable\nby showing that people dispute it; This is easy: I dispute that\nGod exists. Simple.\n\nI missed your "Traditional Proofs" treatise, but the proofs I remember\nfrom the Summa Theologic (the 5 ways I think it was) were rather poor\nstuff. The Ontological argument is about a billion times better, imho.\n\nI would think you'd want non-traditional proofs, considering the general\nfailure of the traditional proofs: at least the ones I know of.\n(I am thinking of the Ontological Argument, the Cosmological Argument and\nthe Teleological argument. Those are the ones traditional enough to\nhave funny names, anyway.)\n\n\nThis is the real question. So to discuss it, I'll assume God exists.\nOtherwise, there is no heavenly authority to babble about.\n\n\nPlease show this is the case. I am familiar with the First Cause\nargument, and I'll accept (for the sake of argument) that there\nis a First Cause, even though I find some of its premices\nquestionable. The rest you'll have to show. This includes\nthat the First Cause is God.\n\n\nGot it. I deny that God is all good. So there.\n\n\nThis isn't self-consistent: if humans must renew the relationship,\nthen God (incarnate or not) can't do it. Well, unless you think God is\nhuman. Granted, God made himself 'human', but this is nonetheless cheating:\nThe intent of the statement is clearly that man has to fix the problem\nhe caused. God fixing it- even by indirect means- contradicts this.\n\n\nWhy?\n\nAlso, why assume said claim is true anyway?\n\nIf *I* claim to be Truth, are you bound by reason to follow me?\n\n\n:)\n\nUndoubtably. Do you mean to imply we should all obey the commands of the\nMarines without question? You seem to imply this about God, and\nthat the Marines are similar in this respect.. If this is not what\nyou are trying to say, they please explain what it is you are saying,\nas I have missed it.\n\n\nWhy? Why not question it? Even if it *is* truth, we cannot know this\ncertainly, so why is it so irrational to question? Perhaps we will\nthus discover that we were wrong.\n\nYou assert that God is Truth and we can't question Truth. But\nI assert that God is not Truth and anyway we can question Truth.\nHow is it my assertion is less good than yours?\n\n\nOh?\n\nI hereby deny 1+1=2.\n\nI hope you'll agree 1+1=2 is the truth.\n\nGranted, I look pretty damn silly saying something like that,\nbut I needed something we'd both agree was clearly true.\n\nNow, you'll notice no stormtroopers have marched in to drag\nme off to the gulag. No heaven lighting bolts either. No mysterious\nnet outages. I seem to be permited to say such things, absurd or not.\n\n\nThey are certainly not true. At least, the ones Newton derived are\nnot true, and are indeed wildly inaccurate at high speeds or small\ndistances. We do not have a set of Laws of Physics that always\nworks in all cases. If we did, Physics would be over already.\n\nScience is all about Questioning this sort of truth. If we didn't,\nwe'd still follow Aristotle. I'd generalize this a little more:\nIf you want to learn anything new, you MUST question the things\nyou Know (tm). Because you can always be wrong.\n\n\nEven presupposing that Truth may not be Denied, and may\nnot be Questioned, and that God is Truth, it only follows\nthat God may not be Denied or Questioned. NOT that he must\nbe obeyed!\n\nWe could unquestioningly DISobey him. How annoying of us.\nBut you have not connected denial with disobedience.\n\n---\n			- Dan "No Nickname" Johnson\nAnd God said "Jeeze, this is dull"... and it *WAS* dull. Genesis 0:0
I posted this a couple of weeks ago, and it doesn't seem to have appeared  \non the newsgroup, and I haven't had a reply from the moderator. We were  \nhaving intermittent problems with our mail at the time. Please excuse me  \nif you have seen this before...\n\nShould Christians fight?\n\nLast week Alastair posted some questions about fighting, and whether there  \nare such things as "justifiable wars". I have started looking into these  \nthings and have jotted down my findings as I go. I haven't answered all  \nhis questions yet, and I know what I have here is on a slightly different  \ntack, but possibly I'll be able to get into it more deeply later, and post  \nsome more info soon.\n\nOur duty to our neighbour:\n\nDo good to all men (Gal 6:10)\nLove our neighbour as ourselves (Matt 22:39)\n\nAct the part of the good Samaritan (Luke 10) toward any who may be in  \ntrouble. We will therefore render every possible assistance to an injured  \nman, and therefore should not be part of any organisation which causes  \npeople harm (even medical corps of the army etc).\n\nChristians are by faith "citizens of the commonwealth of Israel"  \n(Ephesians 2:11-12), and also recognise that "God rules in the kingdoms of  \nmen", and therefore we should not be taking part in any of the struggles  \nof those nations which we are not part of due to our faith.\n\nWe are to be "strangers and pilgrims" amongst the nations, so we are just  \npassing through, and not part of any nation or any national aspirations  \n(this can also be applied to politics etc, but that's another story). We  \nare not supposed to "strive" or "resist evil" (even "suffer yourselves to  \nbe defrauded") it is therefore incosistent for us to strive to assist in  \npreserving a state which Christ will destroy when he returns to set up  \nGod's kingdom.\n\nOur duty to the state.\n\n"Render therefore unto Caesar the things which be Caesar's and unto God  \nthe things which be God's" (Luke 20:25).\n"Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is no power  \nbut of God; the powers that be are ordained of God. Whosoever resisteth  \nthe power, resisteth the ordinance of God" (Rom 13:1-2).\n"Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake; whether  \nit be to king as supreme... for so is the will of God that with well doing  \nye may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men" (1 Pet 2:13-15)\n\nThese scriptures make it clear that submission to the powers that be is a  \ndivine command, but it is equally clear from Acts 5:19-29 that when any  \nordinance of man runs counter to God's law, we must refuse submission to  \nit. The reason for this is that we are God's "bond servants" and His  \nservice is our life's task. An example of the type of thing is in Col  \n3:22-23 where bondservants were to "work heartily as unto the Lord" - so  \nalso we should work as if our boss was God - i.e. "Pressed down, shaken  \ntogether, and running over"... oops - a bit of a side track there...\n\nIn the contests between the nations, we are on God's side - a side that is  \nnot fighting in the battle, but is "testifying" to the truth.\n\nWhen we believe in God and embrace His promises, we become "fellow  \ncitizens with the Saints and of the Household of God", and are no longer  \ninterested in associations of the world. Think of this in relation to  \nunions etc as well. Paul tells us to "lay aside every weight" that we may  \nrun "the race that is set before us", and if we are wise, we will discard  \nany association which would retard our progress - "Thou therefore endure  \nhardness as a good soldier of Jesus Christ. No man that warreth entangleth  \nhimself with the affairs of this life, that he may please him who hath  \nchosen him to be a soldier" (2 Tim 2:3-4).\n\nOne of these entanglements he warns about is "be ye not unequally yoked  \ntogether with unbelievers". One of the obvious applications of this is  \nmarriage with unbelievers, but it also covers things like business  \npartnerships and any other position where we may form a close association  \nwith any person or persons not believing the truth about God (in this case  \nthe army). The principle comes from Deut 22:10 - remember that as well as  \nthem being different animals of different strengths, one was clean and one  \nunclean under the law. These ideas are strongly stressed in 2 Cor 6:13-18  \n- I suggest you read this. The yoking also has another aspect - that of  \nservitude, and Jesus says "take my yoke upon you", so we are then yoked  \nwith Christ and cannot be yoked with unbelievers. We have already seen  \nthat we are bondservants of Christ, and Paul says "become not ye the  \nbondservants of men (1 Cor 7:23 RV).\n\nAn example from the Old Testament: the question is asked in 2 Chr 19:2  \n"Shouldest thou help the ungodly...?". The situation here is a good  \nexample of what happens when you are yoked together with unbelievers.  \nJehoshaphat was lucky to escape with his life. Here are the facts:\n1. He had made an affinity with Ahab, who had "sold himself to work  \nwickedness before the Lord" (1 Kings 21:25).\n2. When asked by Ahab to form a military alliance, he had agreed and said  \n"I am as thou art, my people as thy people" (1 Kings 22:4) - an unequal  \nyoking.\n3. He sttod firm in refusing the advice of the false prophets and insisted  \non hearing the prophet of the Lord (trying to do the right thing), he  \nfound that he was yoked and therefore couldn't break away from the evil  \nassociation he had made.\n\nGod says to us "Come out from among them and be ye separate, and touch not  \nthe unclean thing, and I will receive you and ye shall be my sons and  \ndaughters" (2 Cor 6:17).\n\nThis is more or less what I have found out so far - I'm still looking into  \nit, as I don't think I've answered all the questions raised by Alastair  \nyet. Heres a summary and a few things to think about:\n\nThe Christian in under command. Obedience to this command is an essential  \nfactor in his relationship with Christ (John 15:10,14).\n\nTotal dedication to this course of action is required (Romans 12:1-2).\n\nDisobedience compromises the close relationship between Christ and his  \nfollowers (1 Pet 2:7-8).\n\nWe are to be separated to God (Rom 6:4). This involves a master-servant  \nrelationship (Rom 6:12,16).\n\nNo man can serve two masters (Matt 6:24,13,14).\n\nAll that is in the 'Kosmos' is lust and pride - quite opposed to Gos (1  \nJohn 2:16). Christs kingdom is not of this world (i.e. not worldly in  \nnature) - if it was, his servants would fight to deliver him. If Christ is  \nour master and he was not delivered by his servants because his kingdom  \nwas not of this world, then his servants cannot possibly fight for another  \nmaster.\n\nStrangers and pilgrims have no rights, and we cannot swear allegiance to  \nanyone but God.\n\nThe servant of the Lord must not war but be gentle to all (2 Tim 2:24) -  \nthis does not just apply to war, but also to avoiding strife throughout  \nour lives. There is a war to be waged, not with man's weapons (2 Cor  \n10:3-4), but with God's armour (Eph6:13-20).\n\nI'll probably post some more when I've had time to look into things a bit  \nfurther.
Please realize that I am frequently getting in trouble for\nstraying from orthodoxy, but here is my opinion:\n\n\nI never thought of these two ideas being "against" each other.\nPeople might quibble about what "intrinsically" means but the\nreason we are sinners is because we do not behave as good as we\nare. The message of Christ is that each of us are not only good,\nbut great, that we can approach perfection, albeit perhaps through a \ndifferent technique than you claim Buddhism teaches. Because we do\nnot realize our greatness, we sin. Peter had no problem walking \non water until a little doubt crept in.\n\nDoesn't David ask in the 8th Psalm "what is man that you [God] \nshould care for him, but you have made him just a little lower \nthan the angels"?\n\nI probably exagerate in my mind what a scrawny little kid David\nwas, just as I probably exagerate what a gigantic monster Goliath\nwas, but David's power easily defeated Goliath's.\n\nRemember the rich young man who comes up to Jesus and asks what\nhe can do to enter the Kingdom, Jesus says follow the commandments.\nI always picture the smug look on his face as he says he's done that\nhis whole life, probably anticipating an "attaboy" from the \nMessiah. Instead Jesus gives him a harder task, sell everything\nand follow Him. Jesus is raising the bar. The desciples say\nhow can anyone do this if it's so hard even for rich people.\nJesus says anyone can do it, with God's help.\n\nJesus says not only can we avoid killing people, we can avoid\ngetting angry at people. Not only can we avoid committing\nadultery, we can control our own desires. \n\nI realize this was not your main point, but I wonder how other\npeople see this. \n\n\n(Please forgive any generalizations I am about to make.)\n\nYour point about how "hard" other religions are is a good one, just \nas your "Parting Question" is a tough question. I think that Muslims\nworship the same God as I do, we can learn from their name "submission".\nHindus and Buddhists and Taoists, etc. claim that "God" is impersonal. \nIs God personal or impersonal? I say yes, but if I think a little\nmore my answer is whichever is greater. I think it is greater \nto be a personal entity, with an individual consciousness, but\nyou're right that that might be a cultural bias. If I think more\nI must admit that God's personal nature is as far beyond my\nconception as His impersonal nature is beyond the Hindu's\nconception. If somehow Jesus could fit into Hindu cosmology\nthen maybe I wouldn't have a problem, though that is hard to imagine.\n\nAre there any former (or present) "Eastern Religion" members here \nwho could comment?
Sorry for posting this, but my e-mail keeps bouncing.  Maybe it will\nhelp others here, anyway, and therefore I pray others will read this.  It is\nactually a response from my Aunt, who has 5 kids, since I have none yet.\n\n     I'm posting this for a good Christian relative who does not have e-mail\naccess.  Since this aunt and uncle have 5 kids I felt they would be more\nrelevant than I, who have none (yet).\n\n     13-year-old (13YO) twins, 10YO boy, 6.5YO boy, 2YO girl\n\n     I don't call it spanking, but they do, so yes, very rarely.\n\n     I don't call it spanking because it's more of a reaction to something\nvery dangerous, such as trying to stick their finger in a fan or running\ninto the road.  Maybe 3-4 times for each except for the 2YO girl, who has\nnot been spanked yet.\n     They call it that because it *does* hurt their feelings, and of course\nI give all the hugs and stuff to ensure they know they're still loved.\n\n     No, that would be too painful.  If it's too traumatic they never recall\nwhy they were punished.  Besides, it must be immediate, and taking the time\nto go get a toolmeans you're not doing it right away, and that lessens the\nimpact.  It's very emotional for a child as it is - which is evidenced by the\nfact that a little slap on the rear - which hurts for perhaps 5 seconds -\nis called a spanking.\n     Lots of logical consequences - for instance, when 4YO Matthew dared\na good friend to jump out of his treehouse or he would push him out, I made\nsure they didn't play together for 5 days so he'd know that would make him\nlose friends very quickly.  He's never done anything like that since.\n     We also use time-out in their rooms - I use a timer so they don't keep\narguing with me over leaving, since it's hard to argue with a macine.\nI will go to the closed door and tell them timeout won't be over until they\ncalm down if they're too tantrumy.  I use the top of the stairs when they're\nreally young.\n\n     40\n\n     Bath, Ohio.  It's right outside of Akron, in the northeast part of Ohio.\n\n     No, and none of my kids would dream of it.  I hope you can use this to\nteach all parents that physical punishment isn't always required - parents use\nthat as an excuse to hit too hard.\n\n     Lots of timeouts, same as I use.  Our family and my husband's have never\nused spankings.  In fact, my grandmother in law was one of 11 kids, and they\nwere almost never spanked.  This was around the turn of the century.  And,\nnone of us has ever been afoul of the law - man-made or God's law.\n     Jesus says, referring to a small child whom he is holding, that "what\nye do to the least of these, ye do also to me."  The Bible also says in all\nthings to be kind, and merciful, and especially loving. (Colossians 3:12-15.)\nThere is no room for selfish anger, which I'll admit I've been tempted with\nat times.  When I've felt like spanking hard in anger, maybe the kid deserved\na little slap on the rear, but what I would have given would have been the\ndevil's work.  I could feel the temptation, and just angrily ordered the kid\nto his/her room and went to my room myself.  After praying and asking God's\nforgiveness, I was much calmer, and did not feel like spanking, but felt that\nwhat I had done was enough punishment.
OFM replies to a question on the multiplicity of translations of the bible,\n\n\nUnfortunately, this isn't true.  On another news group earlier this year,\nsomeone posted that the King James Bible was the divinely inspired version\nof the Bible in English and was, therefore, inerrant; all other English\ntranslations were from Satan, trying to deceive the body of Christ.  A\nfew years ago, the pastor of a church I was attending showed me a poster\nadvertising the availability of a certain man to address congregations.\nVery prominantly on the poster was the fact that the man used only the KJV.\nThe idea that the KJV is THE English Bible is more prevalent than many\nmight think.\n\n  -- Scott at Brandeis
Hello all.  We are doing a bible study (at my college) on Revelations.  We\nhave been doing pretty good as far as getting some sort of reasonable\ninterpretation.  We are now on chapters 17 and 18 which talk about the\nwoman on the beast and the fall of Babylon.  I believe the beast is the\nAntichrist (some may differ but it seems obvious) and the woman represents\nBabylon which stands for Rome or the Roman Catholic Church.  What are some\nviews on this interpretation?  Is the falling Babylon in chapter 18 the same\nBabylon in as in chapter 17?  The Catholic church?\nHate to step on toes.\nthanks\n\n-------- \nJimmy Buddenberg       INTERNET:  jbuddenberg@vax.cns.muskingum.edu\nMuskingum College
Bill Burns was looking for a description of the differnces  between the\nCatholic and Lutheran churches.\n\nI'd recommend Prof. William Whalen's book "Separated Brethren".  It's\nan overview of common US denominations, intended for a Catholic\naudience.
Satan was one of God's highest ranking angels, like Uriel, Raphael,\nMichael, and Gabriel.  In fact, his name was Satanel.  He did challenge\nGod's authority and got kicked out of heaven.  A lot of the mythology\nof Satan (he lost the -el suffix when he fell) comes from the\nBook of Enoch and is not found in the bible.\n\nRead the Book of Enoch, available thru bookstores, or get the book\ncalled "Angels: an endangered species" (I think).
Hi,\n   I'd like to subscribe to Leadership Magazine but wonder if there is one on\ndisk instead of on paper. Having it on disk would save me retyping\nillustrations, etc into a word processor. It's just cut and paste.\n   If there are other good Christian magazines like Leadership on disk media,\nI'd appreciate any info.
i did a workshop on this for an episcopalian student gathering a\ncouple months ago because i wanted to know the answer too.  as far as\ni could tell, although that story was never specifically _told_ in the\nbible, many references are made to it, primarily in the new testament.\nin the old testament there is actually an entirely different view of\nsatan as a (excuse the pun) "devil's advocate" for yahweh.  see the\nbook of job.  getting back to the fallen angel story, there are _no_\nreferences to "lucifer" in the bible except for a mistranslation of\n"the morning star" in the king james version (isaiah 14:12), which\nprobably referred to a babylonian monarch much in the same was as "the\nsun king" referred to louis xiv.  \n\nall in all, i don't know where the story _came from_; it may have been\nrolling around for a long time, or milton (_paradise lost_) may have\ninvented it.  sorry for the sketchiness of the rest of this, but i am\nin a hurry and need to eat lunch!  feel free to email me about the\nother stuff i found out....  (although a lot of it is just the result\nof a bible concordance program called "quickverse" -- it's really\nlousy, by the way -- don't buy it.)
There is some controversy in my denomination as to what authority is vested \nin the pastor.  I am still forming my opinion.  I am solicing opinions, and \nreferences for what that is, how much, and how it should be used.\n\n   As a general reference, I would not exclude responses from different \ndenominations based on Biblical teachings, but you have to understand our \nchurch is independent, protestant and likely to be much different from those \nthat follow ecclesiastical authority in the church.  We may need to discuss \nthe roles of deacons and elders.\n\nThanks for your replies.
: Having met Peter Kingston (of WBT) some years back, he struck me \n: as an exemplery and dedicated Christian whose main concern was with\n: translation of the Word of God and the welfare of the people\n: group he was serving.\n: WBT literature is concerned mainly with providing Scripture\n: in minority languages.\n\nYes, in fact Peter is now at Wycliffe HQ in the U.K., and is a member of my\nchurch. I would fully endorse the above -- Peter is a very Godly man, with a\npassion for serving Christ.\n\nOn one occasion he specifically addressed the issue of ``cultural\ninterference'' in a sermon, presumably from his experience of allegations\ndirected at Wycliffe. (Perhaps I could find the tape...?)
But then, on the other hand, if you really loved that King more\nthan you did yourself, and He loved you to the point of assuring\nyou that the eternal time spent with him would be eternal ecstasy,\nwould you really opt for that choice?
Which Version of the Bible do you consider to be the most\naccurate translation?
The problems with Catholic liturgy are likely to continue for\nsome time.  The problem is, in a nutshell, this: the Liturgy is a\nsymbolic action - in other words Catholics do [or should] believe that\nthe _signs_ during the mass - Water, Blessings, Vestments, Altar,\nRelics, etc - are real. That is the sprinkling of water bestows real,\nalmost tangible, holiness, the Vestments are a real indication of real\nsacred time. The point of a _symbol_ is that it is understood by all\nto be connected to an underlying REAL referent. This kind of thinking\nprecludes analysis; holy water is not holy because of anything, it\nsimply IS holy.\n\nBut, modern westerners find it extremely difficult, especially if\nwell- educated, to think of the mass as a symbol. We are more likely\nto see it as a _sign_, ie an action that represents grace, but which\ncould be replaced with other signs. In concrete terms, this means the\nmass has become a commercial for God's grace rather than the real\nthing. You can mess around with a commercial in a way you wouldn't\ndare with the real thing [ask Coca-Cola Co.!]. These attitudes have\nbeen encouraged by Liturgy workshops, etc. which instead of focusing\non _how_ to do do liturgy, have focused on how to create a meaning in\nliturgy. You can only create signs, symbols have to come from God [or\nthe heart, or somewhere deeper than analysis. The most dramatic\nexample of this shift in understanding has been in the treatment of\nthe sacred species [the consecrated host and wine]. Now, with pita\nbread etc, it is common to come away from the altar with hands covered\nin particles. If the Host is a sign of Grace, this isnt and issue; but\nCatholics in the past would have been distraught at this real\ndesacration of the real symbol of Jesus' body.\n\nModern Catholic liturgy  is caught in this epistemological shift. We\ntry to perfrom the old rites, but then we have some liturgomaniac\npriest get up and 'explain' what we are doing - so we stop doing it and\nstart pretending to do it. This is not a soul filling experience.\nIt doesn't help BTW that we have got stuck witha huge amount of two and\nthree chord ersatz-folk music [again a result of mis-analysis: complicated\ntunes are in fact easier to remember than simple ones - this was the\ngenius of Wesley and the 19C Anglican hymn writers]. Taize' is only\nslightly better.\n\nWhat are we to do? Well I suggest rejecting the parish system if it\ndoesn't work for you. Search out a Church where the liturgy is well\nprepared not well-explained. They exist in every city. This is not BTW\na matter of particular style: the music might be old or new. It is\nthe attitude of the church that counts. Also, note that a conservative\nliturgy - harking back to pre-Vatican II days, does not necessarily mean\nthe Church will be socially conservative.\n\nIn NYC I can recommend:\n	Corpus Christi - W 12st St.\n	Corpus Christi - W 12st St. - very conservative liturgy, \n	St. Joseph's, Greenwich Village.  - Modern, "clean", largely gay\n	Oratorian Church, Brooklyn - Very beautiful\n\nAvoid, anywhere, anytime a church with electric candles.\n\nHappy Easter: Christos Aneste', Christos Voskrezhne, Christ is Risen

Why would you say "especially Christianity"?
Perhaps we have different definitions of absolute then.  To me,\nan absolute is something that is constant across time, culture,\nsituations, etc.  True in every instance possible.  Do you agree\nwith this definition?  I think you do:\n\n\nA simple example:\n\nIn the New Testament (sorry I don't have a Bible at work, and can't\nprovide a reference), women are instructed to be silent and cover\ntheir heads in church.  Now, this is scripture.  By your definition, \nthis is truth and therefore absolute.  \n\nDo women in your church speak?  Do they cover their heads?  If all \nscripture is absolute truth, it seems to me that women speaking in and \ncoming to church with bare heads should be intolerable to evangelicals.  \nYet, clearly, women do speak in evangelical churches and come with bare \nheads.  (At least this was the case in the evangelical churches I grew \nup in.)\n\nEvangelicals are clearly not taking this particular part of scripture \nto be absolute truth.  (And there are plenty of other examples.)\nCan you reconcile this?\n\n\nI don't claim that there are *no* absolutes.  I think there are very\nfew, though, and determining absolutes is difficult.\n\n\n\nBut you are claiming that all of Scripture is absolute.  How can you\ndetermine absolutes derived from Scripture when you can't agree how\nto interpret the Scripture?  \n\nIt's very difficult to see how you can claim something which is based \non your own *interpretation* is absolute.  Do you deny that your own\nbackground, education, prejudices, etc. come into play when you read the \nBible, and determine how to interpret a passsage?  Do you deny that \nyou in fact interpret?
Hi everyone, \n	   I'm a commited Christian that is battling with a problem.  I know\nthat romans talks about how we are saved by our faith not our deeds, yet\nhebrews and james say that faith without deeds is useless, saying' You fools,\ndo you still think that just believing is enough?'\n\nNow if someone is fully believing but there life is totally lead by themselves\nand not by God, according to Romans that person is still saved by there faith.\nBut then there is the bit which says that God preferes someone who is cold to\nhim (i.e. doesn't know him - condemned) so a lukewarm Christian someone who\nknows and believes in God but doesn't make any attempt to live by the bible.\n\nNow I am of the opinion that you a saved through faith alone (not what you do)\nas taught in Romans, but how can I square up in my mind the teachings of James\nin conjunction with the lukewarm Christian being 'spat-out'\n\nCan anyone help me, this really bothers me.\n\nIn Christ,\nWill

You ask where we are.  I would echo that question.  I'm not trying to be\ncontentious.  But assuming that the Pope has universal jurisdiction\nand authority, what authority do you rely upon for your decisions?\nWhat prevents me from choosing ANY doctrine I like and saying that\nPapal disagreement is an error that will be resolved in time?\nThis is especially true, since Councils of Bishops have basically\nstood by the Pope.\n\nIt appears that much of what lies at the heart of this matter is\ndisagreements over what is tradition and Tradition, and also over\nauthority and discipline.  \n\nMy question to the supporters of SSPX is this:\n\n  Is there ANY way that your positions with respect to church reforms\n  could change and be conformed to those of the Pope? (assuming that\n  the Pope's position does not change and that the leaders of SSPX\n  don't jointly make such  choice.)\n\nIf not, this appears to be claiming infallible teaching authority.\nIf I adopt the view that "I'm NOT wrong, I CAN'T be wrong, and\nthere's NO WAY I'll change my mind, YOU must change yours", that\nI've either left the Catholic Church or it has left me.\n\nThe Orthodox Church does not recognize papal authority/jurisdiction\nviewing authority as present in each bishop, and in Ecumenical\nCouncils.  We regard the subsequent development of the doctrines \nregarding papal authority and jurisdiction to be a separation of\nthe Bishop of Rome from the Orthodox church.  Without going into\nthe merits of the Great Schism, at least the Orthodox agree that\na split occurred, and don't paly what appear to be semantic games\nlike "He's the Pope, but we don't recognize that what he does\nis effective...".  Words aside, it appears to be a de facto split.\n\n\nWe sould argue from now until the Second Coming about what the "real"\ntraditional teaching of the Church is.  If this were a simple matter\nEast and West would not have been separated for over 900 years.\n \n\nI thought that the teaching magisterieum of the church did not allow\nerror in teachings regarding faith and morals even in the short term.`\nI may be wrong here, I'm not Roman Catholic. :-)\n\nWhat would be the effect of a Pope making an ex cathedra statement\nregarding the SSPX situation?  Would it be honored?  If not, how\ndo you get around the formal doctrine of infallibility?\nAgain, I'm not trying to be contentions, I'm trying to understand.\nSince I'm Orthodox, I've got no real vested interest in the outcome,\none way or the other.\n\n\nIt does if the command was legitimate.  SSPX does not view the\nPope's commands as legitimate.  Why?  This is a VERY slippery slope.\n \n\nTrue enough.\n\n\nOne could argue that they are establishing a non-geographic jurisdiction.\nI don't know if that's even a concept or problem in Catholic circles.\n \nLarry Overacker (llo@shell.com)\n--
_MY ADVOCATE_\n\nI sinned. And straightway, posthaste, Satan flew\nBefore the presence of the Most High God\nAnd made a railing accusation there.\nHe said, "This soul, this thing of clay and sod,\nHas sinned. 'Tis true that he has named Thy name;\nBut I demand his death, for Thou hast said,\n'The soul that sinneth, it shall die.' Shall not\nThy sentence be fulfilled? Is justice dead?\nSend now this wretched sinner to his doom!\nWhat other thing can righteous ruler do?"\nThus Satan did accuse me day and night;\nAnd every word he spoke, O  God, was true!\n\nThen quickly One rose up from God's right hand,\nBefore whose glory angels veiled their eyes;\nHe spoke, "Each jot and tittle of the law\nMust be fulfilled; the guilty sinner dies!\nBut wait -- suppose his guilt were all transferred\nTo Me and that I paid his penalty!\nBehold My hands, My side, My feet! One day\nI was made sin for him and died that he\nMight be presented, faultless, at Thy throne!"\nAnd Satan flew away.

Hello everyone.\n\nLast week I posted a similar question to alt.wedding.  Now I come in\nsearch of a deeper-level answer.\n\nMy fiance is Lutheran and I am Catholic.  We plan on getting married in\nher church because she is living there now and I plan on moving there\nin a month or so.  I called my Catholic priest to find out what I needed\nto do in order for the marriage to be recognized by my church.\n\nNeedless to say that I have found that there is no "hard and fast" rule\nwhen it comes to how the Catholic law for interfaith weddings is interpreted.\nBut I'm pretty sure that we CAN get married without too much problem; the\ntrick lies in the letter of dispensation.\n\nBut that is not why I am here....\n\nWhat I'd like to know is: \n  What are the main differences between the Lutheran and Catholic religions?\n  My priest mumbled something about how the Eucharist was understood...\n  I have heard that if two religions combine soon, it would be these two.\n\nAny help would be appreciated...\n\nThanks so much!\n\nBill\n-- \n  Bill Burns  [ Internet: wdburns@mtu.edu ]  Mac Network System Administrator\n              [ AppleLink: SHADOW         ]  Apple Student Rep, MTU\nFirst we must band together as friends,\n     then mearcilessly crush our enemies into paste.
Terms are being used in a loaded way here.\n\n"Logical proof" is an extremely messy thing to apply to real\nlife. If you think otherwise, try to construct a proof that\nyesterday happened. Obviously it did; anyone old enough to be\nreading this was there for it and remembers that it happened.\nBut *proof*? A proof starts with axioms and goes somewhere.\nYou need axioms to talk about logical proof. You can say that\nyou remember yesterday, and that you take as axiom that anything\nyou clearly remember happened. I could counterclaim that you\nhallucinated the whole thing.\n\nTo talk about proofs of historical events, you have to relax the\nterms a bit. You can show evidences, not proofs. Evidences of the\nresurrected Jesus exist. Proofs do not.

Good heavens, you mean my good friend Wes Collins, who took his wife and two \nsmall children into the jungles of Guatemala, despite dangers from primitive \nconditions and armed guerillas, so that the indigenous people groups their \ncould have the Bible in their native languages--the young man who led Bible \nstudies in our church, who daily demonstrated and declared his deep abiding \nfaith in the Lord of Love--you mean he really was a sneaky imperialistic *SPY* \nwhose _real_ reason for going was to exploit and oppress the ignorant and \nunsuspecting masses?  Imagine my surprise!  I never would have thought it of \nhim.\n\nHow was this terrible deceit discovered?  What exactly was the "cultural \ninterference" they were caught committing?  Attempting to persuade the locals \nthat their ancestral gods were false gods, and their sacrifices (including \nhuman sacrifices in some cases) were vain?  Destroying traditional lifestyles \nby introducing steel tools, medical vaccines, and durable clothes?  Oh and by \nthe way, who did the denouncing?\n\nI am terribly shocked to hear that my friend Wes, who seemed so nice, was \nreally such a deceitful tool of the devil.  Please provide me with specific \ndocumentation on this charge.  There is some risk that I may not believe it \notherwise.
I've seen this verse used to back up this idea:\n\n"...He has also set eternity in the hearts of men..."  (Ecclesiastes 3:11)
<...more accusations about a worldwide conspiracy against blacks.>\n\nSince Jesus was born in the Middle East, then I expect his human\nfeatures to be similar to Middle Easterners at that point in time.\nAnd since the camera wasn't invented yet we can only guess what \nhe looked like. For example, with all the dinosaur bones we're\ndigging up we still don't know if they were yellow-polka-dotted,\nor purplish-orange 8-). Likewise, I don't think anybody has a \npicture of Jesus (is there ? 8-) ) So our current image of \nJesus is our best guess.\n\nOkay. So let's assume that Jesus is black. Would that make you\nfollow His techings ? Cause if you follow His teachings, skin \ncolor becomes a moot point, anyway. What counts more in your\nlife ? Your faith in Jesus or His skin color (as a human) ?\n\nIn the interest of historical accuracy, however, since Jesus\nwas from Israel wouldn't His skin color be like any other Jew ?\ni.e. fair-skinned ? Although probably heavily tanned from the\ndesert sun ? Experts in this area speak up !!! cause I'm not. 8-)\n\n\n\n--

I'll pose a question here that's got me thinking:  what distinguishes\n"true" religion from cults (I'm speaking generally here, not specifially\nabout Christianity)?  Jerry Falwell was on Good Morning America on \nTuesday ostensibly to answer this question.  Basically, he said that\ntrue religion follows a message whereas a cult follows a person.\nBut, then, Christianity is a cult because the message of Christianity\nIS the person of Jesus.  So what distinguishes, for example, the\nBranch Davidian "cult" from the Presbyterian "church"?  Doctrinal\ndifferences don't answer the question, IMHO, so don't use them as\nan answer.\n\n  -- Scott at Brandeis\n\n	"But God demonstrates His     "The Lord bless you, and keep you;\n	 own love for us, in that      the Lord make His face shine on you,\n	 while we were yet sinners,    and be gracious to you;\n	 Christ died for us."	       the Lord lift up His countenance on you,\n				       and give you peace."\n		-- Romans 5:8 [NASB]		-- Numbers 6:24-26 [NASB]
There is another way to view this.  The True Celebration is Easter,\nthe Resurrection of Our Lord.  This has been true from the foundation\nof the world.  Pagan practices are then either:\n\n1. foreshadowings of the True Celebration of the Resurrection, \n   in which dim light was shone forth so that people would\n   recognize the full truth when it was manifested, OR\n\n2. satanic counterfeits intended to deceive us so that we would not\n   recognize the truth when it was manifested.\n\nI don't believe the second argument, because I believe in the power\nof the Resurrection, the fulfillment of the Incarnation, and our hope.\nEarlier or parallel ideas in other religions clearly are dim images of\nthe truth of the Resurrection.  As Paul states, we see through a glass\ndarkly.  So do others.  It serves no purpose arguing about who has\nthe darker or lighter glass.  The foreshadowings are not perfect.\nSo what? Our understnding of God is today imperfect, for we are not\nyet perfected.  Theosis is not a gift such that WHAM, we're perfect.\n\nLarry Overacker (llo@shell.com)\n--
If you agree that good works have a role somewhere, you will \ngenerally find yourself in one of two camps: \n\n   (1) Faith + Works --> Salvation\nor (2) Faith --> Salvation + Works\n\nEither (1) works are required for salvation, or (2) faith will \ninevitably result in good works. \n\nI am also of the opinion that salvation is by faith alone, based on\nEphesians 2 and Romans 3:21-31.  I also conclude that James 2, when \nread in context, is teaching bullet (2) above. When James speaks of \njustification, I would claim that he is not speaking of God declaring\nthe believing sinner innocent in His sight (Paul's use of the word). \nInstead he is speaking of the sinner's profession of faith being \n"justified" or "proven" by the display of good works. Also according \nto James 2, the abscence of such works is evidence for a "dead" or \n"useless" faith which fails to save.\n\nJames 2 is not a problem for the doctrine of salvation by faith if it\nis teaching (2).  Works would have their place, not as merit toward \nsalvation, but as evidence of true faith. \n\nRegards,\n\n---\nDave Weaver               | "He is no fool who gives what he cannot keep to\nweaver@chdasic.sps.mot.com|  gain what he cannot lose." - Jim Elliot (1949)\n\n[There are of course a number of other possibilities.

I am a good Catholic boy. A convert no less, attracted by the\nrational tradition [Aquinas et al] and the emotional authenticity\n[in comp. with the faddishness of Anglicanism] to Roman Catholicism. I\nnever had much time for the pope - or any other heirarchs - but I did, and\ndo, believe in the sacremental system. I always felt quite happy to\nlook down my nose at those such as John Emery [a few posts back] who\nhad to engage in circuitous textual arguments to prove their faith, entirely\noblivious to the fact that a dozen other faiths can do the same [with\nmiracles too], and that since their arguments depend on the belief in the\nBible as God's sole revelation, it was not very good logic to argue\nthat the Bible proved God. No, I was happy to accept the CHURCH as God's\nrevelation. It was the Church after all that existed before the Bible, the\nChurch that choose [under grace of course] the canon of scripture. Protestant\nludicrosity, I thought, was shown by Protestants breathtaking acceptance\nof Luther's right to reject a dozen or so books he disliked.\n	But recently I read Peter Brown's _Body and Society_. It is very\nwell researched, and well written. But is raises some very upsetting\nquestions. The early Christians were weird - even more so than today's\ncarzy fundies. They had odd views on sex, odder views on the body, \ntotally ludicrous views about demons, and distinctly uncharitable\nviews about other human beings. \n	now the question is this: were the first Christians just as\nweird, but we've got used to them, or did the pristine "Fall of the\nChurch" happen within one generation. It certainly did'nt have to\nwait until the Triumph of the Church under Constantine. If so,\nwha does  this say about God's promise to always support the Church.\nIt's no use throwing the usual Protestant pieties about the Church\nnot being an organization at me. It's a community or it is nothing,\nand it was the early communities that were weird. The institional\nchurch was a model of sanity by comparison.\n	I would be interested in serious Catholic and Orthodox responses to\nthis entirely serious issue. I'm not sure it is an issue for Protestants\nwith their "soul alone with Jesus" approach, but for we who see the\n"ecclesia" as a "koinoia" over time and space, the weird early\nChristians are a problem.\n\n[This is an exaggeration of the Protestant view.  Many Protestants\nhave a strong appreciation for the role of the Church.  "The soul\nalone with God" is certainly important for Protestants, but it's by no\nmeans the whole story.\n\nI have read the sort of history you talk about.  As you point out,\nProtestants don't have quite the same problem you do, because we\nbelieve that the church had a Fall at some point.  However Protestant\nmythology typically places the Fall around the time of Constantine (or\nmore likely, regard it as happening in a sort of cumulative fashion,\nstarting from Constantine but getting worse as the Pope accumulated\npower during the medieval period.)  The consequences of having it\nearlier are somewhat worrisome even to us.  Most Protestants accept\nthe theological results of the early ecumenical councils, including\nsuch items as the Trinity and Incarnation.  Indeed in the works of\nReformers such as Luther and Calvin, you'll find Church Fathers such\nas Augustine quoted all the time.  I think you'll find many\nProtestants resistant to the idea that the Early Church as a whole was\n"wierd".  (There is an additional problem for Protestants that I don't\nmuch want to talk about in this context, since it's been looked at\nrecently -- that's the question of whether one can really think of\nAugustine and other Fathers as being proto-Protestants.  Their views\non Mary, the authority of the Pope, etc, are not entirely congenial to\nProtestant thought.)\n\nOne thing that somewhat worries me is a question of methodology.\nThere are certainly plenty of wierd people in the early church.  What\nconcerns me is that they may be overrepresented in what we see.  We\nsee every Christian who courted martyrdom.  But I think there's good\nreason to believe that most ordinary Christians were more prudent than\nthat.  We see the heroic virgins.  But I think there's good reason to\nthink that many Christians were happily married.  I can't help\nsuspecting that the early church had the same range of wierdos and\nsane people that we do now.  I think there's also a certain level of\n"revisionism" active in history at the moment.  I don't mean that\nthey're manufacturing things out of whole cloth.  But don't you think\nthere might be a tendency to emphasize the novel?
I agree with Carol here.  Determining absolutes is, practically speaking, a\nwaste of time.  And we easily forget that relative truth is, in fact relative.\n\nFor example, I recently was asking some children the question "What temperature\ndoes water boil at?"  I got the answer 212 degrees consistently.  I asked\nif they knew what scale, and was told "It's just 212 degrees.  Any scale.\nThat's what all thermometers say."  Well, that's sincere, and may be\ntrue in the experience of the speaker, but it is simply wrong.  IT is NOT\nan absolute truth.  Similarly, Scripture is full of Truth, which we should\nnurture and cherish, but trying to determine which parts are Absolute Truth\nand which parts are the manifestations of that in the context of the time\nand culture in which the text was penned is missing the point.  Then religion\neasily becomes an intellectual head-trip, devoid of the living experience of \nthe indwelling Trinity and becomes dead scholasticism, IMO.\n \n[example of head-covering in Church deleted]\n\nThis was a good example.  There may be an Absolute Truth behind the\nwriting, but the simplest understanding of the passage is that the\ninstructions apply to the Corinthians, and not necessarily elsewhere.\nThe instructions may reflect Absolute Truth in the context of first\ncentury culture and the particular climate at Corinth, which was having\na LOT of trouble with order. Is it Absolute Truth to me?  No.  And I \nsee no compelling, or even reasonable, reason that it should be.\n \n\nEven the most die-hard literalists do not take all of the Bible literally.\nI've yet to meet anyone who takes the verse "blessed is he who takes your\nbabies and smashes their heads against the rocks" literally.  The Bible\nwas not printed or handed to us by God with color codings to tell us\nwhat parts should be interpreted which way. \n \n\nI agree.  Very few.  And even if we knew them, personally, we may not be \nable to express that in a way that still conveys Absolute Truth to another.\nThe presence of absence of Absolutes may not make any difference, since I\nknow I can never fully apprehend an Absolute if it walks up and greets me.\n\nI can't prove the existence of absolutes.  I can only rely upon MY experience.\nI also trust God's revelation that WE cannot fully comprehend the infinite.\nTherefore we can't comprehend the Absolutes.  So I don't need them.  \nI can never know the essence of God, only the energies by and through which\nGod is manifested to God's creation.  So the reality can be that there ARE\nabsolutes, but it is of no practical importance.  It's like claiming that the\noriginal scriptural autographs were perfect, but copies may not be.  Swell.\nWho cares?  It doesn't affect me in any practical useful way.  I might as \nwell believe that God has made a lot of electric blue chickens, and that they\nlive on Mars.  Maybe God did.  So what? Is that going to have ANY effect on \nhow I deal with my neighbor, or God?  Whether or not I go to this or that\ncafeteria for lunch?  No.  \n\nThis attitude leads many non-Christians to believe that ALL Christians\nare arrogant idiots incapable of critical reasoning.  Christianity is true,\nwonderful and sensible.  It appeals to Reason, since Reason is an inner\nreflection of the Logos of God.  Explanations that violate that simply\nappear to be insecure authoritarian responses to a complex world.\n\nNOTE:  I'm NOT claiming there is no place for authority. That'd be silly.\n       There IS a world of difference between authoritative and authoritarian.\n       Authoritative is en expression of authority that respects others.\n       Authoritarian is en expression of authority that fails to do that,\n       and is generally agressive.  Good parents (like God) are authoritative.\n       Many Christians are simply authoritarian, and, not surprisingly, few \n       adults respond to this treatment.\n\nLarry Overacker (llo@shell.com)\n--
Some years ago an Anglican synod was discussing the marriage canons and \nthere was some debate on what actually constituted a marriage.\n\nThe bishop of Natal, whose wife of many years had died, and who had recently \nremarried, announced "It MUST be consummated" and looked like that cat that \ngot the cream.\n\nSo I suppose he at least would agree with you.
<<Posting deleted.  The moderator replies:\n\nThat is generally accuate, but contains one serious error.  We Catholics\ndo believe that God's revealed truth that is not explicitly recorded in\nthe Bible can be and is passed on through the Tradition of the Church.\nIt should be noted that the Tradition of the Church, otherwise known as\nSacred Tradition, is not the same as ordinary human traditions.\nHowever, we do not believe that additional truth will be revealed to\nthe Church.  Public revelation, which is the basis of Catholic doctrine,\nended with the death of St. John, the last Apostle.  Nothing new can\nbe added.  Theologians study this revelation and can draw out implications\nthat were not recognized previously, so that the Council of Nicea could\ndefine statements about the theology of the Trinity and the Incarnation\nthat were not explicitly stated in the Bible and had been disputed\nbefore the council, but there was no new revelation at Nicea or at\nany subsequent council.\n\nCardinal Newman's _An Essay on the Development of Christian Doctrine_,\nwritten while he was still an Anglican, is an excellent discussion of\nof this point.  It was recently reprinted as a Doubleday Image Books\npaperback with some related shorter works under the title _Conscience,\nConsensus, and the Development of Doctrine_.\n-------\nMarty Helgesen\nBitnet: mnhcc@cunyvm   Internet: mnhcc@cunyvm.cuny.edu

Not if they are unwilling to go through a public marriage ceremony,\nnor if they say they are willing but have not actually done so.\n\nLet's distinguish _real_ logistical problems (like being stranded on a\ndesert island) from _excuses_ (such as waiting for so-and-so's brother\nto come back from being in the army so he can be in the ceremony)...
This is one of the differences between OT prophecy and NT prophecy.  In the\nNT, it is expected that when believers gather,\n  - people will prophesy\n  - the prophecy must be judged (1 Cor 14:29)\nThere is nothing about killing someone who makes a mistake.\n\n\nScripture is scripture; there is no "gift of scripture".  And I don't know\nabout you, but I know that _I_ have made mistakes while filled with the\nspirit.  If you don't give grace to allow people to make mistakes, they\nwill never grow in the use of the spiritual gifts!\n\nWhen we minister in my small group, I encourage people to speak out any\nimpressions or images they think might be from the Lord.  Only by trying\nwill they know whether they were right or wrong -- and in either case,\nthey'll have a better handle on it the next time.\n\nDidn't you fall when you were learning to ride a bicycle?  But you kept on\ntrying, and you learned both from your failures and your successes.\nSpiritual gifts are no different -- you get better with experience.\n\n\nThe canon of Scripture is complete.  Does this mean that God no longer\nspeaks?  I have heard his voice -- not audibly (though some have), but\nclearly nonetheless.  Is what I heard equivalent to Scripture?  No.  I have\nnever heard contemporary prophets claim that what they receive from the\nLord is on the same level as Scripture; on the contrary, those who are\nmature obey the Scriptures by submitting their prophecies to fellow\nbelievers for judgement.  And the most reliable yardstick for judging\nprophecies is, certainly, the Scriptures themselves.  The canon is closed\n-- but God is not silent!\n\n\nDoes it matter what it is called?  The question is not how to label it, but\nhow to receive it.  Words of knowledge, incidentally, are similar to\nprophecy (and sometimes the two overlap), but generally it is supernatural\nknowledge of some fact that could not be known otherwise.
Here are some notes about what the church is to be like and some helpful\nideas about how to choose a church:\n\nColossians 1:15-18\n   A.  Jesus is the head of the body, the church\n   B.  You cannot say "yes" to Jesus, but "no" to the church\n\nEphesians 2:19-22\n   A.  The church is the family of God\n   B.  The church is based on the Word of God only\n          Cornerstone=Christ\n          Foundation= Apostles=New Testament\n                      Prophets=Old Testament  (see Revelation 21:9-14)\n\n1 Corinthians 12:12-13\n   A.  Baptism is when we become a member of the church\n\nAs for the question of denominations:\n   A.  The Bible teaches that there is only ONE church from Ephesians\n4:4-6, Romans 12:4-5, 1 Corinthians 12:12-13\n   B.  1 Corinthians 1:10-13 says that there should be no divisions in\nthe church.  There should be no following of personalities in the church\n(and in time, their writings)\n   C.  There are so many churches today because of a problem.  2 Timothy\n4:1-4 says that people will turn away from the truth and try to find a\nchurch that teaches a doctrine that suits their lifestyle\n\nHebrews 10:24-25\n   A.  Do not miss church\n   B.  Purpose is to encourage each other, so we will remain faithful.\nInvolved on a relationship level in the church\n   C.  Must come to ALL services\n\nAnother verse which is helpful is Hebrews 3:12-15.  The church should be\nencouraging daily, as it is their duty to do.\n\nOf course, more standards apply:\n   1 Timothy 4:16  People in the church should be watching their lives\nand doctrines to make sure they both live up to the Word entirely (ie,\ndisciples).\n   Acts 17:10-12  The pastor does not come close to the Apostle Paul\n(natural conclusion since the Apostle Paul talked with Jesus directly\nface to face), so if the Bereans, who were considered noble, didn't take\nPaul at his word but checked out what he said with Scripture to verify\nhis statements, then church members are to do the same and verify the\npastor's statements.  If they are not verifiable or valid in light of\nother verses, then that group should be avoided as a church (would've\nmade a wonderful suggestion to the Waco group, especially in light of\nMatthew 24).
I heard the same thing, but without confirmation that he actually said it.\nIt was just as alarming to us as to you; the Bible says that nobody knows\nwhen the second coming will take place.
Someone writing anonymously asks:\n\n\nI *did* become a Christian without having been indoctrinated by my parents, and\nhaving studied Buddhism fairly carefully and other religions to a lesser\ndegree.  I made a decision to accept the truth-claims of Christianity after\nhaving given it a lot of thought.  (I have to point out that the process was not\npurely a cold, rational one: there was a powerful experiential element as well.\nAlso, my Calvinist should rest assured that I don't lay any of the\nresponsibility for the outcome [my conversion] on anyone but God.)\n\nIt took me years and years for this all to happen, because I had many of the\nobjections that this poster puts forward.  I grew up in the shadow of [generic\nauthoritarian conservative denomination], and I *knew* that that wasn't a way\nof life that I could adopt.  But I gradually learned not to tar all of\nChristianity with the same brush, and realized quite suddenly one cold winter\nnight that I accepted what I had heretofore rejected.  I am quite certain that\nI was not "brain-washed".
Julie, it is a really trying situation that you have described.  My\nbrother was living with someone like that and things were almost as bad\n(although he left after a considerably shorter amount of time due to\nother problems with the relationship).  Anyway, the best thing to do\nwould be to get everyone in the same room together (optimally in a room\nwith nothing breakable), lock the door behind you, throw the key out\nunderneath the door (just as far as the longest hand can reach.  You\nwould like to get out after the conclusion, I would imagine), and hash\nthings out.  More than likely, there will be screaming, crying, and\npossibly hitting (unless of course someone decided to bring some rope to\ntie people down).  Some of the best strategies in keeping things calmer\nwould include:\n   have each individual own their own statements (ie, I feel that this\nrelationship is hurting everyone involved because.... or I really don't\nunderstand where you're coming from.)\n   reinforce statements by paraphrasing, etc. (ie, So you think that we\ndid this because of...?  Well, let me just say that the reason for this\nwas ....)\n   don't accuse each other (It was your fault that ... happened!)\n   find a common ground about SOMETHING (Lampshades really are\ndecorational and functional at the same time.)\n   Guaranteed, in a situation like this, there is going to be some\ngunnysacking (re-hashing topics which were assumed resolved, but were\ntruly not and someone feels someone else is to blame).  However, this\nshould be kept to a minimum and simply ask for forgiveness or apologize\nabout each situation WITHOUT holding a smoldering grudge.  \n\nThe relationship really can work.  It's just a matter of keeping things\nsmooth and even.  It's sort of like making a peace treaty between\nwarring factions:  you can't give one side everything; there must be a\ncompromise.  Breaks can be taken, but communication between everyone\ninvolved must continue if the relationships here are to survive.
>[I'm sort of mystified about how a Christian might respond to this.]\n\n  I'll start with a parable.\n \n  A Christian woman hires a carpenter to build her a birdhouse.  When he comes\nover, they begin talking about religion.  "So you believe that you understand\nGod?" he asks.  "Yes, I do," she replies.  "Then have him build you the \nbirdhouse."
[it has to do with honoring the laws of the state, and]\n\nI would go further: if a couple are unwilling to have their commitment\npublicly witnessed and recorded, that's prima facie evidence that the\ncommitment isn't really there.
Actually I don't think there is any conflict if we really understand\nwhat these passages say.  First, what is faith?  If you study the \nmeaning of the Greek and Hebrew words so translated I think you will\ncome to the conclusion that the word means a *lot* more than mere \nbelief.  Faith means both trust and action.  If you do not put your \nbelief into action it simply cannot qualify as faith.  I think this \nis what James means when he says that "faith without works is dead" \nand, "I will show you my faith by my works."  Remember James was \nwriting to "the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad."  This \nprobably means he was writing to those who would hear the gospel much \nlater and wouldn't understand the meaning of the original Greek.\n(Indeed I suspect James was writing to us, today, among others he\nintended to reach.)  Paul, on the other hand wrote mostly to the\npeople of the Roman empire who generally understood the meaning of\nthe Greek.\n\nAnother key to why there is no conflict is to look at Paul's\nstatements in their context.  I think you will find that when Paul\ncontrasts faith and works it is in the context of comparing the\ngospel with the Law, meaning the Law of Moses.  This was the great\nburden of Paul's life.  As the apostle to the Gentiles he would go\nconvert a bunch of people, then the "Judizers" would come along and\ntry to convince them that they also had to obey the Law of Moses (cf\nActs chapter 15).  In this context Paul condemns the idea of being\nsaved by the works of the Law, saying that we are saved by the blood\nof Jesus and our faith in him.  I believe that a better translation\nfor today would be that we are saved by *faithfulness*.  I think\n"faithfulness" today has a meaning closer to what the original\nwriters intended.\n\n\nI think you misunderstand Romans.  What Paul is really saying is\nthat God prefers a faithful Gentile who does not "keep kosher" to a\nkosher Jew who fails to stay faithful in the more important matters\nof following the Lord and having charity toward his fellows.\n\n\nIn the sense of faith described above, you cannot have real faith and \nbe lukewarm.  If you know God but are lukewarm (unfaithful), you are \nworse off than the person who never heard of Him.  Remember, Jesus in\nthe parable of the pearl of great price (Mat 13:45-46) and again in\nthe one on the treasure hidden in the field (Mat 13:44) indicates that\nthe price of the Kingdom of God is *all* we have.\n\n[I agree with you in general, including the fact that "pistis" has\nsome of the force of "faithful".  However if you take that too far,\nyou can end up with something that Paul definitely would not have\nintended.  Being faithful means following God in all things.  To say\nthat we are saved by being faithful is very close to saying that we\nare saved by commiting no sins.  I assume that's not what you meant.\n\nI have almost given up on finding a specific verbal formula that\ncompletely captures this.  However I think Paul is describing what I'd\ncall a basic orientation, including aspects such as trust and\ncommitment.  Jesus speaks of it as rebirth, which implies a basic\nchange.  We may still do things that are sinful, and may fail to show\nthe new life in Christ in many situations where we should.  But in any\nChristian there had better be the basic change in orientation that\nJesus calls being born again.
It just goes to show that not all evangelical fundamentalists are pharisitical!\nI wear a black leather jacket, like classic rock, but no longer have the long\nlocks I once had.  However,  I too rely upon the Bible as a basis for Christian\nethics.
Mark Ashley's account of private revelation does not, as some might\nthink, contradict my posting in which I said that the Catholic Church\nbelieves that public revelation, on which Catholic doctrine is based,\nended with the death of St. John, the last Apostle.  In that posting\nI made sure I used the word "public".  Public revelation contains\nGod's truth intended for everyone to believe.  The revelation contained\nin the Bible is a significant subset of public revelation.  Private\nrevelation is revelation that God gives to an individual.  He may speak\ndirectly to the individual, He may send an angel, or He may send the\nVirgin Mary or some lesser saint.  The only person who is required to\nbelieve a private revelation is the person to whom it is revealed.\nDevotional practices may be based on reported private revelations,\nbut doctrines can not.\n\nWhen an alleged private revelation attracts sufficient attention, the\nChurch may investigate it.  If the investigation indicates a likelihood\nthat the alleged private revelation is in fact from God, it will be\napproved.  That means that it can be preached in the Church.  However,\nit is still true that no one is required to believe that it came from\nGod.  A Catholic is free to deny the authenticity of even the most\nwell attested and strongly approved private revelations, such as those\nat Fatima and Lourdes.  (I suspect that few if any Catholics do reject\nFatima and Lourdes, but if any do their rejection of them does not\nmean they are not orthodox Catholics in good standing.)\n\nI do not have at hand a list of the criteria the Church uses in\nevaluating an alleged private revelation--it's not something I need\nevery day--but I know that one of the primary requirements is that\nnothing in the alleged private revelation can contradict anything\nknown through public revelation\n-------\nMarty Helgesen\nBitnet: mnhcc@cunyvm   Internet: mnhcc@cunyvm.cuny.edu
My, my, my.  I knew that I would receive a response to my post, but not\nTHIS extensive.  Thank you to all who responded; it at least showed that\npeople were willing to think about it, even though the general response was\na return to the same old "Why should it matter?" question.  To those of you\nwho were a part of this response, I suggest that you read the articles\ncovering this same question in soc.culture.african.american, for you are in\nDIRE need of some cultural enlightenment.\n\nHasta luego
Yes, I do agree with your definition.  My use of the term "always" is\nrather deceptive, I admit.  \n \n\nHold it.  I said that all of scripture is true.  However, discerning\nexactly what Jesus, Paul and company were trying to say is not always so\neasy.  I don't believe that Paul was trying to say that all women should\nbehave that way.  Rather, he was trying to say that under the circumstances\nat the time, the women he was speaking to would best avoid volubility and\ncover their heads.  This has to do with maintaining a proper witness toward\nothers.  Remember that any number of relativistic statements can be derived\nfrom absolutes.  For instance, it is absolutely right for Christians to\nstrive for peace.  However, this does not rule out trying to maintain world\npeace by resorting to violence on occasion.  (Yes, my opinion.)\n \n\nSure.  The Bible preaches absolute truths.  However, exactly what those\ntruths are is sometimes a matter of confusion.  As I said, the Bible does\npreach absolute truths.  Sometimes those fundamental principles are crystal\nclear (at least to evangelicals).  Sometimes they are not so clear to\neveryone (e.g. should baptism be by full immersion or not, etc).  That is\nlargely because sometimes, it is not explicitly spelled out whether the writers\nare speaking to a particular culture or to Christianity as a whole.  This is \nwhere scholarship and the study of Biblical contexts comes in.  \n \n\nGod revealed his Truths to the world, through His Word.  It is utterly \nunavoidable, however, that some people whill come up with alternate \ninterpretations.  Practically anything can be misinterpreted, especially\nwhen it comes to matters of right and wrong.  Care to deny that?
Of course if this question was asked in a group dealing with economics,\nthe answer would be that the cause of war was economic. My observations\nover the past 30 years (and not withstanding a little history reading\nbeside) is that while religious differences do play a part in many of\nthe conflicts, so does (unfortunately) race, economics and any other\nitems that identify one group of men as being different from another.\n\nIf we want to couch the cause of conflict in Christian terms, I would\nput it while Christ died for our sins, we are yet sinners. While some\nindividuals assume "Christlike" natures, most of us do not even\ncome close.\n\nI realize that in many ways this is a trite answer, but I guess that\nit is my way of rationalizing man's constant (or so it seems)\nconflict.\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------
Hello,\n\nI'm writing a paper on the role of the catholic church in Poland after 1989. \nCan anyone tell me more about this, or fill me in on recent books/articles(\nin english, german or french).

Hey...\n\nI may be wrong, but wasn't Jeff Fenholt part of Black Sabbath?  He's a\nMAJOR brother in Christ now.  He totally changed his life around, and\nhe and his wife go on tours singing, witnessing, and spreading the\ngospel for Christ.  I may be wrong about Black Sabbath, but I know he\nwas in a similar band if it wasn't that particular group...\n\nHOW GREAT IS TH LOVE THE FATHER HAS LAVISHED ON US, THAT WE SHOULD BE\nCALLED CHILDREN OF GOD!

Hi...\n\nI'm new to this group, and maybe this has been covered already,\nbut does anybody out there see the current emphasis on the\nenvironment being turned (unintentionally, of course) into\npantheism?\n\nI've debated this quite a bit, and while I think a legitimate\nconcern for the planet is a great thing, I can easily see it\nbeing perverted into something dangerous.\n\nAs evidence, may I quote THE WALL STREET JOURNAL (of all\nthings!), April 2 (Editorial page):\n"We suspect that's because one party to the (environmental)\ndispute thinks the Earth is sanctified.  It's clear that much\nof the environmentalist energy is derived from what has been\ncalled the Religious Left, a SECULAR, or even PAGAN fanaticism\nthat now WORSHIPS such GODS as nature and gender with a\nreverence formerly accorded real religions."  (EMPHASIS MINE).
So what's your point?  Mark's comment still is valid.  To suggest that\nAIDS is "deserved" IS ludicrous.  I sin.  I can resolve to abstain from \nsin, and do weekly (more often, actually).  Yet I routinely fail.\nI surely do deserve what I get, yet God compassionately provided \nthe Incarnate Logos, Jesus, as a rememdy and a way out of our situation.\nIf AIDS is deserved, I surely deserve instant death just as much, as do\nwe all, as St. Paul so cogently remids us.\n\nTo willingly judge "others" as deserving punishment seems to me\nto be the height of arrogance and lack of humility.  \n \n\nSo what's the point here?  I can get AIDS and NEVER engage in\n"deviant" sexual behavior.  In fact, I could engage in LOTS\nof deviant sexual behavior with HIV+ people and never be\ninfected.  AIDS is a consequence of particular behaviors,\nmany of which are not sexual.  And not all sexual behaviors\ncarry the risk of transmission.  \n \n\nThe end of all things is to know, love and serve God, growing\ndaily closer through prayer, meditation and discipline.  Even so\nI could get AIDS.  Anyone could, unless they remain forever celibate,\nIV-drug-free, and transfusion free.\n\nLarry Overacker (llo@shell.com)\n--
First of all, the original poster misquoted.  The reference is from 2 Tim 3:16.\nThe author was Paul, and his revelations were anything but "(at best) \nsecond-hand".\n\n	"And is came about that as [Saul] journeyed, he was approaching\n	 Damascus, and suddenly a light from heaven flashed around him; and\n	 he fell to the ground, and heard a voice saying to him, "Saul, Saul,\n	 why are you persecuting Me?"  And he said, "Who art Thou, Lord?"  And\n	 He said, "I am Jesus whom you are persecuting, . . ."\n		(Acts 9:3-5, NAS)\n\nPaul received revelation directly from the risen Jesus!  (Pretty cool, eh?)  He\nbecame closely involved with the early church, the leaders of which were \nfollowers of Jesus throughout his ministry on earth.\n\n\nI agree.  I don't believe anyone but the Spirit would be able to convince you \nthe Spirit exists.  Please don't complain about this being circular.  I know\nit is, but really, can anything of the natural world explain the supernatural?\n(This is why revelation is necessary to the authors of the Bible.)\n\n\nThe Spirit is part of God.  How much closer to the source can you get?\nThe Greek in 2 Timothy which is sometimes translated as "inspired by God", \nliterally means "God-breathed".  In other words, God spoke the actual words \ninto the scriptures.  Many theologians and Bible scholars (Dr. James Boice is \none that I can remember off-hand) get quite annoyed by the dryness and \nincompleteness of "inspired by God".\n\n\nThat's what the verse taken from 2 Timothy was all about.  The continuity of a \nbook written over a span of 1500 years by more than 40 authors from all walks \nof life is a testimony to the single authorship of God.\n\n\n\nWhat source to you claim to have discovered which has information of superior\nhistoricity to the Bible?  Certainly not Josephus' writings, or the writings \nof the Gnostics which were third century, at the earliest.\n\n\nJesus was fully God as well.  That's why I'd assert that he is wise.\n\n\nPlease rethink this last paragraph.  If there is no God, which seems to be your\ncurrent belief, then Jesus was either a liar or a complete nut because not\nonly did he assert that God exists, but he claimed to be God himself!  (regards\nto C.S. Lewis)  How then could you have the least bit of respect for Jesus?\n	In conclusion, be careful about logically unfounded hypotheses based\non gut feelings about the text and other scholars' unsubstantiated claims.  \nThe Bible pleads that we take it in its entirety or throw the whole book out.\n	About your reading of the Bible, not only does the Spirit inspire the\nwriters, but he guides the reader as well.  We cannot understand it in the \nleast without the Spirit's guidance:\n\n	"For to us God revealed them through the Spirit; for the Spirit \n	searches all things, even the depths of God."  (1 Cor 2:10, NAS)\n \nPeace and may God guide us in wisdom.\n\n+-=-+-=-+-=-+-=-+-=-+-=-+-=-+-=-+-=-+-=-+-=-+-=-+-=-+-=-+-=-+-=-+-=-+-=-+-=-+-=\nCarter C.

If babies are not supposed to be baptised then why doesn't the Bible\never say so.  It never comes right and says "Only people that know\nright from wrong or who are taught can be baptised."\n        What Christ did say was :\n\n        "I solemly assure you, NO ONE can enter God's kingdom without\n         being born of water and Spirit ... Do not be surprised that I\n         tell you you must ALL be begotten from above."\n\nCould this be because everyone is born with original sin?
I find it interesting that cls never answered any of the questions posed. \nThen he goes on the make statements which make me shudder.  He has\nestablished a two-tiered God.  One set of rules for the Jews (his people)\nand another set for the saved Gentiles (his people).  Why would God\ndiscriminate?  Does the Jew who accepts Jesus now have to live under the\nGentile rules.\n\nGod has one set of rules for all his people.  Paul was never against the\nlaw.  In fact he says repeatedly that faith establishes rather that annuls\nthe law.  Paul's point is germane to both Jews and Greeks.  The Law can\nnever be used as an instrument of salvation.  And please do not combine\nthe ceremonial and moral laws in one.\n\nIn Matt 5:14-19 Christ plainly says what He came to do and you say He was\nonly saying that for the Jews's benefit.  Your Christ must be a\npolitician, speaking from both sides of His mouth.  As Paul said, "I have\nnot so learned Christ."  Forget all the theology, just do what Jesus says.\n Your excuses will not hold up in a court of law on earth, far less in\nGod's judgement hall.
I don't know if this is the sort of thing you guys like\nto discuss.  I guess it falls into the area of apologetics.\n\nThis is a question that seems to pop up now and again in\nconversations with non-christians.

After all if our religion is all about\npeace and love why have there been so many religious wars?\n  Personally I am of the view that religion has often been\nused as an excuse to instigate wars often to disguise\nnational ambitions but I would love to hear what anyone\nelse has to say about this subject.\n  Thanks in advance\n  Andrew J Fraser\n\n(If we're thinking in terms of history, the Crusades,\nNorthern Ireland, Yugoslavia(?) come immediately to mind)\n\nnorthern Ireland, Yugoslavia (? \n  \n-- \n=========================================================================
I'm concerned about a recent posting about WBT/SIL.  I thought they'd\npretty much been denounced as a right-wing organization involved in\nideological manipulation and cultural interference, including Vietnam\nand South America. A commission from Mexican Academia denounced them in\n1979 as " a covert political and ideological institution used by the\nU.S. govt as an instrument of control, regulation, penetration, espionage and\nrepression."\n  My concern is that this group may be seen as acceptable and even\npraiseworthy by readers of soc.religion.christian. It's important that\nChristians don't immediately accept every "Christian" organization as\nautomatically above reproach.
Can someone cite Biblical references to homosexuality being immoral, other\nthan Leviticus? So far, when I ask, around here, I get the verses from\nLeviticus spouted at me, but the whole rest of that book tends to be\nignored by Christians (haven't seen any stonings in a _long_ time :-).\n\nLater,\nMax (Bob) Muir\n\n[The list was posted not long ago, as I recall, aside from Lev, commonly\ncited passages are:\n\nthe story of Sodom.  Note however that this was a homosexual rape, and\nthere's no disagreement that that is wrong.  I take an intermediate\nposition on this: note that Sodom is referred to elsewhere in the\nBible for its sinfulness.  It doesn't seem to have been known\nspecifically for homosexuality.  Rather, I think it was considered a\ncesspool of all sins. However from what we know of Jewish attitudes,\nhomosexuality would have contributed to the horror of the action\ndescribed.  (It almost seems to have been contrived to combine about\nas many forms of evil in one act as possible: homosexual rape of\nguests, who were actually angels.)  But this story is not specifically\nabout homosexuality.\n\nIn the NT, the clear references are all from Paul's letters.  In Rom\n1, there is a passage that presupposes that homosexuality is an evil.\nNote that the passage isn't about homosexuality -- it's about\nidolatry.  Homosexuality is visited on people as a punishment, or at\nleast result, of idolatry.  There are a number of arguments over this\npassage.  It does not use the word "homosexuality", and it is referring\nto people who are by nature heterosexual practicing homosexuality.\nSo it's not what I'd call an explicit teaching against all homosexuality.\nBut it does seem to support what would be a natural assumption anyway,\nthat Paul shares the general negative Jewish attitude towards \nhomosexuality.\n\nThe other passages occur in lists of sins, in I Cor 6:9, and I Tim\n1:10.  Unfortunately it's not entirely clear what the words used here\nmean.  There have been suggestions that one has a broader meaning,\nsuch as "wanton", and that another may be specifically "male\nprostitute".  Again, we don't have here a precise teaching about\nhomosexuality, but it is at least weak supportive evidence that Paul\nshared the OT's negative judgement on homosexuality.\n\nJude 1:7 is sometimes cited, however it's probably not relevant.  The\ncontext in Jude involves angels.  Since those who were almost raped in\nSodom were angels, it seems likely that "strange flesh" refers to\nintercourse with angels.\n\nAs you can see, the NT evidence is such that people's conclusion is\ndetermined by their approach to the Bible.  Conservatives note that\nthe passages from Paul's letters imply that he accepted the OT\nprohibition.  This is enough for them to regard it as having NT\nendorsement.  Liberals note that there's no specific teaching, and no\nclear definition of what is being prohibited or why (is the concern in\nRom 1 the connection of homosexuality to pagan worship?  what exactly\ndo the words in the lists of sins mean?).  Thus some believe it is\nlegitimate to regard this as a attitude Paul took with him from his\nbackground and not a specific teaching of the Gospel.\n\nThis is an explosive topic, which tends to result in long\ndissertations on the exact meaning of various Greek words.  But it's\nclear to me that that's mostly irrelevant.  What it really comes down\nto is whether people are looking to the Bible for law or whether they\nbelieve that such as approach is inconsistent with the Gospel.  This\nappears to depend upon one's reaction to the message of the Bible as a\nwhole, as well as one's perception of the needs of the church today.\nThis is a difference of approach at least as serious as the difference\nbetween Protestant and Catholic in the 16th Cent, and one where both\nsides believe that the Bible is so obviously on their side that they\nkeep thinking all they have to do is quote a few more passages and the\nother side will finally come to their senses.  That makes things\nvery frustrating for a moderator, who realizes that such an optimistic\noutcome is not very likely...

Drugs are a replacement for Christ.  \nThose who have an empty spot in the God-shaped hole in their hearts must \ndo something to ease the pain.  This is why the most effective \nsubstance-abuse recovery programs involve meeting peoples' spiritual \nneeds.\n\nThank you, Eric for your post.  It has helped me to appreciate how much \nGod has blessed me.  I hope that you will someday have a more joy-filled \nand abundant life.
Biblical basis for the Immaculate Conception:\n\n1) "I will put enmity between you [the Serpent] and the woman, and\nbetween your seed and her seed, she [can also be read he] shall crush\nyour head and you shall bruise her [or his] heel."\n    -Genesis 3.15\n\n2) "He who commits sin is of the devil ..."\n    -1 John 3.8\n\n3) "Hail, full of grace [greek - kecharitomene], the Lord is with thee ..."\n    -Luke 1.28\n\n   From the above, we prove the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception.\n   First, God has given the proto-evangel in Genesis 3.15, which is the\nfirst promise of a savior, who will redeem mankind from the wiles of\nSatan. "[Satan] was a murderer from the beginning, and has not stood in\nthe truth because there is no truth in him." John 8.44.  Now the\nproto-evangel promises several things, enmity between Satan and "the\nwoman", and enmity between Satan and "her seed."  Now the woman is both\nEve (who is the immediate point of reference) and Mary, the second Eve. \n"Her seed" is Jesus Christ, and He is also at enmity with Satan in the\nsame way as Mary is said to be at enmity with Satan.  Thus, knowing as\nwe do that Jesus Christ is sinless (Hebrews 7.26), we can conclude that\nMary is also sinless because if she wasn't she would 1) not be at enmity\nwith the devil, as 1 John 3.8 tells us, and 2) the relation of her\nsinlessness to Christ's sinlessness would be called into question, as\nwould God's veracity.  For God promised an enmity between Mary and the\nserpent, and it is not possible for God to lie or be decieved.\n    Second, we have the Angelic Greeting where Mary is called by the\nArchangle Gabriel "full of grace."  As I pointed out above this is from\nthe Greek word "Kecharitomene" which means not just full of grace, but a\nplenitude or perfection of grace.  The sense of it is best grasped by\nthe footnote to the Jerusalem Bible, "Hail you who have been and reamin\nfilled with grace."  But that is a little to long to say, so it is\nreduced to full of grace.  And as it says, "you who have been" Mary had\nalways been filled with grace, from the moment of her conception, which\nwas also the moment of her salvation, until her death some years later.\n    It must be admitted that it is possible that God could have done\nwhat the doctrine of the Immaclute Conception says He did do.  And if\nGod could keep himself free from any contact with sin, through his\nMother, He would have, and the Bible records this fact, to which the\nFathers of the Church such as St. John Damascus, St. Augustine of Hippo\n, St. Ambrose and others are in complete agreement with, as is all of\nChristian tradition, and as is the infallible declaration of the Pope on\nthe matter in "Ineffibilus Deus."

[ Much deletion.  He is trying to explain the Immaculate Conception\nand the Assumption of Mary.]\n\n\nIf this is true than why in the Genesis story is God concerned that\nAdam and Eve might also eat from the Tree of Life and live forever and\nbe like gods?  Eating of the tree of life would not take away the\neffects of eating of the Tree of Knowledge.  Is there any reason to\nassume that they had already eaten of the Tree of Life and so had\nalready attained to eternal life?  If so, what basis is there for\nsaying that this was taken away from them?  To me the wages of sin are\na spiritual death, not necessarily a physical death.  I\ncan attest to the truth of this interpretation from my own experience.\nI suspect that many others could attest to this as well. \n\nPeace\nWill\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------
I appreciated the follow-ups and replies to my earlier query.  One reply, which\nI have lost, suggested several parishes in New York that have good Masses, one \nof which was Corpus Christi in downtown Manhattan.  By coincidence, last week's\n_America_, the national Jesuit magazine, carried an interview with Fr. Myles \nBourke, Corpus Christi's pastor emeritus.  Fr. Bourke also directed the NT \ntranslation in the New American Bible.  He noted "...certain practices have \nbeen introduced into the Mass in such a manner that an atmosphere of banality, \nand sometimes of hilarity, has trivialized the liturgy."  I note that at my \nparents' parish on Easter, helium filled balloons were distributed at the \noffertory, apparently to aid in understanding the word "risen".  This was not a \nkiddie mass, either, but the well-attended 11:00 Mass.\n\nI wanted to note the generous spirit behind the replies.  This newsgroup as a\nwhole offers generally moderate (perhaps because it's moderated) conversation\non topics that often lead people to extreme behavior (including myself).\nSometimes people do go over the top, but the remarkable thing is how that is\nthe exception, I think.  Benefits of the doubt are generally granted.  It seems\nso...Christian?
I don't know which passage you are refering to, but the passage I have\noften seen cited as an example of a mother image of God is Isaiah 49:15\n"Can a woman forget her sucking child / that she should have no \ncompassion / on the son of her womb? / Even these may forget, / \nyet I will not forget you." \n \nThis passage is *not* a mother image of God at all. The mother here\nis the image of the best human constancy can show, and it is \ncontrasted with the constancy of God. The mother figure here represents\nmankind, not God.\n-- \n==============================================================================\nMark Baker                  | "The task ... is not to cut down jungles, but \naa888@Freenet.carleton.ca   | to irrigate deserts." -- C.

Well said, Michael!\n\nThe Catholic traditon has a list of behaviours called the Spiritual \nWorks of Mercy:\n\nadmonish the sinner\ninstruct the ignorant\ncounsel the doubtful\ncomfort the sorrowful\nbear wrongs patiently\nforgive all injury\npray for the living and the dead (yes, I know there is some controversy \n                           on this and I don't want to argue about it.)\n\nThese are all things that have a direct application to usenet.

Very interesting, but I also believe that you have presented a\nmisleading argument.  Christianity is not the cause of the massacres\nand horrific injustices that you relate, rather they are the fault\nof people who misunderstand Jesus Christ's message, and modify\nit to suit their own beliefs and aims, rather than alter their\nambitions to be more in line with those presented as desirable in\nthe New Testament.  With every truthful and good message that\ncarries authority or implied authority, comes the inevitable\nfact that some (many?) people will understand it in a distorted\nway, with inevitable consequences.\n\nThe Bible's message is that we are to love all people, and\nthat all people are redeemable.  It preaches a message of\nrepentance, and of giving.  Unfortunately, all people have\ndeceitful hearts, and are capable of turning this message\naround and contorting it in sometimes unbelievable ways.\nThis is also a fundamental Christian doctrine.\n\nOne of the problems is that you look at the world through\nthe eyes of Western history.  I think that you will find\nmany, many cases of massacres that were instigated by\npeople who never claimed they were Christian.  I am not saying\nthis to justify the massacres that were, but I am merely\npointing you to a tendency which is present in humans already.\n\nConsider the world without Christianity.  I doubt that we\nwould have the same freedoms in the countries in which we\nlive, if it wasn't for the peaceful doctrines of Jesus Christ.\nPerhaps we would even be confronted by a very harsh religion\n(I won't name any here, though one comes to mind) which\nwould not even allow us the freedom of speech to debate such\nsubjects.\n\nPoint the blame at inherent human tendencies of thirst for\npower, greed and hatred.  Please don't point the blame at\na message which preaches fundamental giving and denial, in\nlove for others.\n\nYours in Christ,\n\nAndrew McVeigh\n\n\np.s. I believe that a line of questioning like you presented\nis, strangely enough, compatible with becoming a Christian.\nCertainly Christianity encourages one to question the behaviour\nof the world, and especially Christians.  I praise God for\nJesus Christ, and the fact that we can doubt our beliefs\nand still come back to God and be forgiven, time and time\nagain.\n\n--\n*****
The next time you go to church, you can check the better creed, that is,\nhave learned that on the first go around.  But what's a body without \na little bit a'soul? \n\n\nAt the risk of offending everybody, I will interject the 13th century\npoint of view.  Christ descended immediately into the bosom of Abraham\nto set captives captive.  He preached to the saved for three days before\ndrawing them with Him back to this earth.  I'm no expert on this part,\nbut Matthew (27:52-53) says about the death of Jesus: "tombs were opened,\nand the bodies of many saints who had fallen asleep were raised.  And\ncoming forth from the tombs after his resurrection, they entered the\nholy city and appeared to many."  (NAB)  Regarding the hell of the\ndamned, of which you speak, Christ did not see it (Ps 16:10, Acts 2:27),\nalthough it saw Him (cf. Is 45:2).  \n\nConcerning the abodes of the dead, I don't want to subject my brethren\nto further anguish, so I will direct you to contact me through e-mail\nif you are genuinely concerned. \n\n\nYour new body might be something like Adam's before his fateful encounter\nwith the Just One (Acts 7:52, CR trans. Vulgate): filled with infused\nknowledge, absent of concupiscence, and immortal.  It would probably be\na little glorified, too.\n\n\nI wouldn't recommend it.

Sorry to disappoint you, but I'm afraid your friendship is in danger.  \nPerhaps you should examine in yourself why as such a good friend, you \nare unwilling to accept this imortant part of your friends life?  Why \ndo you call into question his faith?  Your friend has changed, he has \nfound something that fills a need in his life.  You need to decide if \nyou are still his friend, whether you can accommodate his new life.  \nIt sounds as if you are criticizing him for a fundamental belief in \nthe Bible, yet you are quick to reveal that your fundamental belief \nthat it is superstition.  Perhaps if he knew you at least took him \nseriously, that you at least took an interest in the light he has found, \nthat you at least tried to understand what has become a special part of \nhis life, you could together decide to become fundamentalists, respect \neach others differences and remain friends, or part ways.  Maybe even if \nyou stuck it out with him, you could help him to un-convert.  Of course, \nif you go in with that attitude he will surely see through your intentions \nand begin to resent you.\n\nI happen to be a person very tolerant of fundamentalists, because I know\nthat the idea of a simple black and white approach to life is appealing.\nI don't happen to share the beliefs of fundamentalists, but I am not\noffended by their prosyletizing.  I had a few good conversations with\nsome Witnesses who came to my door.  I didn't switch my beliefs, but for\nthose at home who maybe need a friendly face to invite them somewhere,\nthe Witnesses provide a wonderful service.  You may have been conditioned\nto believe that religion is unimportant and witnessing is obnoxious, but\nwhy?  Are you afraid you might be converted and become one of them, that\nyou will be swept up in fundamentalism, that you will become a weirdo.\nFriendship's a two-way street.  You must respect your friend, ALL of him,\nincluding his beliefs, if you want the friendship to continue.
Good point.  The New Testament does not quote Ezra, Nehemiah, Esther,\nRuth, Job, Ecclesiastes, or Song of Songs, just as it does not quote\nfrom the Deuterocanon.  But if the non-quotation of the former does not\ndisqualify them, neither does the non-quotation of the later.  And the\nWisodm of Solomon was quite clearly an influence on St. Paul, especially\nin the letter to the Romans (cf especially Romans 1.18-32 and Wisdom\n13-14).\n\n[stuff deleted]\n\n \nTrue.  Not all accepted them as Scripture, though niether were all the\nbooks of the New Testament so accepted, which puts to the lie the whole\nargument of the books being excluded because they were debated and not\nuniversally accepted.  Hebrews, the Apocalypse, 2 Peter, Esther, and\nothers were debated at various times, but eventually retained.  As for\nthe Codexes you mention, both Vaticanus and Sinaitcus include the\nDeuterocanon, bothe of the New and Old Testaments, and Vaticanus (I\nthink) inlcudes 1 Clement, the Shepard of Hermas, and the Epistle of\nBaranabas.  As for the Muratorian Canon, it deals with the New Testament\nonly, though it is very valuable in its witness to those books.\n\n\n\n	You're not wrong!  It is a `tradition of men' to exlcude them, as I\nwill explain below.\n\n"That nothing be read in the Church under the nmae of Divine Scripture,\nexcept the canonical Scriptures, and the canoncial Scriptures are -\nGenesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy, Joshua, Judges, Ruth,\nFour books of Kingdoms [being 1&2 Samuel and 1&2 Kings], Two books of\nParalpomenon [being 1&2 Chronicles], Job, the Psalter of David, the Five\nbooks of Solomon [being Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Song of Songs, Wisdom of\nSolomon, and [misatributed to him] the Wisdom of Jesus son of Sirach],\nThe books of the Twelve (Minor) Prophets, Isaiah, Jeremiah [being\nJeremiah, the Lamentations, Baruch, and the Letter, all of which were\nformerly counted as one], Ezekiel, Daniel, Tobit, Judith, Esther, Two\nbooks of Ezra [being Ezra and Nehemiah], Two books of Maccabees.  And of\nthe New Testament: Four books of the Gospel, One book of the Acts of the\nApostles, Thirteen letters of Paul the Apostle, One Letter of the same\nto the Hebrews, two of Peter the Apostle, Three of John, One of the\nApostle Jude, One of the Apostle James, One book of the Apocalypse of\nJohn."\n	-Council of Hippo, Statute 36, (393 AD)\n\n	This same list was promulgated again at the Third Council of Carthage\n(397 AD), and at the Sixth Council of Carthage (419 AD) - at which\ncouncil the same list was enumerated with the words "Because we have\nrecieved from the Fathers that these are the books to be read in the\nChurch."  Which ought to quiet those who assert "in the name of Holy\nScripture we do understand those books of whose authority there was\nnever any doubt in the Church," as the Episcopal Church does in removing\nthe Deuterocanon from the realm of Scripture.  (Though the Episcopalians\nhold them in high regard and read them in the Church, they are not\ncounted as Scripture by them, and may not be used to prove dogma.  The\nLutherans hold out similarly.)\n	Earlier mention of the so-called Apocrypha as divine scripture can also\nbe found, and below I inlcude only a portion of the quotes calling it\ndivine scripture that could be found among the writings of the Fathers.\n\n"And this is the reason why the Law of the old Testament is reckoned as\nconsisting of twenty-two books: so that they may correspond to the\nnumber of letters [in the Hebrew alphabet].... It is to be noted also\nthat by adding to these Tobias and Judith, there are twenty-four books,\ncorresponding to the number of letters used by the Greeks."\n	-St. Hillary of Poitiers, "Commentaries on the Psalms," prologue, 15 (365 AD)\n\n"The twenty-two books according to the Hebrews are .... Jeremiah, with\nLamentations and the Letter, reckoned as one .... and [also] there is\nMaccabees."\n	-Origen, "Commentaries on the Psalms," Psalm 1 (245 AD)\n\n"Divine Scripture, addressing itself to those who love themselves and to\nthe boastful .... says most excellently [Baruch 3.16-19 follows]."\n	-St. Clement of Alexandria, "The Instuctor of Children," 2, 3, 36, 3, (203 AD)\n\n"....I learned accurately the books of the Old Testament ... Proverbs of\nSolomon, and also Wisdom ..."\n	-St. Melito of Sardes, fragment found in Eusebius' "History of the\nChurch," and dating from crica 177 AD, Book 4, 26, 14\n\n"It is likewise decreed: Now, indeed, we must treat of the divine\nScriptures: what the universal Catholic Church accepts and what she must\nshun.  The list of the Old Testament .... Wisdom, one book;\nEcclesiasticus, one book .... Tobit, one book ....

A reply to a post by kilroy@gboro.rowan.edu (aka Nancy's Sweetheart): \n\n?Human brains are infested with sin, and they can only be trusted\n?in very limited circumstances.\n\nI would beg to differ with you here.  The properly-formed conscience can\nbe trusted virtually ALL the time.  I am not so sure, though, about something\nso materialistic as the human brain.  Does that mass of tissue possess\nanything trustworthy?  Your observation would probably be valid if we were\ndiscussing the "mind" of an animal, but the human being is only half animal,\nas it were; and half spiritual. \n\n?At the moment he stops speaking, and people start interpreting, the\n?possibility of error appears.  Did he mean that literally or not?  We do\n?not have any record that he elaborated on the words.  Was he thinking of\n?Tran- or Con- substatiation?   He didn't say.  We interpret this passage\n?using our brains; we think and reason and draw conclusions.  But we know\n?that our brains are not perfect: our thinking often leads us wrong.  (This\n?is something that most of us have direct experience of.  8-)\n\nNow you have hit on the purpose of the Church.  It is by necessity the\ninfallible interpreter of divine revelation.  Without the Church,          \nChristianity would be nothing more than a bunch of little divisive sects.\n \n?Unless you are infallible, there are very few things you can be certain\n?of.  To the extent that doctrines rely on fallible human thinking, they\n?cannot be certain.\n\nThis argument of yours regarding the certainty of an observation or a\nconclusion is not necessarily substantiated by experience.  It reminds me\nof the theoretical physicist who said that you can never be certain of\na measurment because the sensor interferes with the field you are trying\nto measure.  Now, the experimental physicist will reply that although the\nmeasurement can never be made with absolute certainty, he is able to\ndetermine the certainty with which the measurement can be made, and this\nknowledge is often sufficient to render the measurement useful enough\nto allow evidence of the true condition of the field under observation.\nTherefore, although our minds are finite and susceptible to error, our\ncompetence in arriving at inductive insights gives confidence in our\nability to distinguish what is true from what is not true, even in areas\nnot subject to the experimental method. \n\n?Darren F Provine / kilroy@gboro.rowan.edu\n?"If any substantial number of  [ talk.religion.misc ]  readers read some\n?

You ask where we are.  I would echo that question.  I'm not trying to be\n   contentious.  But assuming that the Pope has universal jurisdiction\n   and authority, what authority do you rely upon for your decisions?\n   What prevents me from choosing ANY doctrine I like and saying that\n   Papal disagreement is an error that will be resolved in time?\n   This is especially true, since Councils of Bishops have basically\n   stood by the Pope.\n\nThe ultimate question is the traditional theology of the Church.  This\nis the *only* thing that it is possible to resist a Pope for: his\ndeparture from the traditional doctrine of the Church.  If commands\nfrom *any* authority conflict with Tradition, the commands must be\ndisobeyed.\n\nMy own view on this is that this conflict could only happen in a major\nway.  God would never allow a hair-splitting situation to develop; it\nwould be too complex for people to figure out.  I don't view the\npresent situation in the Church as anything extremely complicated.\nRun through a list of what has happened in the last 30 years in the\nCatholic Church, and any impartial observer will be aghast.\n\n   It appears that much of what lies at the heart of this matter is\n   disagreements over what is tradition and Tradition, and also over\n   authority and discipline.  \n\nThe problems stem from a general widespread ignorance of the Catholic\nFaith, in my opinion.  Most Catholics know about zilch about the\nCatholic Faith; this leaves them wide open for destruction by erring\nbishops.  It's basically the Reformation part II.\n\nThere is not even a question in my mind that in some respects the\nshards of the Catholic Church are currently being trampled upon by the\nCatholic hierarchy.  I could go on listing shocking things for an\nhour, probably.\n\nTake the situation in Campos, Brazil, for example.  I'm reading a book\non what happened there after Vatican Council II.  The bishop, Antonio\nde Castro-Mayer, never introduced all the changes that followed in the\nwake of Vatican II.  He kept the traditional Mass, the same old\ncatechisms, etc.  He made sure the people knew their faith, the\nCatholic theology of obedience, what Modernism was, etc.  He\ninnoculated the people against what was coming.\n\nWell, one day the order came from Rome for his retirement.  It came\nwhen the Pope was sick.  Bishop de Castro-Mayer waited until the Pope\nrecovered, then inquired whether this command was what the Pope really\nwanted, or something that some Liberal had commanded in his absence.\nThe Pope confirmed the decision.  So the good bishop retired.\n\nThe injustice that followed was completely incredible.  A new bishop\nwas installed.  He proceeded to expel most of bishop de Castro-Mayer's\nclergy from their churches, because they refused to celebrate the New\nMass.  The new bishop would visit a parish, and celebrate a New Mass.\nThe people would promptly walk out of the church en masse.  The bishop\nwas *enraged* by this.  He usually resorted to enlisting the help of\nthe secular authorities to eject the priest from the church.  The\npriests would just start building new churches; the people were\ncompletely behind them.  The old parishes had the New Mass, as the\nbishop desired -- and virtually no parishioners.\n\nThe prime motivation for all this was completely illegal, according to\ncanon law.  No priest can be penalized in any way for saying the\ntraditional Mass, because of legislation enacted by Pope Saint Pius V.\nNor is there any obligation to say the New Mass.\n\nDuring all this process, the people of Campos, not just private\nindividuals, but including civil authorities, were constantly sending\npetitions and letters to Rome to do something about the new Modernist\nbishop.  NOTHING was ever done; no help ever arrived from Rome.\nEventually 37 priests were kicked out, and about 40,000 people.\n\n   My question to the supporters of SSPX is this:\n\n	 Is there ANY way that your positions with respect to church reforms\n	 could change and be conformed to those of the Pope? (assuming that\n	 the Pope's position does not change and that the leaders of SSPX\n	 don't jointly make such  choice.)\n\n   If not, this appears to be claiming infallible teaching authority.\n   If I adopt the view that "I'm NOT wrong, I CAN'T be wrong, and\n   there's NO WAY I'll change my mind, YOU must change yours", that\n   I've either left the Catholic Church or it has left me.\n\nIf the Pope defines certain things ex cathedra, that would be the end\nof the controversy.  That process is all very well understood in\nCatholic theology, and anyone who doesn't go along with it is an\ninstant non-Catholic.\n\nThe problem here is that people do not appreciate what is going on in\nthe Catholic world.  If they knew the Faith, and what our bishops are\ndoing, they would be shocked!\n\n   We sould argue from now until the Second Coming about what the "real"\n   traditional teaching of the Church is.  If this were a simple matter\n   East and West would not have been separated for over 900 years.\n\nThis isn't the case in the Catholic Church.  There is a massive body\nof traditional teaching.  The Popes of the last 150 years are\nespecially relevant.  There is no question at all what the traditional\ndoctrine is.\n\n   I thought that the teaching magisterieum of the church did not allow\n   error in teachings regarding faith and morals even in the short term.`\n   I may be wrong here, I'm not Roman Catholic. :-)\n\nThat's heresy, more or less.  Although they have done a great job\nsince the Reformation, the last 30 years have seen so many errors\nspread that it's pitiful.\n\nInfallibility rests in the Pope, and in the Church as a whole.  In the\nshort term, a Pope, or large sections of the Church can go astray.  In\nfact, that's what usually happens during a major heresy: large\nsections of the Church go astray.  (The Pope historically has been\nmuch more reliable.)  Everything will always come back in the long\nrun.\n\n   What would be the effect of a Pope making an ex cathedra statement\n   regarding the SSPX situation?  Would it be honored?  If not, how\n   do you get around the formal doctrine of infallibility?\n   Again, I'm not trying to be contentions, I'm trying to understand.\n   Since I'm Orthodox, I've got no real vested interest in the outcome,\n   one way or the other.\n\nYes, it would be honored.  Infallibility is infallibility.  But what\nis he going to define?  That the New Mass is a better expression of\nthe Catholic Faith than the old?  That sex education in the Catholic\nschools is wonderful?  That all religions are wonderful except for\nthat professed by the Popes prior to Vatican II?\n\n   It does if the command was legitimate.  SSPX does not view the\n   Pope's commands as legitimate.  Why?  This is a VERY slippery slope.
Exactly. \n\nC. S. Lewis has taken a couple of pretty severe hits in this group lately.\nFirst somebody was accusing him of being self-righteous and unconvincing.\nNow we are told that we Christians should be embarrassed by him. (As well\nas by Josh McDowell, about whom I have no comment, having never read his\nwork.)\n\nAnyone who thinks that C. S. Lewis was self-righteous ought to read his\nintroduction to The Problem of Pain, which is his theodicy. In it, he\nexplains that he wanted to publish the book anonymously. Why? Although he\nbelieved in the argument he was presenting, he did not want to seem to\npresume to tell others how brave they should be in the face of their own\nsuffering. He did not want people to think that he was presenting himself\nas some kind of model of fortitude, or that he was anything other than what\nhe considered himself to be -- "a great coward." \n\nOFM has adequately handled the question of whether we ought to be\nembarrassed by Lewis' liar/lunatic/lord argument (which, by the way, is\npart of a *much* bigger discourse.) I would just like to add that, far from\nbeing embarrassed by Lewis, I am in a state of continual amazement at the\nsoundness and clarity of the arguments he presents. \n\n- Phil -

Until now you have asked for nothing in My name; ask, and \n	you will receive, that your joy may be made full."\n				-John 16:23-24\n\nI don't believe that we necessarily have to say " . . . In Christ's name.  \nAmen," for our prayers to be heard, but it glorifies the Son, when we \nacknowledge that our prayer is made possible by Him.  I believe that just as \nthose who were saved in the OT, could only be saved because Jesus would one day\nreconcile God to man, He is the only reason their prayers would be heard by \nGod.\n\n	For all of us have become like one who is unclean,\n	And all our righteous deeds are like a filthy garment;\n	And all of us wither like a leaf,\n	and our iniquities, like the wind, take us away.\n				-Isaiah 64:6, NAS\n\nOur prayers like the rest of our deeds are too unholy to go directly to the\nFather because they are tainted by our sin.  Only by washing these prayers with\nChrist's blood are they worthy to be lifted to to the Father.\n\n	"First, I thank my God through Christ Jesus . . ."\n				-Romans 1:8, NAS\n\nSome scholars believe that this is Paul recognizing that even his thanks are \ntoo unholy for the Father.\n	Basically, prayer is a gift of grace, I believe that only through Jesus\ndo our prayers have any power; thus, praying in His name glorifies and praises \nJesus for this beautiful and powerful gift He has given us.
I just about closed this once before.  I'm now doing so for real, after\ntonight's posting.
Woah...The context is about God's calling out a special people (the Jews) to\ncarry the "promise."  To read the meaning as literal people is to miss Paul's\nentire point.  I'd be glad to send anyone more detailed explanations of this\npassage if interested.
I agree.  Where in the Gospels does Jesus advocate any of the actions\nyou mention?  \n\nI couldn't find "witch" or "sorceress" in my concordance.  Is there\nsomething in the Epistles about witches?  (I'm still working my way\nthrough the Gospels.)\n\nJJ
Hi,\n\nI am new to this newsgroup, and also fairly new to christianity. I was\nraised as a Unitarian and have spent the better part of my life as an\nagnostic, but recently I have developed the firm conviction that the\nChristian message is correct and I have accepted Jesus into my life. I am\nhappy, but I realize I am very ignorant about much of the Bible and\nquite possibly about what Christians should hold as true. This I am trying\nto rectify (by reading the Bible of course), but it would be helpful\nto also read a good interpretation/commentary on the Bible or other\nrelevant aspects of the Christian faith. One of my questions I would\nlike to ask is - Can anyone recommend a good reading list of theological\nworks intended for a lay person?\n\nI have another question I would like to ask. I am not yet affiliated\nwith any one congregation. Aside from matters of taste, what criteria\nshould one use in choosing a church? I don't really know the difference\nbetween the various Protestant denominations.\n\nThanks for reading my post. \n\nSincerely,\n\nSteve Hoskins
(Well, I'll email also, but this may apply to other people, so\nI'll post also.)\n\n\n\nYour boss should be the person bring these problems to.  If he/she\ndoes not seem to take any action, keep going up higher and higher.\nSexual harrassment does not need to be tolerated, and it can be an\nenormous emotional support to discuss this with someone and know that\nthey are trying to do something about it.  If you feel you can not\ndiscuss this with your boss, perhaps your company has a personnel\ndepartment that can work for you while preserving your privacy.  Most\ncompanies will want to deal with this problem because constant anxiety\ndoes seriously affect how effectively employees do their jobs.\n\nIt is unclear from your letter if you have done this or not.  It is\nnot inconceivable that management remains ignorant of employee\nproblems/strife even after eight years (it's a miracle if they do\nnotice).  Perhaps your manager did not bring to the attention of\nhigher ups?  If the company indeed does seem to want to ignore the\nentire problem, there may be a state agency willing to fight with\nyou.  (check with a lawyer, a women's resource center, etc to find out)\n\nYou may also want to discuss this with your paster, priest, husband,\netc.  That is, someone you know will not be judgemental and that is\nsupportive, comforting, etc.  This will bring a lot of healing.\n\n\nThis happens to a lot of people.  Honest.  I believe it may seem\nto be due to gross insensitivity because of the feelings you are\ngoing through.  People in offices tend to be more insensitive while\nworking than they normally are (maybe it's the hustle or stress or...)\nI've had this happen to me a lot, often because they didn't realize\nmy car was broken, etc.  Then they will come back and wonder why I\ndidn't want to go (this would tend to make me stop being angry at\nbeing ignored and make me laugh).  Once, we went off without our\nboss, who was paying for the lunch :-)\n\n\nWell, if you can't turn to the computer for support, what would\nwe do?  (signs of the computer age :-)\n\nIn closing, please don't let the hateful actions of a single person\nharm you.  They are doing it because they are still the playground\nbully and enjoy seeing the hurt they cause.  And you should not\naccept the opinions of an imbecile that you are worthless - much\nwiser people hold you in great esteem.
I am beginning an e-mail discussion group about cell churches.

[ -and many others mailed me.  Here is a reply to one of the letters.  Seems to\nme that atheist do not like the doctrine of hell!]\n\n\n\nYour using 20th century concepts to interprete 1st century writers.  Of course,\nin your termonology, God could not "cease to exist."  However, that is not what\ndeath ever means in the Scriptures.  If you will study the word, you will see\nthat it signifies "separation."  Death is separation, not ceastation.  This is\nthe reason for the agony of the cross.  For the first time in eternity, one\nmember of the Godhead was separated from the other two.  \n\nI once met a young lady that was as beautiful as any model that ever lived. \nShe was as personable as any saint ever imagined.  She was to become my\n"girlfriend" for several years.  However, having been drafted, we were\nseparated by distance.  To me that was a form of death.  Later, she decided\nthat she couldn't wait for me to come home and bid me adue.  That to me was\ndeath.  It was separation from that which had made me whole.  Death is\nseparation and eternal death is eternal separation from His fellowship, not\nbecause He chose to send you into outer darkness, but because you chose to go\nthere.  \n\n\n\nWhen I rebelled against my earthly father, he spanked me.  I found no wisdom in\nthat until I had grown older and especially until I had my own children.  He\nwas trying to guide me away from hurt that would enter my life if I continued\non my suicidal course.  He did it in love though I interpreted it as harsh and\nunloving.  If God warns of impending danger, that is love.  If choose to let us\ndo as we please, and then at the end tell us the rules, that would be harsh. \nYou have a conscience, no matter how calused or fallen it is, that witnesses to\nyou that a thing is wrong and that there is cause for fear.  \n\n\nThis may give light to the error of your understanding.  One must have correct\nknowledge in order to have correct faith.  Faith and knowledge are inseparable.\n Jesus most certainly felt the "pinpricks" of life.  As the Scripture say:\n\nHeb. 4:15 For we do not have a high priest who cannot sympathize with our\nweaknesses, but One who has been tempted in all things as we are, yet without\nsin.\n\nThe kenosis passage of Phil 2 states that He gave up His Godhead attributes\nwhen He took upon Himself humanity.  It has been a favorite meditation of mine\nto think about this.  It was to be my PhD thesis.  "The Consciousness of\nChrist."  I have talked at length with a great many people about this\ninteresting study, including clh.  \n\nIt is my conclussion that as Jesus, the 2nd member of the Trinity, actually\nsuffered as we do.  He became part of the human race and experienced it as we\ndo.  He "grew in knowledge."  He chose not to grasp His omniscience, but chose\nto be taught.  It is my understanding that He was "led of the Spirit" to such\nan extent that sometimes it is hard to distinquish between Jesus the man and\nJesus as God.  But in Jn 8 where the adulterous women was thrown before Him,\nthe tenses are quite clear in that the whole situation took Him by surprise. \nThat is, He was not aware that this event was to take place in time.  He was\nliving sequential history as you or I.  \n\nMaybe some other time we can discuss this, but it is a very lengthy discussion\nand one that causes the curcuit breakers of the brain to pop more often than\nnot.\n\n\nI was once a member of that club.  THe "free thinker" is a glorious ideal.  By\ncontrast, of course, you believe that the believer is the unforunate repository\nof everything that is dogmatic, inhibited, reactionary and repressive.  I find\nsuch a stance to be as amusing as it is absurd.   If the liberal humanist\nwishes to criticize a Christian or a Buddhist or a Marxist, that is his right. \nBut what he must not pretend is that he was led to this solely by his "rational\ndoubt" when in fact he was led to it by his "faith".  He must acknowledge that\nwhile it is rational doubt for him as a "free thinker" to criticize the\nChristian, it might equally be a rational doubt for the Christian to criticize\nhim as a humanist.  If there is no faith, there can be no dout.  There is no\nfaith which cannot choose to cast doubt on some other faith.\n\nPascal pointed out that "sceptical arguments allow the positive to be positive.\n Few. . .speak dubiously of scepticism."  The fact that skeptics are not\nskeptical about skepticism is further evidence that to doubt anything we must\nbelieve in something else!  THe person who is skeptical toward one faith or\neven most faiths, will be the devoted adherent of another.  In fact, it is a\nmeasure of his poverty both that he is unaware of it and that he can define\nhimself only in negative terms, hence the term "a"-theist.\n\nSome people claim otherwise and argue vociferously for complete skepticism.  In\nmy campus ministry I ran across this more times than I care to remember. \nHowever, they disproved their own argument with every thought, every word,\nevery point of logic that they used.  Every moment of shared communication\nspeaks against their total skepticism.  Their very insistence of trying to make\nsense is eloquent testimony to assumptions that are powerful though silent.\n\nThat is to say, that complete skepticism is impossible and limited skepticism\nis arbitrary.  Next time you're in a room of skeptics, yell out "Look, your fly\nis undone!"  Each person chooses what he is skeptical about and what he\nbelieves without skepticism.  To stress this is to belabor the obvious, but it\nunderlines the point that no one can know exhaustively how he knows what he\nknows.  Pure objectivism is a myth and complete skepticism an impossiblity. \nThe answer to this impasse lies in  a 3rd way of knowing, one which is based on\npresuppositions.  But if knowledge proceeds on what must be presupposed before\nit is proved, the cover is blown on the pretentions of critical doubt, and\ncritical doubt depends on the idea that human knowledge is totally objective\nand neutral.  In other words, another myth.  \n\nPresuppositions my friend.  It is impossible to doubt anything unless there is\nsomething we do not doubt -our own assumptions/presuppostions.  Even these can\nbe criticezed only upon the basis of other assumptions.  Presuppostitons are\nour silent partners in thought but their silence must not be mistaken for\nabsence.\n\n\nOf course that is hardly an original statement.  Milton coined it but it had\nbeen in use for millenia.  It was even used in the first "Highlander" movie. \nBut again, your presuption is based on a faulty knowledge of the character of\nGod.  You are operating off of a presuppositional premise of humanistic\ntheology, not what He has revealed of Himself through history, through His\nprophets, through His Word, and lastly, but most of all, thru His Son.  If you\nare to reject God's annointed savior, then reject Him from a correct\nunderstanding of Himself.
A "new Christian" wrote that he was new to the faith and \nlearning about it "by reading the Bible, of course". I am not\nat all sure this is the best path to follow.\n	While the Bible is, for Christians, the word of God, the \nrevelation of God is Jesus Christ and the chief legacy of this\nrevalation is the Church. I am not recommending any one\ndenommination, but I do recommend finding a comfortable christian\ncongregation in which to develop your faith, rather than just\nreading the Bible.\n	This does not mean that the Bible should not be read, although\nI would stick to the Gospels, epistles, and Psalms and avoid the\nBook of Revelation altogether [until you are with friends you are\ncomfortable with]. I am sure that mistakenly fervent  projects to\nread the entire Bible have frequently bogged down with a remarkable\nlack of fervour somewhere in the middle of Leviticus, or for the really\nsturdy, somewhere in Chronicles.\n	The point is that the Bible is their to illustrate the Faith\nof Christians, but does not provide the totality of that faith. Vital\nbeliefs of virtually all Christians are simply not mentioned -\nthe Trinity, the duality of natures in Christ, types of Church\norganization. All these beliefs and practices have developed from the\nlived experience of the Christian people, an experience lived one\nhopes in the Spirit. As such the Bible, I think, is better studies\nin the context of a congregation, and the context of other reading.\n	Following up on a suggestion of an old confessor of mine, I \nwould even suggest that a good novel is a good way to reflect on the\nchristian life. [Most novels of any profundity are actually discussing\nthe nature of good and evil in the human heart]. My own induction into\nthe christian faith was brought about [after grace] through reading\nGraham Greene: _The Power and the Glory_ and the poetry of Gerard\nManley Hopkins. I would also recommend Graham Greene's _Monsignor\nQuixote_ and any novel by Iris Murdoch. The last is not even a Christian,\nbut such is her insistence on the need for the good life, that, frankly,\nI often am more uplifted and God directed after reading her than after\nreading many parts of the Bible. And that after all is what being\na Christian is all about: letting your soul and your life be, in\nsome way, directed towards the infinite, represented to us by\nthe person of Jesus Christ.
This is not true.  The athiest's position is that there is no PROOF of the\nexistence of God.  As much as some people accept their Church, their priests\nor straight from their own scriptures as the "proof", this does not \nsatisfy atheists.\n\nAtheists DO believe in recognisable authorities.  If they were as dogmatic as\nyou claim they are, they would be trying to prove 1 + 1 =2 every time they\ngot up.  What they dispute is that Churches, priests, scriptures etc.\nrepresent true authorities and know the TRUTH.\n\n\nAre you asking us to believe blindly?  You are trying to deny that part of\nus that makes us ask the question "Does God exist?" i.e. self-awareness and\nreason.  If we do not use our ability to reason we become as ignorant\nas the other animals on this earth.  Does God want us to be like that?\n\nYou are right that science and reason cannot PROVE anything.  However, if\nwe do not use them we can only then believe on FAITH alone.  And since\nwe can only use faith, why is one picture of "God" (e.g. Hinduism) any less\nvalid than another (e.g. Christianity)?

?Huh? Okay, so I'm not Eric Molas, but even if that _is_ how he\nfeels about life, I disagree with it.\n\n      Life, to me, is definitely NOT meaningless; it has precisely the\npurpose and meaning I choose to give it. I go on living because I _like_\nliving; if I needed any further reason, I'd be free - completely free! -\nto pick any reason that suited me. That freedom can be almost\nintoxicating; it's probably the closest I've ever been to a 'religious'\nexperience. I'm *very* glad I am an atheist; I wouldn't be anything\nelse.\n\n\n      Not unless, in explaining your own subjective experience, you also\ntry to convert him or proselytize. Merely explaining the effects you\npersonally experience religion as having on you, is not "infectious".\nNot unless Eric is paranoid, that is. ;->\n\n\n      Whatever floats your goat. You sound happy enough; that's fairly\nmuch all that matters, right?\n\n\n      Erh... Pardon, but it strikes me that sentence sounds reversible.\n\n\n      "Empty spot"? "God-shaped hole"? I hear such things a lot from\ntheists; never quite did understand what they were talking about.\nI have no such 'emptiness' or 'hole'. Maybe some others do, I wouldn't\nknow; but I don't, and if I did, I'd seek help about it. Doesn't sound\nlike a mentally healthy situation at all, walking around with a 'hole'\nin oneself.\n\n\n      Well, not having written that original post, I don't know if it\nwas intended to be interpreted in such a way; but, having reread it\ncarefully, I somewhat doubt it. At least, that's not how he gets across\nto _me_, your mileage may vary...
I agree with what Darren has to say here, but would like to add a \npersonal observation.  What I see as arrogance and the problem I have \nwith it is not a sense of personal certainty, but a lack of respect for\nothers who come to differing conclusions.  Clearly, this is not just \nChristian vs. Non-Christian; there is a whole spectrum of belief systems\nwithin Christianity.  I do not tend to argue with others about matters\nof personal faith because, like aesthetics, it is not demonstable by\nobjective means.  \n\nChoosing what to believe and rely on are important areas of personal \nsovereignty.  What bothers me is when others suggest that, in these \nmatters of faith, their specific beliefs are not only true to them \nbut are absolute and should be binding on others.  It follows from this\nthat God must give everyone the same revelation of truth, and thus \nanyone who comes to a different conclusion is intentionally choosing\nthe wrong path.  This is the arrogance I see; a lack of respect for the\nhonest conclusions of others on matters which are between them and God.\nEven a personal certainty leaves room for the beliefs of others.  It is\nuniversalizing those matters of personal faith, coupled by a proud\nnotion that one's relationship with God is superior to other's, that\nleads to arrogance.  In my honest (and nonuniversal) opinion. :-)\n\n\n\ncomments, criticism welcome...\n-Ken\nalvin@ucsu.colorado.edu
For whoever does the will of my Father in heaven is my brother and sister\nand mother."
some deleted\n\n\nDear Will,\n\nI've never replied on this thing before so I hope it gets thru ok.\nI had a few thoughts!:\n\n"Faith on its own, if not accompanied by action is dead" - James 2:17\n\nFaith is both belief and action.\nIf I say that I am a great swimmer but I never go swimming, am I really a\nswimmer? and will people believe that I am?\nLikewise if I say I'm a Christian but I never talk to God, am I really a\nChristian? My faith is demonstrated by my action. The fact that we talk to\nGod proves we have faith. Satan believes in God but does not follow Him!\n\nIn a similar vein, I have recently been challenged by 1John2:3-6\nv3 says "We know that we have come to know Him if we obey His commands"\nI find this verse quite encouraging as it could imply that 'if we have\ncome to know Him, then we'll obey His commands' cos He lives within us and\nwe cannot help but obey what He says.\nI tend to feel that as we daily submit ourself to God He will keep changing\nus into the likeness of Jesus and His fruit and works will be automatically\nproduced in our lives.\n\nHope this helps.
The analogy does not depend on the premisses being true, because the \nquestion under discussion is not truth but arrogance. \n\nA similar analogy might be a medical doctor who believes that a blood \ntransfusion is necessary to save the life of a child whose parents are \nJehovah's Witnesses and so have conscientious objections to blood \ntransfusion. The doctor's efforts to persuade them to agree to a blood \ntransfusion could be perceived to be arrogant in precisely the same way as \nChristians could be perceived to be arrogant.\n\nThe truth or otherwise of the belief that a blood transfusion is necessary \nto save the life of the child is irrelevant here. What matters is that the \ndoctor BELIEVES it to be true, and could be seen to be trying to foce his \nbeliefs on the parents, and this could well be perceived as arrogance.
It was a gift from God.  I think basically the reasoning was that the\ntradition in the Church held that Mary was also without sin as was Jesus.\nAs the tenets of faith developed, particularly with Augustine, sin was\nmore and more equated with sex, and thus Mary was assumed to be a virgin\nfor life (since she never sinned, and since she was the spouse of God, etc.)\nSince we also had this notion of original sin, ie. that man is born with\na predisposition to sin, and since Mary did not have this predisposition\nbecause she did not ever sin, she didn't have original sin.  When science\ndiscovered the process of conception, the next step was to assume that\nMary was conceived without original sin, the Immaculate Conception.\n\nMary at that time appeared to a girl named Bernadette at Lourdes.  She \nrefered to herself as the Immaculate Conception.  Since a nine year old \nwould have no way of knowing about the doctrine, the apparition was deemed\nto be true and it sealed the case for the doctrine.\n\nRCs hold that all revelation comes from two equally important sources, that\nbeing Sacred Scripture and Holy Tradition.  In this case, mostly tradition.
[insert huge deletion of all following material since it had little\nrelevance to what I've found]\n\nOK.  The people before Jesus didn't have Jesus, right (so far, I've\nannounced that space is a vacuum)?  The people who lived during the time\nJesus lived (especially disciples) were taught this:  "I tell you the\ntruth, anyone who has faith in me will do what I have been doing.  He\nwill do even greater things than these, because I am going to the\nFather.  And I will do whatever you ask in my name, so that the Son may\nbring glory to the Father.  You may ask me for anything in my name, and\nI will do it." (John 14:12-14)\nSo, Jesus asked them to pray for things in his name.  Since that time,\nthe request has been the same, not to ask for intercession from other\nbeings, but from Jesus.  Remember that "there is one God and one\nmediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus, who gave himself as\na ransom for all men--the testimony given in its proper time." (1\nTimothy 2:5-6.  Also, "there have been many of those priests [talking\nabout priests among the Hebrews], since death prevented them from\ncontinuing in office; but because Jesus lives forever, he has a\npermanent priesthood.  Therefore he is able to save completely those who\ncome to God through him, because he always lives to intercede for them."\n(Hebrews 7:23-25).  Hebrews is also full of areas talking about Jesus\nbeing our mediator rather than any other man.\n\nJoe Fisher
Yes, and what about Paul saying:\n\n26 Be ye angry, and sin not: let not the sun go down upon your wrath:\n(Ephesians 4:26).\n\nObviously then, we can be angry w/o sinning.\n\nJon\n\n------------------------------------------------\nJon Ogden         - jono@mac-ak-24.rtsg.mot.com\nMotorola Cellular - Advanced Products Division\nVoice: 708-632-2521      Data: 708-632-6086\n------------------------------------------------
Oh, that must explain Matthew 18:\n\n1) In that hour came the disciples unto Jesus, saying, "Who then is greatest in\nthe kingdom of heaven?"\n2) And he called to him a little child, and set him in the midst of them,\n3) and said, "Verily I say unto you, Except ye turn, and become as little\nchildren, ye shall in no wise enter into the kingdom of heaven.\n14) Even so it is not the will of your father who is in heaven, that one of these\nlittle ones should perish.\n\nNice thing about the Bible, you don't have to invent a bunch of convoluted\nrationalizations to understand it, unlike your arguments for original sin. Face\nit, original sin was thought up long after the Bible had been written and has no\nbasis from the scriptures.
Tsk.tsk. Too much argument on non-issues !\nI'm Roman Catholic and it seems to me that people\ncelebrate Easter and Christmas for itself rather\nthan how it relates to Jesus. I don't really\ncare about some diety. If people have some other\ndefinition of Easter, then that's their business.\nDon't let it interfere with my Easter.\n\n"Resurrection Sunday" 8-) Where did that come from ?\nIf people celebrate Easter for the Cadburry bunny,\nthat's their business.

: >People who reject God don't want to be wth Him in heaven.  We spend our \n: >lives choosing to be either for Him or against Him.  God does not force \n: >Himself on us.\n\n: I must say that I am shocked. My impression has been that Jayne Kulikaskas\n: usually writes this much less offensive and ludicrous than this. I am not\n: saying that the offensiveness is intentional, but it is clear and it is\n: something for Christians to consider.\n\nJayne stands in pretty good company.  C.S. Lewis wrote a whole book\npromoting the idea contained in her first sentence quoted above.  It is\ncalled "The Final Divorce".  Excellent book on the subject of Heaven and\nHell, highly recommended.  It's an allegory of souls who are invited, indeed\nbeseeched to enter Heaven, but reject the offer because being with God in\nHeaven means giving up their false pride.
You haven't fully explained the atheist position.  Many theists believe that\nthere is "no proof of the existence of God" but choose to believe in him\nanyway.  I haven't yet found an argument for atheism that can't quickly be\nbroken down to unprovable assumptions.  This isn't a problem with me (everybody\nneeds to have a faith) but if you believe that you can provide a "purely \nlogical" argument for the nonexistence of God, I'd really like to see it.\n\n\n\n  Ahh...but when you use science and reason, you have faith in certain beliefs\nof the scientific method--for example:\n\n  The physical laws of the universe are stable.\n  Our observations of reality are a valid basis for a determination of truth.\n  Objective reality exists.\n  Logical argument is a valid way to answer all questions.\n  \n  Can you prove any of these?
Just a quick question. If Mary was Immaculately concieved, so she\n   could be a pure vessel, does this mean that she was without sin\n   and, therefore, the perfect (meaning sinless) female human being?\n   Is this why she is held so highly in the Catholic Church despite\n   it's basically patriarchical structure?\n\nShe was immaculately conceived, and so never subject to Original Sin,\nbut also never committed a personal sin in her whole life.  This was\npossible because of the special degree of grace granted to her by God.\n\nShe is regarded so highly because of her special relationship to God,\nand everything that flows from that relationship.\n\nThe Catholic Church sees her as the new Eve.  (The Fathers in the\nearly Church use this particular figure a lot.)
John, \n\nWhile I will not take the time to rebut you point by point, I will suggest\nthree current works which I think will be helpful in your quest to answer\nthis question.  John Dominic Crossan (Professor of Religion at De Paul Univ)-\n_The Cross That Spoke_ Harper and Row Pub. 1988, Also his latest work \n_The Historical Jesus - The Life of A Mediterranean Jewish Peasant_ Harper\nand Row Pub. 1991,  Also two works of Burton Mack (Professor of New Testament\nat the Claremont Graduate School) _A Myth of Innocence_ Fortress Press 1988,\nAnd his latest book _The Lost Gospel: The Book of Q and Christian Origins_\nHarper and Row, 1992.  You might start with Mack's book on Q and then \nexamine the others afterward.  However I think that once you do that you will\nsee that your "evidence" is not as sturdy as you'd like.  Most of the tired\narguements you stated, assume eyewitness accounts, such is not the case. But\nAnyway look at Mack and Crossan and then get back to us.
This is an excellent question and I'll be anxious to see if there are\nany such cases.  I doubt it.  In the medieval period (esp. 10th-cent.\nwhen Aquinas flourished) argument was a useful tool because everyone\n"knew the rules."  Today, when you can't count on people knowing even\nthe basics of logic or seeing through rhetoric, a good argument is\noften indistinguishable from a poor one.\n\nSorry; just one of my perennial gripes...<:->\n\nKen
The parable of the Prodigal Son is not about who is and who isn't an\nimmoral person. It is about grace and the love of God. Most people\nwould agree with that concerning the younger son. The elder son is\nsimply a negative example of the some thing. He thinks that he must\nearn his father's love, that he has earned it, that he is entitled\nto it. His father tells him that he is on the wrong track. He has always\nbeen loved--for the same reason his brother has always been: he is\nhis father's son.\n\nWe are too performance oriented to consistently get the point. We are\nwilling to be saved by grace, but once we are Christians we want to\ngo back to earning and deserving.\n\n"Are you so foolish? After beginning with the Spirit, are you now trying\n to attain your goal by human effort?" Gal 3:3 NIV
I agree.  God makes the husband the head of the house.  But he surely\ncan't do it alone.  He needs the help of his beloved wife whom the\nLord gave him.\n\nAt least that's how it is in my house.  I thank God for the beautiful\nwoman He has brought into my life.  I couldn't lead without the help\nof my wonderful wife.
Hi there netters,\nI have a question I would very much like to see some discussion on:\nIs there such a thing as a 'justifible' war? \n\nWhat I would love to see it some basis from scripture for either: "All war  \nis wrong", or "Some war is justifiable". \n\nTo get things started I would like to outline why I am asking the  \nquestion. In my high school days I had been quite involved in the the New  \nZealand Cadet Forces (This is a bit like ROTC from what I understand of  \nit, but with a lot more emphasis on fun than military career training).  \nThrough this I became extremely enamoured of flying, have become involved  \nin the sport of gliding, and have a great interest in military aviation  \nhardware as the very best a 'real' flyer could ask for. My favourite  \ncomputer games are the accurate simulations of military aircraft, both  \npast and present. \n\nI became a Christian about 10 years ago, and at the time rejected all  \nmilitary activity as immoral. For me, all war was in complete opposition  \nto God's commandments to love one another, especially one's enemies.\n\nDuring the war in Iraq, I found myself with great excitement listening to  \nthe reports of the effectiveness of the the attacks using the aviation  \ntechnology I so admire - The F117A 'Stealh' bomber, the F14, F15 and F16  \nstrike aircraft, etc. After the war concluded I began to really enjoy  \nsimulations based around this conflict - Great to go and bomb Saddam's  \nbio-weapons plants in an F117A on my computer, or shoot down some of his  \nMig's in an F16. The simulation of the death of people was a wonderful  \ngame. I imagine the real pilots view the real thing in much the same way.  \nOne only has to look at the language used to see that the personal impact  \nof war is ignored: A building containing people, or an aircraft flown by a  \npilot is simply a 'target'. Dead civilians are 'collateral damage'. These  \neuphanisms are a way of removing the reality of war from the people whose  \nsupport are necessary for the continued waging of war - One only has to  \nlook at Vietnam to see how important public opinion is.\n\nNow we see troops sponsored by the United Nations entering Somalia, and  \nthe prospect of military intervention in the Muslim/Croat/Serb conflict in  \nthe former Yugoslavia. My revulsion in particular to the siege of  \nSarajevo, and in the last few days of (sorry 'bout spelling) Sebrenitsa,  \nhas caused me to rethink where I stand on 'justifiable' war.\n\nI will list several wars in the last 50 years I can look at each, and say  \n- Yes this may have been justifible, this may not. These are simply my gut  \nreactions to each - In many cases with the benefit of the impartiality  \nhistory brings. Let me go through a few and state some of my reasons for  \nmy reaction - I am not a historian, so excuse any historical blunders, I  \nam working from popular history as it is known in New Zealand.\n\n1. The Second World War\n	- Murder of Jews - Hitler had to be stopped.\n	- Massive civilian casualties on both sides \n		- Dresden, Hiroshima/Nagasaki\n	- Probably justifiable.\n\n2. Korean war\n	- Political expansionism by North Korea, basically\n	  communism vs. capitalism.\n	- Probably not justifiable.\n\n3. Vietnam\n	- As above, worsened by US involvement.\n\n4. Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia.\n	- Genocide by Khmer Rouge.\n	- Probably justifiable.\n\n5. Iraq (Desert Storm)\n	- Political expansionism, threat to world oil supply\n	- Other factors such as genocide.\n	- Not sure, but probably justifiable\n\n6. A future involvement in Bosnia\n	- Genocide - so called 'Ethnic Cleansing'\n	- Emotive - much TV coverage of atrocities and civilian casualties.\n	- Probably justifiable\n\n7. Possible future use of nuclear weapons - tactical or strategic,  \nsomewhere in the world by the US in response to someone else - e.g. Libya  \nor Israel.\n	- My feelings in this are simple\n	- Nuclear war/weapons are abhorrent\n	- I love the New Zealand government's stand on banning all nuclear\n	  armed or powered warships from NZ port.\n	- Never justifiable.\n\nThese are my own views, I have looked at scripture, and I am confused. I  \nwould appreciate others view, particularly those based on scripture. I  \n*don't* want a - Naaahh, yer wrong - I think answers 8-).\n\nThanks for your help.\n\n==========================================================================\n                                    |\nAlastair Thomson,                   | Phone +64-3-479-8347\nChief Programmer,                   | Fax   +64-3-479-8529\nThe Black Albatross Porject,        |\nUniversity of Otago,                |\nDepartment of Computer Science,     | e-mail alastair@farli.otago.ac.nz\nP.O.

To recapitulate a bit:\n\n- The essence of marriage is two people's commitment to each other.\n\n- If two people claim to be married "in their hearts" but are not\n  willing to have the marriage recognized by church and state, that's\n  prima facie evidence that the commitment isn't really there.\n\n- There are obvious situations in which Christian marriage is possible\n  without a civil or church wedding: if you're stranded on a desert\n  island, or if your state forbids the marriage for an unjust reason\n  (e.g., laws against interracial marriage).\n\n- The legal concept of "common-law marriage" is meant to ensure that\n  the state will recognize marriages that did not start out with the\n  usual ceremony and record-keeping.\n\n- Pastorally, I'm concerned that people should not use "being married\n  in God's eyes" as an excuse for living together without a formal wedding.\n  One has a duty to have one's marriage properly recorded and witnessed.\n  \n- But there are also people who have been through a wedding ceremony\n  without making a genuine commitment, and therefore are not married\n  in God's eyes.

So true.  I'm not sure of the basis of the belief, but it was a widely\nheld belief among the laity of the RC church and their support of it\nlead to it being declared to be true.  Basically the teaching on infallibility\nholds that the pope is infallible in matters of faith and doctrine, the\ncollege of bishops is likewise infallible, and the laity is as well.\nThe pope gets most of the attention/criticism but the consensus of the\nother bodies is equally infallible (according to RC teaching).
There are a lot of people running around saying "God told me this" and \n"God told me that" these days.  Some people really have heard God, and others\nheard their glands.  Mario Murrillo mentioned this in a sermon once.  He\nsaid someone told him, "The Lord gave me a song."  He said that it was\nthe worst song he had ever heard.\n\n"I know why he gave you that song," Murillo said, "He didn't want it anymore."\n\nBut God does still speak to His people today, and the idea is contrary to the\nidea of a closed cannon.  Ireneaus wrote about all the gifts of the Spirit\nin the church of His day (2nd and 3rd century) and he was one of the first\nto put forth a New Testament cannon, which was almost identical to the one\nwe have today.  He believed in a closed cannon.  \n\nMany prophets prophesied prophecies which were not recorded in the Scriptures.\nFor example, one prophet in Kings, whose name starts with an "M" who\nprophecied that the king would lose a battle.  That is the only prophecy\nhe gave recorded in Scripture, and we no that he had given other prophecies\nbecause the king complained before he heard the prophecy, "He never prophesies\nanything good about me."  Yet only one little paragraph of all of his \nlifetime of prophecies are recorded in Scripture.  There are numerous examples.\nBarnabas was a prophet, Acts says, before he was even sent out as an \napostle.  Yet his writings are not recorded in Scripture.  Only two of\nAgabus prophecies are mentioned in Scripture.  He was already a prophet\nbefore he gave them.  \n\nSo prophecy may be genuine and from God, but that does not make it \nScripture.  \n\n\nI don't know about translations of Scripture, but I am familiar with \nprophecies that give applications for Scripture.  There are also \nsimilar examples in the Bible.  Several times Peter interprets prophecies\nin a seemingly prophetic way, for example, "And his bishoprick let another\ntake" concerning Judas office.\n\nA clearer example can be found in Matthew 24.  Jesus is prophesying about\nwhat will happen before His return and He quotes a passage out of Joel\nabout the sun being darkened and the moon turning to blood.  So Scriptural\nprophecy can be used in later prophecy.  \n\nSometimes this sort of thing can cross over into being a word of knowledge,\nbut gifts of the Spirit seem to overlap.  Words of knowledge and wisdom\ncan overlap.  The word of knowledge and prophecy can overlap.  \nInterpretation of tounges is very similar to prophecy.  Healings are often\nconsidered miracles.  So sometimes the distinction between gifts is a \nbit hazy.  Imho, it doesn't usually matter that much if we are able to\nlabel a phenomenon, as long as we recognize them as the work of the \nSpirit, and use them according to His leading.
My family has never been particularly religious - singing Christmas\ncarols is about the limit for them. Thus I've never really believed in God and\nheaven, although I don't actually believe that they don't exist either -\nI'm sort of undecided, probably like a lot of people I guess.\n        Lately I've been thinking about it all a lot more, and I wondered how\nreligious people can be so convinced that there is a God. I feel as though\nI want to believe, but I'm not used to believing things without proof -\njust as I can't believe that there definitely isn't a God, so I can't\ndefinitely believe that there is. I wondered if most of you were brought up by\nreligious families and never believed any different. Can anyone help me to\nunderstand how your belief and faith in God can be so strong.\n\n        Another question that frequently crosses my mind is which religion is\ncorrect?? How do you choose a religion, and how do you know that the Christian\nGod exists and the Gods of other religions don't?? How do you feel about\npeople who follow other religions?? How about atheists?? And people like me -\nagnostics I suppose. Do you respect their religion, and accept their\nbeliefs as just as valid as your own?? Isn't there contradiction between\nthe religions?? How can your religion be more valid than any others?? Do\nyou have less respect for someone if they're not religious, or if they follow\na different religion than you would if they were Christian??\n\n        Also, how much of the scriptures are correct?? Are all events in\nthe bible really supposed to have happened, or are they just supposed to be\nstories with morals showing a true Christian how to behave??\n\n        I generally follow most of the Christian ideas, which I suppose are\nfairly universal throughout all religions - not killing, stealing, etc, and\n'Loving my neighbour' for want of a better expression. The only part I find\nhard is the actual belief in God.\n\n        Finally, what is God's attitude to people like me, who don't quite\nbelieve in Him, but are generally fairly 'good' people. Surely not\nbelieving doesn't make me a worse person?? If not, I find myself wondering why\nI so strongly want to really believe, and to find a religion.\n\n        Sorry if I waffled on a bit - I was just writing ideas as they came\ninto my head. I'm sure I probably repeated myself a bit too.\n\n                        Thanks for the help,\n                                Paul Simmons
Desiree Bradley (Desiree_Bradley@mindlink.bc.ca) asked us whether we\nshould think of the Serbs as doing God's work in Bosnia.  I've\nrefrained from posting, in hope that someone who is more familiar with\nthe OT than I would answer.  But at this point I feel I have to say\nsomething.\n\nMany things about this posting bother me.  I know of not the slightest\nsuggestion in the NT that Christians should use force to propagate the\nGospel, and the idea that we should not be concerned about the death\nof Moslems violates the heart of the Gospel.  Christ died to break\ndown these distinctions.  In him there is neither Jew nor Greek, there\nis neither slave nor free, there is neither male nor female.  If\nMoslems do not know him, we may preach to them, but we don't kill\nthem.  Furthermore, the attack is between states, not religions.\nThere are Christians being attacked as well.  One of the towns under\nattack is one of the few places where Christians and Moslems are\nliving together peacefully.\n\nThe precedents being suggested are from the OT.  There are in fact two\ndifferent things being alluded to.  The first is from the entry into\nCanaan.  For that to be a parallel, we would need for God to have\npromised this land through a prophet.  And we would need the war to be\na holy war.  There were tight constraints on behavior in those\nattacks.  Any violations were likely to cause the Israelites to be\ndefeated.  Rape would not have been tolerated.  While the accounts in\nJoshua emphasize towns that were totally destroyed, note that it was\npossible for a town to make peace with the Israelites, and that once\nthat was done -- even when deception was involved -- they were\nexpected to honor it.  In contrast, there have been many violations of\nagreement in this incident. I see no evidence that God has granted\nBosnia to the Serbs as a promised land, and if he had, their behavior\nwould have disqualified this from being a holy war.\n\nThe other OT parallel is from later, when Israel was defeated by\nAssyria and Babylonia.  The prophets saw this as a judgement on Israel\nfor her sins.  Someone asks whether we shouldn't see this as a\njudgement on the Bosnians for their sins.  This sounds like a replay\nof the old claim that we shouldn't have doctors or hospitals because\nillness is God's judgement.  Yes, even bad things may be used by God\nfor good.  That includes actions of bad people.  But that doesn't\njustify them.  If you read the prophets, you find them very clear that\nin attacking Israel, the Assyrians and Babylonians were acting as\n*unintentional* agents of God.  Their intent was to attack God's\npeople, and they would be judged for it.  The fact that they were\nactually carrying out God's plan didn't excuse their action.\nFurthermore, we shouldn't conclude from this that all attacks are\njudgements from God.  God explicitly interpreted that case, through\nhis prophets.  As far as I know, he did not send any prophets to\nBosnia.  While I find it hard to see any good in the current fighting,\nI am sure God will eventually make good come out of bad.  But that\ndoesn't justify it, and it won't save the people who are doing it from\njudgement.
Coming from a long line of "hot tempered" people, I know temper when I see\nit.  One of the tell tale signs/fruits that give non-christians away - is\nwhen their net replies are acrid, angry and sarcastic.  \n\nWe in the net village do have a laugh or two when professed, born again\nchristians verbally attack people who might otherwise have been won to\nchristianity and had originally joined the discussions because they were\n"spiritually hungry."  Instead of answering questions with sweetness and\nsincerity, these chrisitan net-warriors, "flame" the queries. \n\nYou don't need any enemies.  You already do yourselves the greatest harm.
On 12-Apr-93 in Environmentalism and paganism\n\nAnd what of those of us who already have answers to their questions without\nturning to christianity (or, in my case, any religion)?  Whay RIGHT do you\nhave to presume to lecture me about what I should believe??
Undoubtedly people adopt atheism for many reasons, but I suspect that a biggie\nis that the God they've believed in is (in J.B. Phillips's words) "too small". \nIf a person's understanding of God is not allowed to grow and develop, it will\neventually become inadequate.  The grey-haired gentleman on a throne who was a\ncomforting image in childhood becomes a joke.\n\nA therapist friend of mine sometimes suggests to her clients that they "fire\nGod".  What she means by that is letting go of an inadequate understanding of\nGod to make room for a fuller one.  But she follows up by encouraging them to\n"hire a new one".  My guess is that a lot of folks go through the firing\nprocess, but are not adequately supported in the subsequent re-hire.
Hi,\n	Does anyone know anything about this group and what they\ndo? Any info would be appreciated. Thanks!
: Hi,\n\n: I am new to this newsgroup, and also fairly new to christianity.\n: ... I realize I am very ignorant about much of the Bible and\n: quite possibly about what Christians should hold as true. This I am trying\n: to rectify (by reading the Bible of course), but it would be helpful\n: to also read a good interpretation/commentary on the Bible or other\n: relevant aspects of the Christian faith. One of my questions I would\n: like to ask is - Can anyone recommend a good reading list of theological\n: works intended for a lay person?\n\nI'd recommend McDowell's "Evidence that Demands a Verdict" books (3 I\nthink) and  Manfred Brauch's "Hard Sayings of Paul".  He also may have\ndone "Hard Sayings of Jesus".  My focus would be for a new Christian to\nstruggle with his faith and be encouraged by the historical evidence,\nespecially one who comes from a background which emphasizes knowable faith.
Hmmm... people in the americas before the time of Christ, children who\ndie young, etc. ?\n\n\n\n\n   But of course, the popular conception of hell (correct or incorrect) is\nsomething akin to eternal perpetuation of consciousness, at the very least.\n\n\n\n   I think a good number of atheists believe there is nothing beyond \nbodily death, but it is simply an abuse of language to say they believe\nthey're going to hell. They believe they're going to _die_. Understand\nthat you've turned Hell into a verb. Using the same logic, it also follows\nthat all animals are 'going to Hell.' Are you sure this is what you want\nto say? (presumably animals don't have the opportunity to get to heaven,\nbut this still doesn't change the fact that they're going to Hell (die\na final death))\n\n   I don't claim to know whether or not there is an afterlife of _some_\nsort, but if Hell is as you described (final death, and\nnot eternal perpetuation of consciousness) it will be true that\nthere will never be a moment when I am aware of my non-existence. \n(assuming I 'go to Hell' and not to Heaven) In other words, I'll\nnever know I'm dead. Hmmm... \n\n\n\n    Ever hear people say of a loved one who was ill, and has died:\n "At least she's not suffering any more; She's in Heaven now." ?\n\n    Consider the following statement:\n "At least she's not suffering any more; She's in Hell now."\n\n    The above statement sounds odd, but according to your definition of Hell, \nit would be a true statement. The person in Hell would not be suffering. \nGranted, they wouldn't be *anything* (wouldn't be having any\nconscious experience whatsoever). \n\n    You say Hell (death) is eternal. However, this loses its meaning \nto a dead person. And to me, it seems that the threat of some sort \nof eternal punishment only makes sense/has force if one expects to\nbe conscious throughout this eternity. \n\n    Many atheists believe that the thirst for an afterlife is simply the\nproduct of propaganda ("Friend, do you want the FREE gift of e-ternal life?"\nIt's my understanding that the early jews did not believe in an afterlife.\nCan anyone back me up on this?) combined with the survival instinct all\nanimals share. The difference is we have consciousness, and once we get the\nidea of eternal life drilled into our brains, we then desire a sort of\nsuper-survival. \n\n \n\n    That would depend on what Heaven is like. If God is a King, and \nan eternity in heaven consists of giving thanks and praise to the King,\nI might opt for Hell. I read a lovely account of a missionary trying to\nconvert Eskimos to Christianity in the book _The Illusion of Immortality_\nby Corliss Lamont. The missionary started to speak about Heaven. \n"Are there seals in heaven? Will we be able to go hunting?" asked an\nEskimo. The missionary said no. The group of Eskimos then said something\nto the effect of, "Well what good is your Heaven if there's no hunting?\nScram." I highly recommend the above book (IOI) to anyone who wants an\naccount of the other side of the immortality coin (that there is no \nimmortality). \n\n\n\n\n   Pax,
Not quite correct.  Biblical teaching expects us to celebrate the\nresurrection of Christ not once a year but every time someone is baptized.\n Col. 2:12-Buried with him in baptism, wherein also ye are risen with him\nthrough the faith of the operation of God, who hath raised him from the\ndead."  Rom. 6:4-Therefore we are buried with him in baptism into death:\nthat like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the\nFather, even so we also should walk in newness of life."\nThose really want to celebrate the resurrection should by faith walk in\nnewness of life after baptism.  It is not necessary to celebrate a pagan\ngoddess in the process.\n\nPaul answered your question in Romans 9.  In v. 4 he stated that the\nadoption, the glory, the covenants, the giving of the law, the service of\nGod, and the promises were given to the Israelites.  It is a package deal.\n He goes on to identify those who are true Israelites.  Vs 6-8 makes it\nplain that the true Israelites are not those who are born that way but\nthose who accept the promise of God.  Paul continued to emphasize that he\nwas an Israelite in 2 Cor. 11:22, then in Gal 3:29 he says that all those\nwho belong to Christ are Abraham's seed, and heirs to all the promises\ngiven to the Israelites.  The promises come with the law.  It is all or\nnothing.  Why is it that you only want to discard one part of the law? \nCertainly you would want your husband to be faithful to you.  Or do you\nbelieve that adultery is no longer forbidden?  Same law.\n\nBTW  please give a reference for your statement that the Gentiles are only\nrequired to observe the basis commandmants.  Could you list those\nplease.  Acts 15 deals with circumcision and the law of Moses which was\nadded because of transgression of God's eternal law (Gal 3:19; Rom 4:15)

He talked about many of the same  \nthings you mentioned in your post, but here he went into a little more  \ndetail.  I'll paraphrase as best I can:\n\n"Suppose you were part of the `Christian consipracy' which was going to  \ntell people that Christ had risen.  Never mind the stoning, the being  \nburned alive, the possible crucifixion ... let's just talk about a  \nscourging.  The whip that would be used would have broken pottery, metal,  \nbone, and anything else that they could find attached to it.  You would be  \nstood facing a wall, with nothing to protect you.\n\n"When the whip hit you the first time, it would tear the flesh off you  \nwith instant incredibly intense pain.  You would think to yourself `All  \nthis for a lie?'  The second hit would drop you to your knees, you would  \nscream out in agony that your raw back was being torn at again.  You would  \nsay to yourself: `All this for a lie?'  And you had 37 more coming.\n\n"At the third hit you would scream out that it was all a lie, beg for them  \nto stop, and tell them that you would swear on your life that it had all  \nbeen a lie, if they would only stop...."\n\nIt is amazing enough that those who believed kept their faith under such  \ntorture.... but for a lie?  There is no one fool enough to do that.... And  \nno one came forward.\n\nExcellent post John, thanks for taking the time.
It is told in the Gospels that the Pharisees (sp.?) and scribes bribed\nthe Roman soldiers to say that the Diciples stole his body in the night.\nGood enough excuse for the Jewish and Roman objectives (of that day).

[ The discussion begins: why does the universe exist at all?  ]\n\n= \n= Must there be a "why" to this?

That isn't\ntrue of something outside of nature (i.e., *super*natural).\n\n[ ... ]\n\n= \n= It may be that one day man not only can create life but can also\n=      create man.

(I've never been much of a prophet, though. I\ncan't even *picture* New York in my mind 8^] ).  I don't believe *any*\ntechnology would be able to produce that necessary *spark* of life, despite\nhaving all of the parts available.

Mark Gregory Foster writes (concerning 1 Corinthians 16:2):\n\n > The idea was introduced to me once that the reason Paul wanted\n > the Corinthians to lay aside money for the collection on the\n > first day of the week was that this was when they received their\n > weekly wages.\n\nBut the ancient Romans did not observe a seven-day week.  Unless a\nman was working for a Jewish employer, he is unlikely to have been\npaid on the first day of a seven-day week. Nor would a Jewish\nemployer have kept his wages over the week-end (see Lev 19:13; Dt\n24:15).
OFM responds to a query about reference works:\n\n   [Aside from a commentary, you might also want to consider an\n   introduction.  These are books intended for use in undergraduate Bible\n   courses.  They give historical background, discussion of literary\n   styles, etc.  And generally they have good bibligraphies for further\n   reading.  I typically recommend Kee, Froehlich and Young's NT\n   introduction...\n\nTwo other Intros to consider:\n\nThe "Introduction" by Ku:mmel is a translation of a strandard NT text.\nThe references are slightly dated and the style is somewhat dense, but\nthe book contains a wealth of information.\n\nPerrin and Duling's Intro is also very good.  It's somewhat more\nmodern than Ku:mmel's but not quite so densely packed.  Also the\nauthors tend to go through the books of the NT in the historical order\nof composition; this gives a very useful perspective on the\ndevelopment of the NT.\n\n   ... There are also some good one-volume commentaries.  ... Probably the\n   best recommendation these days would be Harper's Bible Commentary.\n\nA slight dissent: I think the Harper's is "OK" but not great.  One\nparticular problem I have is that it tends to be pretty skimpy on\nbibliographic material.  My feeling is that it is OK for quick\nlook-ups, but not real useful for study in depth (e.g. I keep a copy\nin my office at work).\n\n   ... (I think there may be a couple of books with this title...\n\nSo far as I know there is the only one book with this exact title\n(James L Mays, general editor, Harper and ROw, 1988) although I think\nI recall a (older) series under the name "Harper Commentaries".  Also\nthere's a separate Harper's Bible Dictionary (most of my comments on\nthe HC also apply to the HBD.)\n\nMy favorite one-volume commentary is the "New Jerome Biblical\nCommentary".  The NJBC is rather Catholic in focus and somewhat biased\ntowards the NT.  (The reader can decide for her- or himself whether\nthese are pluses or minuses.)  In any case the scholarship is by and\nlarge excellent.\n\nNOTE: The NJBC is a completely reworked, updated version of the\n"Jerome Biblical Commentary", copies of which can still be found on\nsale.
I seldom see any posts in this group. Is anyone out there in Christendom\nlistening? If so, why don't we get some dialog going here?\n\nHere's a topic to get things started. My daughter's Christian school sends\nhome a weekly update on school related topics. This week they sent\nsomething *very* interesting. It was an article written by the leader of a\nnational (US) Christian school organization about a trip he recently made\nto Jerusalem. While there, he was introduced to one of the rabbis who is\nworking on a project to rebuild the Temple at Jerusalem. The article\nincluded photos of the many furnishings that have already been made in\npreparation for furnishing the rebuilt temple according to the\nspecifications given in the Bible. \n\nWhat was even more striking is the fact that the plans for the temple are\ncomplete and the group is only awaiting permission from the Israeli\ngovernment before beginning the building. The other startling fact is the\nvery recent archeological discovery that the original site of the temple is\nunoccupied and available for building. Previously it has been thought that\nthe original site was underneath what is now a mosque, making rebuilding\nimpossible without sparking a holy war. \n\nNow it appears that nothing stands in the way of rebuilding and resuming\nsacrifices, as the Scriptures indicate will happen in the last days.\nAlthough the Israeli government will give the permission to start, I think\nit is the hand of God holding the project until He is ready to let it\nhappen. Brothers and sisters, the time is at hand. Our redemption is\ndrawing near. Look up!
Please forgive all the inclusions. I suppose they are neccessary to follow\nthe argument.\n\nMy point is that "if life has meaning or importance then we should try\nto find that meaning or importance" which is almost a tautology. (I hope\nI'm not being too patronizing.) One term for that meaning is "Creator",\nthough that is not obvious from my above argument.\n\n\n(It's more like "I think, therefore I am, therefore God is.")\n\n\nUnfortunately the term "religious" is ambiguous to me in this context.\nI could say that searching for meaning in life is by definition being\nreligious. I could say cult followers by definition have given up on \nthe search.\n\nIf you want "meaning" why not search for the truth?\n\nSo far, my understanding of Christianity is congruent with my understanding\nof truth. There have been many before me who have come to conclusions \nthat are worded in ways that make sense to me. By no means does that imply\nthat I understand everything.
Where do insparations/Miracles fit in?  I was a new reader to the bible\nand Qu'ran at the same time in my life and I can tell you that I would \nhave drifted in my faith if Those books were not exposed to me.
Concerning Christians praying for coporate forgiveness of national sins, \nMichael Covington claims the following of C.S. Lewis:\n\n<><\n\nI was surprised when I heard this same kind of remark from a fellow grad. \nstudent I know, especially since he had seminary training.  I have read the \nsame essay and do not find Lewis making any such claim.  Rather, Lewis is \ncondemning the use of such coporate prayer efforts as platforms to make \npolitical jabs at opponents, feigned as confessions of guilt (ie., Lord please \nforgive us for allowing "insert political issue/idea/platform" to exist in our\ncountry, it is wrong and we ask your forgiveness.).  I would be interested in\nknowing what part of the essay you feel condemns national repentance (please\nquote).
Hi Damon,  No matter what system or explanation of creation you wish\nto accept, you always have to start with one of two premises, creation\nfrom nothing, or creation from something.  There are no other\nalternatives.  And if we accept one or the other of those two\npremises, then again there are two alternatives, either creation was\nrandom, or was according to some plan.\n   If it was random, I am unable to accept that the complex nature of\nour world with interrelated interdependent organisms and creatures\ncould exist as they do.  Therefore I am left with creation under the\ncontrol of an intelligence capable of devising such a scheme.  I call\nthat intelligence God.\n   I also prefer the "Creatio ex nihilo" rather than from chaos, as it\nis cleaner.\n   There is obviously no way to prove either or neither.  We are and\nwe must have come from somewhere.  Choose whatever explanation you\nfeel most comfortable with, Damon.  You are the one who has to live\nwith your choice.\nShalom,                                  Len Howard
Must there be a "why" to this?  I ask because of what you also\n     assume about God-- namely, that He just exists, with no "why"\n     to His existence.

The last sentence is ironic, since so many readers of\nsoc.religion.christian seem to not be embarrassed by apologists such as\nJosh McDowell and C.S. Lewis. The above also expresses a rather odd sense\nof history. What makes you think the masses in Aquinas' day, who were\nmostly illiterate, knew any more about rhetoric and logic than most people\ntoday? If writings from the period seem elevated consider that only the\ncream of the crop, so to speak, could read and write. If everyone in\nthe medieval period "knew the rules" it was a matter of uncritically\naccepting what they were told.\n\nBill Mayne

without active participation.  If you know the Latin, one really\n   beautiful way to hear the Passion is it's being chanted by three\n   deacons:  the Narrator chants in the middle baritone range, Jesus chants\n   in the bass, and others directly quoted are handled by a high tenor.\n\nI heard the Gregorian chant of the Passion on Good Friday.  In this\nliturgy, our Lord is definitely *very* sad.  It's as if He has\nresigned Himself to die for these poor pitiful creatures who are\nkilling Him.
Science does not progress via experimentation but by philosophising.  One\naim of experiments is to investigate the validity of the hyptheses\nresulting from the models produced by this thinking process.\n\n\nScience has one advantage of all other approaches to explaining the world.\nIt is objective.\n\n\nAnything which affects the physical world can be studied.  For example,\nsince we are part of the physical world, anything (including spirits) which\naffects our behaviour can be observed.  Science does not make any claims\nabout the existence or non-existence of objects which do not affect the\nphysical world.\n\n\nThe purpose of science is to produce a model of the *physical* world.  The\nmodel must be able to explain all past observations and predict the outcome\nof future observations.  One of the aims of experiments is to carry out\nwell defined observations which are objective.\n\nIdeally scientist will except the model which best describes the world, and\nthe model which realises on the minimal number of assumptions.  At the\nmoment models which do not rely on the assumption of some *spiritual* world\nexisting are equally powerful to ones which assume the assumption of a\n*spiritual* world.  As the non-spiritual models has fewer assumptions it\nshould be the currently accepted models.\n\nThe scientific process never assumes that its present models are the\ncorrect ones, whereas many religions claim to represent the truth.  The\narrogance of many theists is that they claim to represent the truth, this\ncannot be said of scientists.
Hi... I'm not a religious guy so dont take this as some kinda flame (thanx\nin advance)\n\nI want to know why there are so many different versions of the bible? There\n"....contains inaccurate data and inconsistencies."   \n\n					Thanx in advance... Shaz....\n\n[I'm not sure quite what you mean by many different versions.\nThe primary distinction in versions you see today is in the style\nof the translation.  It's pretty unusual to see significant\ndifferences in meaning.  There are a few differences in the underlying\ntext.  That's because before printing, manuscripts were copied by\nhand.  Slight differences resulted.  There are enough manuscripts\naround that scholars can do a pretty good job of recreating the\noriginal, but there are some uncertainties.  Fortunately, they are\ngenerally at the level of minor differences in wording.  There are\nsomething like 3 or 4 places where whole sentences are involved,\nbut with recent discoveries of older manuscripts, I don't think there's\nmuch uncertainly about those cases.  As far as I know, no Christians\nbelieve that the process of copying manuscripts or the process of\ntranslating is free of error.  But I also don't think there's\nenough uncertainty in establishing the text or translating it that\nit has much practical effect.\n\nWhether the Bible contains inaccurate data and inconsistences is a hot\ntopic of debate here.  Many Christians deny it.  Some accept it\n(though most would say that the inaccuracies involved are on details\nthat don't affect the faith).  But this has nothing to do with there\nbeing multiple versions.  The supposed inconsistences can be found in\nall the versions.  I'm surprised to find a reference to this on the\ntitle page though.  What version are you talking about?  I've been\nreferring to major scholarly translations.  These are what get\nreferenced in postings here and elsewhere.  There have certainly been\neditions that are (to be kind) less widely accepted.  This includes\neverything from reconstructions that combine parallel accounts into\nsingle narrations, to editions that omit material that the editor\nobjects to for some reason or the other.  The copyright on the Bible\nhas long since expired, so there nothing to stop people from making\neditions that do whatever wierd thing they want.  However the editions\nthat are widely used are carefully prepared by groups of scholars from\na variety of backgrounds, with lots of crosschecks.  I could imagine\none of the lesser-known editions claiming to have fixed up all\ninaccurate data and inconsistencies.  But if so, it's not any edition\nthat's widely used.  The widely used ones leave the text as is.\n(Weeeeelllllll, almost as is.  It's been alleged that a few\ntranslations have fudged a word or two here and there to minimize\ninconsistencies.  Because translation is not an exact science, there\nare always going to be differences in opinion over which word is best,\nI'm afraid.)
The proper term for what Mike expresses is Monophysitism.  This was a\nheresy that was condemned in the Council of Chalcedon in 451 AD.  It\ngrew up in reaction to Nestorianism, which held that the Son and Jesus\nare two different people who happened to be united in the same body\ntemporarily.  Monophysitism is held by the Copts of Egypt and Ethipoia\nand by the Jacobites of Syria and the Armenian Orthodox.  It believes\nthat Jesus Christ was God (which is correct), that he was man (which is\ncorrect), that he was one person (which is correct), but that he had\nonly one nature and one will and oen energy (which is heretical, the\northodox position is that he had two natures and two wills and two\nenergies, both divine and human, though the wills were in perfect\nharmony).  That is what Mike is trying to get across, that while Jesus\ncame in human form, Mike says He did not have a human nature or a human\nwill.  In reality, he had both, though neither made him subject to\noriginal sin.\nIt is interesting to note that the Monothelites were a reaction to this\nconflict and attempted to solve the problem by admitting two natures but\nnot two wills or two energies.  It also was condemned, at a late council\nin Constantinople I believe.\n\nAndy Byler
I am not so sure of Jewish proselytism then, but I would like to relate\nan account of a recent dinner I had with Jews a few months ago.\n\nThe dinner was instigated by the aunt of the hostess, whom I had met while\nvisiting my wife in Galveston last October.  The dear old aunt (now \ndeceased) was very proud of her Jewish heritage, although not especially\ndevout.  Her parents were both murdered in Nazi concentration camps in\nAustria during WWII because they were Jewish.  While conversing with her\nabout politics, world affairs and religion, she remarked that it would \nbe a good idea for me to visit her niece on my return to Atlanta.\n\nWithin two days of returning to Atlanta, her niece called to invite\nme over for dinner with her husband.  I went, not knowing really what to\nexpect, other than stimulating conversation and fellowship.  What I got,\nhowever, was rather unexpected.  The thrust of the evening's discussion\nwas to condemn the Reagan-Bush policies prohibiting abortion counseling \nin federally funded family planning clinics, prohibiting the sterilization\nof minorities on welfare here and in Puerto Rico, on\nthe ban on fetal tissue research, and against the Mexico City policy,\n"which denies U.S. foreign aid to programs overseas that promote abortion."\n\nThe crux of their position was to place the blame for the problems of\n"overpopulation," rampant domestic crime, African starvation, unwed\nmothers, etc., on Christianity, rather on the fall of Adam.  Now, this\nis not what I had to come to talk about.  But every time I tried to \nbring up the subject of Judaism, they would condemn Jews for Jesus\nand admonish me against converting to Judaism, "because it involves\ntoo much study and effort."  And I did not even raise the prospect, nor\ntry to convert them to the truth of Christ!  There was certainly no\nJewish proselytism going on there.\n\nAnd again, last November I toured a "traditional" Jewish synagogue and was\nsubjected to a 30-minute harangue against Jesus and Christianity in\ngeneral.  I realize that these are two isolated incidents, and that the\nbest supervisor I ever had at work is Jewish, but from my experience,\nthe modern Jew is not known for his proselytism.\n\n \n-- \nboundary
Hooray ! I always suspected that I was human too :-)  It is the desire to be like\nChrist that often causes christians to be very critical of themselves and other\nchristians. We are supposed to grow, mature, endeavour to be Christ-like but we\nare far far far from perfect. Build up the body of Christ, don't tear it down,\nand that includes yourself. Jesus loves me just the way I am today, tomorrow and\nalways (thank God ! :-).
I do recall Watt making a comment to this effect, though it was quite a few\nyears back and I can't cite the specifics.  I also recall that Cecil Andrus, who\nwas Secretary of the Interior during the Carter Administration, responded\nto Watt's comments by pointing out the stewardship role that God gave\nto man, as recorded in Genesis.  Which makes me wonder: who are the\ntrue conservatives?  It seems to me that a *conservative* should want to\n*conserve* things of value for long-term societal benefit.  This form of\n*conservation* should logically extend to the physical environment in \nwhich people live, as well as the moral environment in which they relate\nto one another and to God.\n\nIMHO, Watt's stewardship status is not enhanced by the fact that he served \non the board of directors for Jim Bakker's organization, during a time in \nwhich Bakker committed criminal acts which eventually landed Bakker \nin federal prison.
: It is a dead and useless faith which has no action behind it.  Actions\n: prove our faith and show the genuineness of it.\n\nA good example of this is Abraham (referred to in the James passage). Hebrews\nsays that Abraham was justified by faith -- but his faith was demonstrated\nthrough his works (i.e., he obeyed what God told him to do).\n\nReading Abraham's ``biography'' in Genesis is very instructive. He was a man\nbeset by *lack* of faith a lot of the time (e.g. lying about Sarah being his\nwife on 2 occasions; trying to fulfil God's promise on God's behalf by\ncopulating with Hagar). . . yet it seems that God didn't evaluate him on the\nbasis of individual incidents. Abraham is listed as one of the ``heroes of \nfaith'' in Hebrews 11. i.e., when it really came to the crunch, God declared\nAbraham as a man of faith. He believed God's promises.\n\nThis gives us confidence. Although real faith demonstrates itself through\nworks, God is not going to judge us according to our success/failure in\nperforming works.\n\n``Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to His mercy\nhe saved us, through the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy\nSpirit.'' (Titus 3.5)\n\nAmazing Grace! Hallelujah!
I'd like to remind people of the withering of the fig tree and Jesus\ndriving the money changers et. al. out of the temple.  I think those\nwere two instances of Christ showing anger (as part of His human side).
Most of you will have probably seen the news by the time you read this,\nbut the Branch Davidian compound is no more.  This morning about 6:00,\nthe feds punched holes in the compound walls by using a tank.  They \nthen started using non-lethal tear gas.  Shortly after noon, 2 cult\nmembers were seen setting fire to the compound.  So far, about 20-30\npeople have been seen outside the compound.  The fate of the other 60 or\n70 people is unknown, neither is the fate of the 17 children that were\ninside.  The compound did burn to the ground.\n\nKoresh, who at times has claimed to be the Messiah, but then backed off\nand only claimed to be a prophet, had promised several times to come\nout peacefully if his demands were met.  First, he demanded that his\nmessage be broadcast on the radio, which it was, but he didn't come out.\nHe claimed to be waiting for a message from God.  Finally, he said that\nGod told him that he needed to decipher the mystery of the 7 seals in\nRevelation, and when he was finished, he'd come out.  He finished the\nfirst one, but didn't do any more work that anyone knows of since then.\nThe federal agents did warn him that if they didn't come out, they \nwould be subjected to tear gas.\n\nI think it's really sad that so many people put their faith in a mere\nman, even if he did claim to be the son of God, and/or a prophet.  I\nthink it underscores the importance of putting you faith only in\nthings that are eternal and knowing for yourself what the Scriptures\nsay and what they mean, instead of relying on others to do it for you,\neven if those others are learned and mean well.
I would like to see Christians devote a bit less effort to _bashing_\npaganism and more to figuring out how to present the Gospel to pagans.\n\nChrist is the answer; the pagans have a lot of the right questions.\nUnlike materialists, who deny the need for any spirituality.
All of the arguments concerning the Sabbath ought to make the point\npretty clear - anyone outside of the Catholic or Orthodox orAnglican or\nMonophysite churches ourght to worship on Saturday if they are really\nsola scriptura.  Otherwise, they are following a law put into effect by\nthe Church, and only the above Chruches really recognize any power of\nthe Chruch to do so.\n\nAndy Byler\n\n[You will note that nothing in the FAQ said anything about the Church\nestablishing or changing a law.  The argument against the Sabbath is\nthat it is part of the ceremonial law, and like the rest of the\nceremonial law is not binding on Christians.  This argument is based\non Paul's letters, Acts, and in a more general sense, Jesus'\nteachings.  Further, most people argue that Scripture shows worship\noccuring on Sunday, and Paul endorsing it.  I understand that these\npoints are disputed, and do not want to go around the dispute one more\ntime.  The point I'm making here is not that these arguments are\nright, but that the backing they claim is Scripture.\n\nAccepting the principle of "sola scriptura" does not commit us to\nobeying the entire Jewish Law.  Acts 15 and Paul's letters are quite\nclear on that.  I think even the SDA's accept it.  The disagreement is\non where the Bible would have us place the line.\n\nBy the way, Protestants do give authority to the church, in matters\nthat are not dictated by God.  That's why churches are free to\ndetermine their own liturgies, church polity, etc.  If you accept that\nthe Sabbath is not binding on Christians, then the day of worship\nfalls into the category of items on which individual Christians or\n(since worship is by its nature a group activity) churches are free to\ndecide.
Firstly, I am an atheist. I am not posting here as an immature flame\nstart, but rather to express an opinion to my intended audience.\n\nThe meaning of my existence is a question I ask myself daily.  I live \nin fear of what will happen when I  die.   \n\nI bet some of you are licking your lips now, because you think that\nI'm a person on the edge of accepting jeezus.             \n\nI was raised in a religious atmosphere, and attended 13 years of\nreligious educational institutions..  I know the bible well. So well\nI can recognize many passages from memory.  \n\n<<****Strong opinions start here...****>>\n\n1) The human being is an _animal_ who has, due to his/her advanced\nmental facilities, developed religious as a satisfiable solution to\nexplain the unexplainable.  (For example the ancient Greeks believed\nthat Apollo drove his chariot across the sky each day was real.  Due\nto the advancement of our technology, we know this to be false.  \n\nChristianity is an infectious cult.  The reasons it flourishes are \nbecause 1) it gives people without hope or driven purpose in life\na safety blanked to hide behind.  "Oh wow..all i have to do is \nfollow this christian moral standard and I get eternal happiness."\nFor all of you "found jeezus" , how many of you were "on the brink?"\n\nbut i digress...   The other reason christianity flourishes is its\ninfectious nature.  A best friend of mine breifly entered a christian\ngroup and within months, they set ministry guidelines for him which\nbasicaly said this -->Priority #1 Spread the Word.\n\n\nWe are _just_ animals.  We need sleep, food, and we reproduce.  And we\ndie.      \n\nReligion (especially Christianity) is nothing more than a DRUG.\nSome people use drugs as an escape from reality.  Christians inject\nthemselves with jeezus and live with that high. \n\nIt pities me how many millions of lives have been lost in religious\nwars, of which Christianity has had no small part.\n\nWhen Christians see a "non-believer", they say that person is blind\nto the truth, but they cannot realize that it is _they_ who live\nwith this mask of fakeness each day.  Jesus was just prophet #37696 \nwho happened to have a large influence because at that time the Romans\nwere (circa 69ad) dispersing the Jewish population and communities\nneeded some sort of cohesive element to keep them strong in that time\nof dire need.\n\nI must go.  These are but a few of my thoughts on Christianity.
Just finished reading Burton Mack's new book, _The Lost Gospel, Q and Christian\nOrigins_.  I thought it was totally cool.  Anyone else read it and want to \ntalk?
We also cannot fail to note the intense suffering a devastation which has been\nwrecked on our world because of Christians -- who were certain they were\nfollowing Christ.  From Captialist who have polluted the enviorment in strict\nobedience to the Gensis command to subdue the earth, to Nazi's who have\n"justly"\npunished the Jews for the killing Christ (as well as the other progroms), the\ninnocent women who were burned alive in accordance with "you shall not allow a\nwitch to live", the Moslems who were killed in the Crusades, the god-fearing\nmen destroyed by the inquistion.  The religious wars in Spain, France, England,\netc.  Christianity has undoubtedly caused the most suffering and needless loss\nof life by individuals whose certainity that they were following the\ninstructions therein, was unquestionable.  There is much to grieve.
One rule of thumb is that if a person is making the claim, they are\nwrong.  I was just reading John 14 this morning (I think that is the\nright chapter, anyway it is close and I don't have a Bible at work to\ncheck with.) and in it Jesus is talking to his disciples about his\nimpending death and he says that he will be going away and then later\nhe will be with them.  He said something along the lines of "I will\nbe in you and you will be in me."  (Again I cannot provide the exact\nquote or citation.)  Anyway, my understanding of this is that\nthe Second Coming will not be an outward event.  It is an inward\nevent, Christ will come to live in our hearts and we will live in him.\nIf you look for a person you will be deceived.\n\nIt seems to me that the Jews had been looking for a Messiah that would\nbe a political or military leader and so didn't recognize Jesus when\nhe came.  Jesus tried to show that his Kingdom was not of this earth.\nA lot of what I have seen written about the Second Coming seems to\nbased on an expectation of Christ coming back and finally taking over\nthe world and running it the way it should be.  It sounds a lot like\nwhat the Jews were looking for.  The First Coming wasn't like that and\nI see no reason for the Second Coming to be like that either.\n\nOh and by the way, I don't expect it to happen once.  There is no one\nSecond Coming, there are a lot of little ones.  Every time Christ\ncomes into someones heart, Christ has come again.\n\nPeace,\nWill.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------
I apologize if this post isn't entirely appropriate for the newsgroup.\n\n   I would like to correspond with any Christians attending the University\nof Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.  I will be transfering there in August to\ncomplete my Ph.D. and I thought it would be nice to correspond with people\nbefore I moved out.
I originally wrote to the person who asked this question\npersonally, but decided to post the information I had on the topic.\n\n	I spoke to the pastor of my parish (Catholic) recently, \nby coincidence, on this subject.  His explaination was that \nwhile it is possible for a couple to marry without the presence\nof a priest, it is important to have it recognized by the \nChurch as soon as it is possible.  Because the Church \nrecoginizes itself as a community of believers, members\nof the church, to some degree, are to be held accountable\nto each other.  To be less hypothetical than that mythical\ncouple on the desert island, there are many places in the\nworld that do not have priests availible for marriages\non a regular basis.  Therefore, couples get married without\nthe priest being present, but get the priest to testify to\ntheir marriage when one comes through the area.  \n\n	I remember a religion teacher in high school saying\nthat the marriage ceremony is not for the benefit of the couple\nas much as it is for the benefit of the community.  Thus,\nmarried couples have some responsibility to the community\nto stay married, as divorce sets a bad example for the\ncommunity.  Also, the couple has vowed to become one with\none another--the community should be able to rely on that \ncouple to be as one.\n\n	While couples may marry without witnesses, they \nmay NOT get anulments without a priest present.  An \nanulment is simply an admission of the church that what\nthey had declared a marriage was not, in fact, a marriage\nat all, for whatever reason.  So don't start getting married\nin the back seat of a station wagon and giving yourselves\nanulments a half-hour later!!\n\n	I tend to agree with the response back there that\nsaid couples become married as soon as they consumate their\nmarriage, but I would add that couples should consider their\nmarriage consumated if they have sex, whether or not they\nintended to be married, assuming they were both willing\npartners to the sexual act.  The couple must be prepared\nto raise any children they may have as a result of that\nsexual act with the benefit of both parents.  Sex IS a\ncommitment, I believe, in God's eyes.\n\n	But I'm digressing....\n\n			God be with you,
On the question, "Does God hear the prayers of sinners?" we need to\ndistinguish.\n\nIf we say that He never hears the prayers of any who have sinned, we\nmake pointless all prayers by anyone born less than 19 centuries\nago.\n\nBut if we consider the prayers of the impenitent sinner, of someone\nwho says, "Lord, I want you to do this for me, but don't expect me\nto change my way of life," that is a different matter. Even here, I\nwould not venture to say that God never grants such petitions (just\nas He sends sun and rain on the evil and on the good). However, if\nsomeone we know well is praying to God in that spirit, we might have\nthe responsibility to say, "Remember, if God's help is real, then so\nare His commands."
In mentioning some nonsense about psychology :) and atheism, Bob Muir asks\nthe following question.   \n\n\nI answer in the affirmative.  Now this answer might sound a little\nintellectually dishonest to Bob, but I think I have been accused before\nof that heinous crime and am man enough to take it.  !-)  What thinking\nperson has not at one time or other been accused of it?   Is it\npolitically correct for Christians to be the only besieged group\npermitted the luxury of arrogance?   \n\nNow I have a question for Bob.  Why in the world would any self-respecting\natheist want to subscribe to a Christian news group?  I have a \ndifficult enough time keeping up with it, and I think I know something\nabout the subject.     \n\nBob reminds me of my roommate.  In order to disbelieve atheism, he says \nhe will need to be proven wrong about it.  Well, I don't even waste \nmy time trying.  I tell him that he'll just have to take my word for it. \nIn response, he tells me he will say an "atheist's prayer" for me. \n\nGood luck, Bob.  And, best regards.
My impression is that *for advanced work* you will be much better off with\nGerman reference works (lexicons, concordances especially).  For a first-time\nencounter, my *personal* preference would be to deal with a textbook written in\nmy native language.  But if you know German and are in Germany, pick up all the\nreference books you think you can handle.  (I only know these works by\nreputation, since my German is most rusty, but I'd look at the following books:\nKoehler's lexicon, Mandeldern's concordance, the Jenni & Westermann theological\ndictionary of the OT.)\n\n\nThe amount of language instruction available at US seminaries varies widely,\nmostly depending on the denominational heritage of the school.  Presbyterian\nand Reformed seminaries probably place a lot more emphasis on the biblical\nlanguages than others.  (Of course, any divinity school that has a doctoral\nprogram in biblical studies is going to have extensive language resources!  But\nthere are quite a few masters-degree-granting seminaries here at which the\nattitude seems to be more, "Well, if you're *really* interested we'll give you\na semester-long course, but we don't understand why . . .")
[More stuff deleted]\n\nThis seems to be a pretty arogant definition of belief.  My beliefs\nare those things which I find to be true based on my experience of the\nworld.  This experience includes study of things that I may not have\nexperienced directly.  But even then, I can only understand the\nstudies to the extent to which I can relate what I study back to what\nI have experienced.\n\nWhich means that by beliefs about God are directly related to my\nexperience of God.  Having experienced God, I try to make sense of\nthat experience.  I study religion and read the Bible.  I find things\nthat echo what I have already experienced.  Out of this I build my\nbeliefs.  I also find things that don't match my experience.  That\ndoesn't make them false.  They just don't match my experience.  Maybe\nI will understand that stuff later.  I don't know.  Maybe all of my\nbeliefs are wrong.  I can change my beliefs.\n\nIf someone else has beliefs that are different from mine, so what.\nNeither of us are necessarily wrong.  Someone else is making sense out\nof a different set of experiences.  Even though we have different\nexplanations and beliefs, if we talk we might even discover that the\nunderlying experiences are similar.\n\nSome people approach religion as a truth that can only exist in one\nform, and usually has a single revelation.  The more dogmatic and\ninflexible the belief system, the more arrogant it will appear to an\noutsider.  There is another approach possible, however.  God is a\nmystery.  I am trying to solve the mystery, so I look at the evidence\navailable to me.  I try to arrive at the best understanding that I can\nbased on the evidence.  New evidence may cause me to change my\nunderstanding.  When I encounter someone with a different belief than\nmy own, it isn't a threat, it is an opportunity to perhaps discover\nsomething new about this mystery I can never fully comprehend.\n\nPeace\nWill Taber\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------
I am curious if anyone in net-land has spent any time at any of the L'Abri\nhouses throughout the world and what the experience was like, how it affected\nyou, etc.  Especially interesting would be experiences at the original L'Abri\nin Switzerland and personal interactions with Francis and/or Edith Schaeffer.
(Reasoning pertinent to believing Xians deleted for space)\n\n      It strikes me, for no apparent reason, that this is reversible.\nI.e., if I had proof that there existed a hell, in which I would be\neternally punished for not believing in life, would that make me a Xian?\n(pardon my language) _Bloody_hell_no_!\n\n      ...Of course, being merely a reversal of your thinking, this\ndoesn't add anything _new_ to the debate, but...\n\n\n      A point very well taken, IMNSHO.

That would be neat, but nowhere in the Bible does it say\nthat one who has the gift of tounges can do this.  If the gift\nof tounges were the ability to be understood by everyone,\nno matter what languages they know, there would be no need for the\ngift of interpretation, and I Corinthians 14 would not have had to\nhave been written. \n\n\n\nThat's a pretty harsh assumption to make about a several million\nChristians world wide.  Sure, there are some who want glory\nfor themselves who speak in tounges, just as there are among those\nwho do not have this gift.  There were people like this in the Corinthian\nchurch also.  that does not mean that there is no true gift or that all\nwho speak in tounges do it for their own glory in the sight of men.  \nI would venture to say that a large percentage of those who do speak in tounges \ndo so more often in private prayer than in public.\n\nLink Hudson
Jesus isn't God ? When Jesus returns some people may miss Him ?  What version of\nthe Bible do you read Mike ?\n\nJesus is God incarnate (in flesh) . Jesus said, 'I and the Father are one.' \nJesus was taken up to heaven after His 40 day post-resurrection stint and the\nangels who were there assured the apostles that Jesus would return the same way\nand that everyone will see the coming. That's why Jesus warned that many would\ncome claiming to be Him but that we would know when Jesus actually returns. \n\nThese are two very large parts of my faith and you definitely hit a nerve :-)

Quoth the Moderator:\n\n\nIn a short poem ("God in His mercy made / the fixed pains of Hell"),\nC. S.

Here again, the problem with most of the individuals posting here, you take the\nbiblical account as though it were some sort of historical recounting in the\nmodern sense.  I would refer you to John Dominic Crossans Book _The Cross That\nSpoke_ (Pub. Harper and Row, 1988).  The earliest texts which we have make no\nreference to an empty tomb.  Nor is an empty tomb necessary for a claim of\nresurrection. Modern Evangelicals/Fundamentalists have completely missed what\nthe point of resurrection is -- Here the work of George Nickelsburg's work \n_Resurrection, Immortality, and Eternal Life in Intertestamental Judaism_ (Publ\nCambridge, Havard Univ. Press, 1972) is most helpful.  Look At Rom 1:1-3.  Paul\nhere has no need of an empty tomb.  Additionally in 1 Cor 15, Here again there\nis no mention of an empty tomb. He was raised (note the passive), he appeared,\nno ascension either.\n\nResurrection could be accomplished without ever disturbing the bones in the\ngrave.  The whole idea of an empty tomb isn't broached in any of our texts\nuntil well after the fall of Jerusalem.  By that time, the idea of coming up\nwith a body would have been ludicrious.  Moreover Mack has argued (convicingly,\nI think) that the empty tomb story first appears in Mark (we have no texts\nbefore this which mention the tomb). \n    \n\n\nYou are quite right here.  Even the Idea of a subjective mystical event as the\nfoundation of the resurrection narratives is currently becoming more untenable.\nSee B. Mack _A Myth of Innocence_.
I am a student at UW-Eau Claire.  I am doing a paper an witches and wanted to\nget your point of view.  I will not use you name unless you specifically tell\nme to do so.\n\nPlease answer this question:\n\nAs a Christian, are you offended by witches and Wiccan?  Do you feel that tehy\nare pagan in the evil sense of the word?\n\nYou time and cooperation is appreciated.  Thanks, J.\n\n-This survey is being conducted in partial fulfillment of the course\nrequirements for Engl 201, taught by Karen Welch at the University of\nWisconsin-Eau Claire.

Sure, why not? But, are you using Paul to correct the words of Jesus?\n\n\n"So *anyone* who dissolves even one of the smallest commands and teaches\nothers the same way, will be known as the lowest in the kingdom of the\nskies; whereas *anyone* who keeps the commands and teaches them too, will\nbe known as *someone* great in the kingdom of the skies." Mat5:19 (Gaus)\n\nAre you an "anyone" or are you a "no one?"\n\nWhy not assume, that since Jesus didn't say that his words apply only to\nJews, that they apply to all human beings, irregardless of race or sex?\n\nWhy not assume, that even though Jesus did not mention your name, still\nJesus was talking directly to you?\n\n\nDoes it say that it applies to *you*? Are you anyone or no one?\n\n\nEx20:8-11(JPS) Remember the sabbath day and keep it holy. Six days you\nshall labor and do all your work, but the seventh day is a sabbath of\nthe LORD your God; you shall not do any work - you, your son or\ndaughter, your male or female slave, or your cattle, or the stranger who\nis within your settlements. For in six days the LORD made heaven and\nearth and sea, and all that is in them, and He rested on the seventh\nday; therefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day and hollowed it.\n\nNote: There is no specific requirement for worship here, however I for\none would not be so bold as to call these verses a "ceremonial detail."\n\n\nDon't many Christians still practice circumcision?\n\n\nIt's unfortunate that Jesus didn't use your name directly, or maybe\nJesus did? Are you somebody or nobody?\n\n\nIf you don't see a problem, then perhaps there is none. As Paul closes\nRomans 14 (Gaus):\n\n  In short, pursue the ends of peace and of building each other up.\nDon't let dietary considerations undo the work of God. Everything may be\nclean, but it's evil for the person who eats it in an offensive spirit.\nBetter not to eat the meat or drink the wine or whatever else your\nbrother is offended by. As for the faith that you have, keep that\nbetween yourself and God. The person is in luck who doesn't condemn\nhimself for what he samples. On the other hand, the person with doubts\nabout something who eats it anyway is guilty, because he isn't acting on\nhis faith, and any failure to act on faith is a sin.
Maybe cyclical is not the best word.  That is one aspect of it.  In the\ncase of the virgin birth prophecy, it applied to the then and there, and\nalso prophetically to Christ.  The army that threatened the king would \ncease to be a threat in a very short time.  Yet it also prophecied of \nChrist.\n\nSeveral prophecies that refered to Christ also had application at the\ntime they were made.  "Out of Egypt have I called my Son" refers both\nto Israel, and prophetically to Christ.   "Why do the heathen rage"\nwas said of David and also of Christ.  \n\nAnother example would be the Scripture quoted of Judas, "and his bishoprick\nlet another take."  Another example is something that Isaiah said of His\ndisciples which is also applied to Christ in Hebrews, "the children thou\nhast given me."\n\nHow does the preterist view account for this phenomenon.\n\nLink
Strictly speaking, you're right - we can't repent _for_ somebody else,\nfor what they've done.  I guess I don't think it's out of line to talk\nabout a generalized repentence for our contribution to or participation\nin "The sins of society" , or for our tacit approval (by our silence) of\nsinful attitudes or practices....it may be that we're also just plain\nbegging for mercy, hoping God will withhold his hand of judgement on\nour whole country for the sake of a few, much as Abraham sought to do\nfor the sake of Lot.  (Hmmm, the results there were pretty cautionary...)\n\nA few times lately when I've observed some either out-and-out sinful \nactivity, or just some self-destructive activity, I've gotten a strong\nimpression that many folks really don't know any better.  Christ's pity\non the crowds as being "like sheep without a shepherd" rings true to me.\nIf these folks don't have a clue, do I bear _any_ responsibility for my\nnot having communicated a better way?  Worse still; have I expressed \njudgement and disgust at their doings, and thus alienated them from any \npositive relationship whereby I might pass along anything positive?  \nI _know_ I've got something to repent about on that score.\n\nAnyway, it's a real interesting question.
Always existing and being the source of the existence of all other beings\nis not problematic.\n\nBut, as you put, Being the source of "all" existence, including one's own,\nwould mean that God came from nothing, a concept alien to Christianity and\nTheism.  It is better to understand the classical concepts of Necessary and\nContingent existence.  God exists necessarily, always.  God created\ncontingent beings.  This is a coherent solution to existence, so long as\nthe concept of God is coherent.\n \n\nNot a very good answer.  If reason cannot by any means understand something\nthen it is likely that "it" is a null concept, something not in reality.
perhaps you can tell your friend that you feel pressured by his\ncontinual discussions of this topic -- surely he doesn't feel you\nshould be _pressured_ into something you feel uncomfortable about\n(since christianity should be a choice one should make on one's own).\nplease also realize that he is doing this out of friendship -- he\nprobably feels you are missing out on something great, and wants to\ntell you about it.  but since you know where you can learn about\nchristianity, you can tell him that it is now up to you to make that\nchoice, and if the choice is no, you should be respected for that.\npersonally i believe that a christian's mission is just to be\nchrist-like, showing his/her own faith and happiness in that faith,\nand make sure people know they are welcome to talk to you about it.  i\ndo not believe in imposing your beliefs upon others -- but then again\neveryone's definitions of "imposing" may differ.
True to a point.  If you were to ask a Buddhist atheist...\n\n\n\nActually, yes and no, Hell is eternal death.  Actually, the way \n     I've had it related to me, it's more of an eternal damnation,\n     where sinners will feel the licking flames of Hell.  If I\n     supposedly can feel these flames, I would assume I'm still\n     alive, but suffering and away from God.\n\n\nI believe Jehovah's Witnesses have a similar view, where the body\n     sleeps for ever...\n\nI don't have a problem with being condemned to Hell either.  The\n     way I see it, if God wants to punish me for being honest in\n     my skepticism (that is, for saying he doesn't exist), He\n     certainly wouldn't be changing His nature.  Besides, I would\n     rather spend an eternity in Hell than be beside God in Heaven\n     knowing even one man would spend his "eternal life" being\n     scorched for his wrongdoings...\n\nStephen\n\n    _/_/_/_/  _/_/_/_/   _/       _/    * Atheist\n   _/        _/    _/   _/ _/ _/ _/     * Libertarian\n  _/_/_/_/  _/_/_/_/   _/   _/  _/      * Pro-individuality\n       _/  _/     _/  _/       _/       * Pro-responsibility\n_/_/_/_/  _/      _/ _/       _/ Jr.    * and all that jazz...
I'm not surprised that you see no wisdom in them.  That is because your\npremises are wrong from the word "Go".  You claim that Christianity is\nbased on blind faith, but this simply is not so.  Just look at the\ncurrent thread on the evidence for Jesus' resurrection for evidence\nthat Jesus was real and that he triumphed over death.\n\nFurthermore, you say that Christians hold to their beliefs "regardless of\nany evidence that you may find to the contrary."  Without any evidence\nto support your claim, this statement is little more than an ad hominem \nargument.\n\nMind you, I don't mean this as a personal attack.  I'm merely pointing out\nthe intellectual dishonesty behind condemning Christianity in this fashion.\nIt would make much more sense if you could prove that all Christians do \nbase their belief on empty nothings, and that they do ignore all evidence to \nthe contrary.  Only then can you expect your attack to make sense.
Could anyone enlighten me on how the Mormon church views \nchildren born out of wedlock?  In particular I'm interested to know if any \nstigma is attached to the children as opposed to the parents.

Phew! That takes a load off. I don't want to live forever.  I wish\nmost Christians held this view.  You can't walk across campus in\nspring without being assailed by fire-and-brimstone preachers.  I\nreally think the metaphor should be limited, at least with respect to\nteaching our children.  It's criminal to put these ideas into a young\nand trusting mind.  Besides, why not rely on the positive aspects of\nyour religion to win their faith?\n \n-Tim
Having met Peter Kingston (of WBT) some years back, he struck me \nas an exemplery and dedicated Christian whose main concern was with\ntranslation of the Word of God and the welfare of the people\ngroup he was serving.\nWBT literature is concerned mainly with providing Scripture\nin minority languages.\n\nThe sort of criticism leveled at an organisation such as this\nalong the lines of "ideological manipulation and cultural\ninterference" is probably no more than Christianising and\neducation - in this WBT will stand alongside the early Christian\nmissionaries to parts of Africa, or those groups who worked\namong native Americans a couple hundred years ago.\n\nI think you need to substantiate these attacks as being a\nlegitimate criticism of priorities other than spreading the\ngospel among underdeveloped people.

This is a ridiculous argument for being a Christian.  So then, you might \nconsider switching from Christianity to another religion if you were \noffered an even more frightening description of another hell?  How many\nChristians do think there are who view it strictly as an insurance policy?\nNot many I know; they believe in a message of love and compassion for \nothers.  A faith based on fear of hell sounds like a dysfunctional \nrelationship with God.  Like a child who cringes in fear of a parent's\nphysical violence.  \n\nMany religions have concrete views of heaven and hell, with various\nthreats and persuasions regarding who will go where.  Competition over\nwho can envison the worst hell can hardly nurture the idea of loving\nyour neighbor as yourself.
How much better to get wisdom than gold, to choose understanding rather\nthan silver!
I question the implications of this statement; namely, that there are certain\nphysical acts which are limited to God and that attempting to replicate these\nacts is blasphemy against God.  God caused a bush to burn without being\nconsumed--if I do the same thing, am I usurping God's role?  \n  Religious people are threatened by science because it has been systematically\nremoving the physical "proofs" of God's existence.  As time goes on we have to\nrely more and more on faith and the spiritual world to relate to God becuase\nscience is removing our props.  I don't think this is a bad thing.
The God of peace will soon crush Satan under your feet. \n    The grace of our Lord Jesus be with you. \nRomans 16:20
Cloak yourself in God's sustaining and abiding love. Pray, pray, pray.\nPray for your brother, that he will assume the Godly role that is his.\nPray for your sister-in-law, the what ever is driving her to separate\nyour brother and herself from the the rest of the family will be healed.\nPray for God to give you the peace in the knowledge that you may not be\nable to 'fix' it. From your description it would appear that it will\nrequire devine intervention, and the realization by your brother as to\nwhat his responsibilities are. Seek Godly counsel from your pastor, or\nother spiritually mature believer. Know always that He is akways there\nas a conforter, and will give you wisdon and direction as you call on\nHim.
Sorry, but I think this interpretation of the Matthew 13 parables is\nnonsense. I.e.,\n\n\nMatthew 16:12 explains that by "leaven of the Pharisees" Jesus was simply\nreferring to their teaching; not sin/corruption/heresy.\n\nJesus gaves His apostles the keys of the kingdom and said that\nthe gates of hell would not prevail against His church.
From article <Apr.15.00.58.22.1993.28891@athos.rutgers.edu>, by ruthless@panix.com (Ruth Ditucci):\n\nI do hope that you are not suggesting that merely because a person\nreplies in an "acrid, angry and sarcastic" manner that this\ndemonstrates their 'non-christianity'?  The simple fact is that there\nis not a Christian on the face of the planet (that I know of!) that is\nperfect.  I have been known at times to have a fit of temper, or a\nsulk, but this does not make me any the less a Christian.\n\nOne of the points of being a Christian (as I perceive it) is to become\nMORE LIKE Christ.  This statement inherently suggests that we ARE NOT\nalready like Christ.  Jesus never unrighteously lost his temper.  I\ndo.  Jesus was perfect.  I'm not.\n\n\nYou must understand that this is because Christians often forget to\ntreat others as our role-model - Christ - would.  This is because we are\nhuman and falible.  I, for one, do not pretend to be infalible, and I\nhope that my fellow-men will bear with me when I make mistakes.  This\nsurely is not too much to ask, when I make every effort to bear with\n_them_.\n\n\n\nAnd don't we know it!\n\n\nAgain I say, we are ALL human!\n\nTo my brethren, this:  \n\nMs Duticci has a valid point and we as Christians ought to heed the\nwarning in her article.  We oftimes discredit ourselves and our\nSaviour, in the way that we treat others.  Strive towards the goal set\nus by our Lord, but in the meantime, remember :\n\n     "There is no condemnation for those who are in Christ..."\n\nWhen you blow it - go easy on yourself.  Forgive yourself, as your\nFather in heaven forgives you!  And remember - and this is something I\nfirmly beieve and cling to - one day, we shall see Him face to face,\nand in that day, we shall (finally!) be perfected.  \n\nI look forward to seeing you there.\n\n\n     RRRRR        OO       BBBBB          :\n     R    R     OO  OO     B    B         :\n     R     R   OO    OO    B    BB        :          Robert Pomeroy\n     R   RR    O      O    B    B         :\n     RRRR      O      O    BBBBB          :    u2i02@teach.cs.keele.ac.uk\n     R  R      O      O    B    B         :\n     R   R     OO    OO    B    BB        :              1993\n     R    R     OO  OO     B    B         :\n     R     R      OO       BBBBB          :\n\n\nPS  If you want to draw anything to my attention, then please mail me\ndirect, because I don't often read the news...
Another issue of importance.  Was the crucification the will of God or\na tragic mistake.  I believe it was a tragic mistake.  God's will can\nnever be accomplished through the disbelief of man.  Jesus came to\nthis world to build the kingdom of heaven on the earth.  He\ndesperately wanted the Jewish people to accept him as the Messiah.  If\nthe crucification was the will of God how could Jesus pray that this\ncup pass from him.  Was this out of weakness.  NEVER.  Many men and\nwomen have given their lives for their country or other noble causes.\nIs Jesus less than these.  No he is not.  He knew the crucification\nwas NOT the will of GOD.  God's will was that the Jewish people accept\nJesus as the Messiah and that the kingdom of Heaven be established on\nthe earth with Jesus as it's head. (Just like the Jewish people\nexpected). If this had happened 2000 years ago can you imagine what\nkind of world we would live in today.  It would be a very different\nworld.  And that is eactly what GOD wanted.  Men and women of that age\ncould have been saved by following the living Messiah while he was on\nthe earth.  Jesus could have established a sinless lineage that would\nhave continued his reign after his ascension to the spiritual world to\nlive with GOD.  Now the kingdom of heaven on the earth will have to\nwait for Christ's return.  But when he returns will he be recognized\nand will he find faith on this earth.  Isn't it about time for his\nreturn.  It's been almost 2000 years.\n\nMike\n\n\n\nAnd the two simplest refutations are these:\n\n(1)  What impact?  The only record of impact comes from the New Testament.\nI have no guarantee that its books are in the least accurate, and that\nthe recorded "impact" actually happened.  I find it interesting that no other\ncontemporary source records an eclipse, an earthquake, a temple curtain\nbeing torn, etc.  The earliest written claim we have of Jesus' resurrection\nis from the Pauline epistles, none of which were written sooner than 20 years\nafter the supposed event.\n\n(2)  It seems probable that no one displayed the body of Jesus because no\none knew where it was.  I personally believe that the most likely\nexplanation was that the body was stolen (by disciples, or by graverobbers).\nDon't bother with the point about the guards ... it only appears in one\ngospel, and seems like exactly the sort of thing early Christians might make\nup in order to counter the grave-robbing charge.  The New Testament does\nrecord that Jews believed the body had been stolen.  If there were really\nguards, they could not have effectively made this claim, as they did.
04 Apr 93, David Cruz-Uribe writes to All:\n\n DC> Also, what is Orthodox practice regarding communion?  I read\n DC> a throw-away remark someplace that the Orthodox receive less\n DC> frequently than Catholics do, but was is their current practice?\n DC> Have their been any variations historically?\n\nI think Orthodox practice varies from place to place, from parish to parish and from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. In some parishes here in South Africa the only ones who receive communion are infants (i.e. children under\n 7). In our parish it is expected that one will have been to Vespers and confessional prayers the evening before, and that one will have been fasting. As we have to travel 70km to the church, we don'\nt receive communion every Sunday, but about every third Sunday.\n\nSteve
was condemned. So the Coptic Orthodox Church does not >believe in\nMonophysitism.\n\nSorry!\n\nWhat does the Coptic Church believe about the will and energy of Christ?\n Were there one or were there two (i.e. Human and Divine) wills and\nenergies in Him.\n\nAlso, what is the objection ot the Copts with the Pope of Rome (i.e. why\nis there a Coptic Catholic Church)?  Do you reject the supreme\njurisdiction of the 263rd sucessor of St. Peter (who blessed St. John\nMark, Bishop of Alexandria was translator for) and his predecessors?  Or\nhis infallibility?  Or what other things perhaps?
I'm waiting for an RC to speak up ! 8-)\nNobody has, so I will...\n\nThose with Bibles on hand can give the exact chapter & verse...\nAt the time Jesus told Peter that he was the "rock", He said\nwhatever you hold true on earth is held true in heaven, and \nwhatever you don't hold true won't be true in heaven.\n\nTherefore, with respect to marriage, the ceremony has to be\ndone by an RC priest. No big parties required. Just the priest,\nthe couple and witnesses. "Divorce" is not allowed. But anullments\nare granted upon approval by either the bishop or the Pope \n(not sure if the Pope delegates this function).\n\n--
I dreamed that the great judgment morning had dawned,\n     and the trumpet had blown.\nI dreamed that the sinners had gathered for judgment\n     before the white throne.\nOh what weeping and wailing as the lost were told of their fate.\nThey cried for the rock and the mountains.\nThey prayed, but their prayers were too late.\nThe soul that had put off salvation, \n"Not tonight I'll get saved by and by.\n No time now to think of ....... religion," \nAlas, he had found time to die.\nAnd I saw a Great White Throne.\n\nNow, some have protest by saying that the fear of hell is not good for\nmotivation, yet Jesus thought it was.  Paul thought it was.  Paul said, \n"Knowing therefore, the terror of the Lord, we persuade men."\n\nToday, too much of our evangelism is nothing but soft soap and some of\nit is nothing but evangelical salesmanship.  We don't tell people anymore, that\nthere's such a thing as sin or that there's such a place as hell.  \n\nAs Jayne has said, this doesn't mean we have to come on so strong so as to hit\npeople over the head with a baseball bat.  Yet the fact remains, there is a\nplace called hell.  A place so fearful that God died to save us from having to\nexperience it.  Whatever you or I, as Christians, do, we should do whatever we\ncan to win people to the Lord, if for no other reason, to keep them from going\nto "outer darkness.".  \n\nJesus, in Mt. 25, tells us that He didn't prepare hell for people.  He prepared\nit for the Devil and his angels.  No where in the Bible do I read -anywhere,\nthat God predestined anybody to go to hell.  D.L. Moody use to say that the\nelect are the "whosoever will" and the nonelect are the "whosoever wont's." \nWhether or not that's theologically sound, I couldn't defend, but its\npractical.  Jesus said to the people of Israel, "Ye would not."  \n\nNow, some of you may not be students of the Bible, heck -some of you may not be\nChristians.  Have you ever said to somebody, "I don't believe in hell.  I\nbelieve in the religion of Jesus."  But did you know that Jesus talked more\nabout hell than He did about heaven!  "Oh I believe in the religion of the\nsermon on the mount."  You find hell taught by Jesus in the sermon on the\nmount.  You'll read that Jesus talked about the tree being cast into the fire. \nSeveral times he talks about hell and about judgment.  In fact, over and over\nin the synoptics, Matthew, Mark and Luke, Jesus talks about hell.  Not Isaiah. \nNot Moses.  Not John the Baptist, though he did, but Jesus, the Son of God. \nThe great Beloved One preached about hell because He loved people and didn't\nwant to see them go there.\n\nNow, if there is no hell then Jesus preached in vain.  It was our Lord Jesus,\nnot some angry Baptist preacher, that said, "where the worm never dies, and\nwhere the fire never goes out."  Jesus said that.  It was Jesus who called hell\na "furnace of fire."  It was Jesus that used the word, "condemnation."  "And\nthis is the condemnation, that men love darkness rather than light because\ntheir deeds are evil.  Jesus said that.  \n\nHow can we get it across to you that a loving, dying Jesus preached about hell?\n Not only that, but He went through hell.  That's what Calgary was all about. \nWhen my Lord was on the cross, darkness fell.  He called hell, "outer\ndarkness."  \n\nDo you have this idea that hell is a place where the gamblers are gambling over\nhere, the drunks are getting drunk over there, and the prostitutes are\nprostituting their bodies over there?  That's not what hell is.  Hell's not a\nparty.  There's no fellowship there.  He called it "outer darkness."  "Outer"\n-away from God.  "Darkness" -God is light.  \n\nNo when He was on the cross, He was made sin for you and for me.  God treated\nJesus the way sinners have to be treated.  That's is a sobering thought.  As my\nson would say, an "awesome" thought.  \n\n"My God, My God why hast Thou forsaken me?"  Hell is isolation.  There's no\nfellowship in hell.  There's no friendship in hell.  There's no loving embrace\nin hell.  There's no hand shake in hell.  There's no word of encouragement in\nhell.  \n\n"I thirst."  It goes much deeper than physical thirst.  Hell is eternal craving\nwith no satisfaction.  The man whose life was lived for drugs, will crave it\neternally.  The man whose life was lived for the lust of a woman's body, will\ncrave it eternally -and not be satisfied.  One theologian has put it this way\nand I think it deserves merit.  What is hell?  Hell is just the kind of\nenvironment that matches the internal condition of the lost.  \n\nIn a recent post, I was trying to remember the founder of The Word of Life\nministries.  I've remembered his name, Jack Wertzen, and found that the\nillustration that I gave wasn't his.  His illustration was that he was talking\nto his barber and his barber's wife and daughter had just recently been saved\nand he was commenting about it to Jack.  "They sing these songs and read Bible\nverses, and their praising this and that -I can't stand it!  Jack, do you think\nGod would send me to hell?"  Jack answered by saying, "Yes I think he would!" \nOf course the barber said, "What do you mean by that."  "Well if you can't\nstand living at home with your wife and daughter who sing hymns and praises to\nGod now, what would you do in heaven where they'll do it for eternity?  You'd\nbe miserable.  Because God loves you, He'd put you where it would match what\nyou really are."   It makes a man think.\n\nThe crucifixion of Jesus Christ is a fact that necessitates the eternal\nexistence of hell because on the cross He performed an eternal act.  Don't ask\nme how, I don't know.  But He is God and He is the infinite/eternal and when He\ndied, He died an infinite/eternal death.  It is by that eternal act that He\npurchased eternal life for the "whosoever wills."  He suffered eternal\njudgment.  \n\nA lot of people would like to detour around hell by saying "Everybody is going\nto be saved eventually."  -universalism.  My Bible says no, He'll separate\nthem.  The sheep from the goats.  ".After you die there's a probationary period\nin which God prepares you for heaven."  No, my Bible says that "It is appointed\nunto men once to die and then comes judgment."  Some of the cultist believe in\nannihilation.  After you die, sssswish.  Just like a mosquito you're squished\nout.  No, in Rev we are told that their is eternal existence in hell just as\nthere is in heaven.  \n\nI don't enjoy making these kind of statements and maybe you don't enjoy\nlistening to them, but we have to preach the entire Word of God.  -There is a\nplace called hell.  If I could give one verse of Scripture that could give any\nhope that people aren't going there, I'd give it to you, but I haven't found\nit.  That fact that there is a place called hell, the fact that our God is a\nGod of holiness and must judge sin, the fact that He has made us the kind of\ncreatures we are and therefore we're responsible, the fact that He has placed\nus in a "uni"verse that has purpose and design behind it, the fact that sin is\nsuch an awful thing and the fact that God Himself went through hell to save us\nfrom hell leads us to two applications.\n\n1)  As I've already mentioned.  If you are a Christian, you must worn others. \nIts not good enough to stop and fix their flat tire and not tell them that just\naround the bend the bridge is out.  "Knowing therefore the terror of Lord, we\npersuade men."\n\n2)  If you haven't accepted Jesus are your Savior, you're taking an awful\nchance.  As I say to the Jehovah Witnesses (who no longer frequent my door), if\nyou are right and I am wrong, then I will have lived a good life and will die\nand cease to exist, but if I am right and you are wrong, then you will die and\nsuffer eternal damnation.  I don't mean to make fun at this point, but its like\nDirty Harry said, "You've got to ask yourself, 'Do I feel lucky?'  Well do\nyou?"  "A man's got to know his limitations."  Don't be one of the "whosoever\nwont's."
excellent question timothy. i hpoe the answers you get will be satisfactory  \nas we can not understand the mind of god. but to attempt to answer you  \nclearly. GOD of the Bible has given us humans relativly little about how he  \nintends to judge mankind. the first test is those who have beleived that Jesus  \nChrist is the Son of GOD and that his death and resurrection was sufficent to  \nserve justice for all the acts we commit that are wrong in the eyes of god,  \nthe bible calls this sin. for those who die before the end of the world/have  \nalready died it is more complicated to explain without lapsing in to cliche.\n  God must judge people on the baasis of their works in this world. however  \nthere is no plus and minus system for GOD. he has declared that he can not  \ntolerate spiritual imperfection, thus he can only based your worthiness to  \nlive with him on the wrong in your life. \n  Good people, yes even Christians are going to constantly sin before GOD, The  \nChristian hoever thanks GOD that Christ has given his life for his sin's  \npenalty. the proscribed punishment for sin is death, just as the proscribed  \npunishment for robbery is time in jail. God then cannot ask for anything but  \npunishement for those sins. He does not want to condem. the Bible says in John  \n3:17, that God did not send his son in to the word to condem it but that  \nthrough him it might be saved." when i realize that i have sinned, and i do  \nwith painful regularity, i must approach GOD and ask him to not hold thew sin  \nagainst me, i have that right and privlige only because of Christ. as for Jews  \nthey are promised that they must believe on the Messiah who would come, and  \ndis come in Jesus of Nazereth. Muslims, i fear have been given a lie from the  \nfater of lies, Satan. They need Christ as do us all.\n  for those who don't have that right, in the view of the bible they stand  \nolone in their defense. are you going to hell? i can not answer that for you.  \ni can only say that perhaps it is eaiser to ask and answer how can i not go to  \nHell? that step is much more rewarding.\n\nstan toney stoney@oyster.smcm.edu\nmy opinions are my own, you may borrow them
Jim,\n\nPlease feel free to correct me and give me some texts.  As far as I can see the\nonly text which vaugely relates to jewish evangelism is found in Mt. 23:15.\nHowever since this is found only in Mt. it cannot be dated before 90CE which\nmakes it unusefull for understanding Second Temple Judaism.
Dear Tim:\n\nYou say that you were a "catholic," but if you do not believe in the Christian\nGod (I suppose that means the God of the Bible) and publicly state this,   \nyou are in all probability not a Roman Catholic.  "Public heretics, even\nthose who err in good faith (material heretics), do not belong to the body\nof the Church" (Fundamentals of Catholic Dogma, 1960, Ludwig Ott, p. 311).\n\nAll is not lost, however, as you still might belong spiritually to the\nChurch by your desire to belong to it.  As you said, only God can judge\nthe condition of a man's soul.  About judgment, on the other hand, St. Paul \n1 Cor 5:12) urges Christians to judge their fellow Christians. \nFollowing the Apostle's teaching, I judge that you should reconsider   \nreturning to the Christian fold and embrace the God of Abraham, Isaac,\nand Jacob.  He is the God who lives.  \n\nConcerning what you were told about non-believers when you were a catholic,\nthat is true.  As I have posted before, Vatican II (Lumen Gentium, II,   \nn. 16) teaches: "Those who, through no fault of their own, do not know\nthe Gospel of Christ or His Chruch, but who nevertheless seek God with a\nsincere heart, and moved by grace, try in their actions to do His will\nas they know it through the dictates of their conscience - those too may\nachieve eternal salvation."  \n\nResponding to your solicitation for opinions on the thinking processes\nof God, the best I can do is refer you to Scripture.  Scripture is one\nof the best sources for learning what can be known about God.  \n\nStick with the best.\n-- \nboundary, the catechist
Regarding David Wilkerson's prophecies.  While I'm not real sure of\nhis credibility, I do remember a book he wrote, called A VISION or\nsomething like that.  He made a prediction that people who bought gold\nwould be hurt financially.  At the time, gold was up to about $800;\nnow it is less than half that.  This prediction stuck in my mind\nbecause a lot of people where I worked were buying gold.\n\nThe problem is, we tend to remember predictions that come true and\nforget ones that didn't (a la Jean Dixon).  Does anyone know if there\nany of his predictions, perhaps from the book I mentioned, that can\npretty definitely be said to have not come true?
[why are atheists atheists/ believes it could be the result of\n"brokenness"]\n\n\ni agree -- if you are going to find out anything from people who don't\nshare your beliefs, do not attack them or condescend to them and hope\nto get a neutral picture of them.  come to them with an open mind.\n\n\nwell, you do believe in something, as i see it, even if it is a sort\nof "anti-belief" (no negative connotation meant; i mean simply that\nyou believe that God _does not_ exist).  christians can also feel that\nsense of "difference", however, when they are associated with "those\nweird televangelists who always talk about satan".  if you'll excuse\nthe cliched sound of this, everyone has to deal with his/ her\ndifferences from other people.  i can understand how being an atheist\ncould be hard for you; being a christian is sometimes hard for me.\n\n\nyou should not have to repress how you feel -- you should be able to\ndiscuss it without fear.  i think there are admirable things to learn\nfrom any belief, which can enrich your own -- by asking myself the\nquestions that atheists may ask me, i can learn the answers and become\nstronger in my faith.  if my faith can't support knowing the answers\nto those questions, it is weak and untrue. \n\n\nin some way the pressures were different, of course, because you\n"chose" your beliefs -- or are you saying that they were not your\nchoice, but born of necessity?  [please, no flames about whether or\nnot gay people "choose" their lifestyle -- that's elsewhere in this\nnewsgroup]\n\n\ni'm not sure i understand this sentence -- could you explain?\n\n[moderator points out that many/ most atheists aren't "hostile", they\njust cease believiing in xiantiy/ religion]\n\n\nouch, yes.  part of being a christian is accepting _everyone_ with an\nopen heart -- including people of "our own camp" with whom we\ncompletely disagree.  by the same token, i believe that accusation and\nsuspicion are not the best way to reach out to those not of our faith,\nnor is it effective to try to browbeat people into accepting our\nreligion.  i have a different idea of mission: be what i am, a\nchristian who is happy in her faith, and if others see that and want\nto know about either the happiness or the religion, i'll share what i\nknow without pressure and let them make their own decisions.  at some\npoint you just have to agree to disagree -- acceptance of diversity,\nnot uniformity, is the way to sow peace....\n\n\nvera noyes
[4) "Nothing unclean shall enter [heaven]" (Rev. 21.27). Therefore,\nbabies are born in such a state that should they die, they are cuf off\nfrom God and put in hell, which is exactly the doctrine of St. Augustine\nand St. Thomas.  Of coures, having only original sins on thier souls,\nthey suffer the lightest punishment, the loss of the vision oand\npresence of God, but that does not change the undeniable fact that they\ncannot possibly come to a forgivenss of original sin, nor can they\ninherit eternal life.  "That," as St. Augustine said, "Is what the\nPelagian heretics taught."  Which is why he said later, "If you want to\nbe a Christian, do not teach that unbaptized infants can come to a\nforgivenss of original sin."]
If I don't think my belief is right and everyone else's belief is wrong,\nthen I don't have a belief. This is simply what belief means. Where does\nthe authority for a belief come from? Nowhere, for a belief is itself\nauthoratative. If I produce authority for a belief, where will I find\nauthority for my belief in the legitimacy of the authority. In short, \nthe mind has to start somewhere. (By the way, the majority of Christians,\ni.e. Catholics, believe in the authority of the Church, and derive the\nauthority of the Bible from its acceptance by the Church.)
[a lot of stuff deleted]\n\n:      For that matter, stay Biblical and call it Omar Rasheet (The Feast of\n: First Fruits).  Torah commands that this be observed on the day following\n: the Sabbath of Passover week.  (Sunday by any other name in modern\n: parlance.)  Why is there so much objection to observing the Resurrection\n: on the 1st day of the week on which it actually occured?  Why jump it all\n: over the calendar the way Easter does?  Why not just go with the Sunday\n: following Passover the way the Bible has it?  Why seek after unbiblical\n: methods?\n:  \nIn fact, that is the reason Easter "jumps all over the calendar"- Passsover\nitself is a lunar holiday, not a solar one, and thus falls over a wide\npossible span of times.  The few times that Easter does not fall during or\nafter Passover are because Easter is further linked to the Vernal Equinox-\nthe beginning of spring.\n\n[more deletions]\n:  \n:       So what does this question have to do with Easter (the whore\n: goddess)?  I am all for celebrating the Resurrection.  Just keep that\n: whore out of the discussion.\n:  \nYour obsession with the term "whore" clouds your argument.  "Whore" is\na value judgement, not a descriptive term.\n\n[more deletions]\n\nOverall, this argument is an illustration of the "etymological fallacy"\n(see J.P. Louw: _Semantics of NT Greek_).  That is the idea that the true\nmeaning of a word lies in its origins and linguistic form.  In fact, our\nown experience demonstrates that the meaning of a word is bound up with\nhow it is _used_, not where it came from.  Very few modern people would\nmake any connection whatsoever between "Easter" and "Ishtar."  If Daniel\nSeagard does, then for him it has that meaning.  But that is a highly\nidiosyncratic "meaning," and not one that needs much refutation.
I was wondering if anyone knew any changes to the temple\nceremony within the last fifty years....\nAlso, why do you think they were made (revelation, \nassimilation to mainstream Christianity, etc.)?\nI know that the God Makers was published quite a while\nago.  Could rituals have been changed since then?\n\nI am also very interested in the influence of Freemasonry\non early Mormonism, especially in the Smith family and \nin the Nauvoo settlement.

Yes, he was.  He also played Jesus in "Jesus Christ Superstar" before \nhe became a Christian.  He played in Black Sabbath right after he first \ngot saved, but then left it.
Pardon me for being a little confused, but at the beginning of your second \nparagraph, you say, "God has one set of rules for all his people," yet at the \nend of the same paragraph you declare, "please do not combine the ceremonial \nand moral laws in one."  Not only do I not understand where in the Bible you \nfind the declaration that there are 2 laws (ceremonial and moral), but I am \nalso unclear on whether you think it is bad to have 2 sets of laws in the first \nplace.  If it's bad to have 2 sets of laws, how can there be a ceremonial law \nthat is different from the moral law (and vice versa)?\n\nI would also be interested in your comments on the passage in I Cor. 10:1-16, \nwhere Paul teaches different rules for covering you head while praying \ndepending on whether you are a man or a woman.  Do you think the apostles can \nprescribe different sets of rules for men and women?  If so, then why not for \nJews and Gentiles?  Also, why did Paul, who was so opposed to circumcising \nGentiles, voluntarily circumcise Timothy?
Why should he have been any different "then"? Ozzy Osbourne,\nex-singer and main character of the Black Sabbath of good ole days past,\nis and always was a devout catholic. Or so I've heard over on the\nalt.rock-n-roll.metal newsgroups, an' I figure those folks oughta know..
Hello src readers,\n\nAgain the misconception that Copts among other Oriental Orthodox\nChurches believe in Monophysitism pops up again. We had a discussion\nabout it a while ago. \n\n\nThen OFM comments :\n\n\nWith my appreciation to the moderator, I believe that further elaboration\nis needed. This is an excerpt from an article featured in the first issue\nof the Copt-Net Newsletter :\n\nUnder the authority of the Eastern Roman Empire of Constantinople (as opposed\nto the western empire of Rome), the Patriarchs and Popes of Alexandria played\nleading roles in  Christian theology.  They were  invited everywhere to speak\nabout the Christian faith. St. Cyril, Pope of Alexandria, was the head of the\nEcumenical Council which was held in Ephesus in the year 430 A.D. It was said\nthat the bishops of the Church of Alexandria did nothing but spend  all their\ntime in meetings. This leading role, however, did not fare well when politics\nstarted to intermingle with  Church affairs.  It all started when the Emperor\nMarcianus interfered with matters of faith in the Church. The response of St.\nDioscorus, the Pope of Alexandria who was later  exiled, to this interference\nwas clear: "You have nothing to do with the Church."  These political motives\nbecame even more  apparent in Chalcedon  in 451, when the Coptic  Church  was\nunfairly  accused of following  the  teachings of  Eutyches, who believed  in\nmonophysitism. This  doctrine maintains that the  Lord Jesus Christ  has only\none nature, the divine, not two natures, the human as well as the divine.\n\nThe Coptic  Church   has never  believed  in  monophysitism  the way   it was\nportrayed in the Council of Chalcedon!  In  that Council, monophysitism meant\nbelieving in one  nature.  Copts   believe that the Lord   is perfect in  His\ndivinity,  and He   is perfect in  His humanity,  but  His  divinity  and His\nhumanity were united in one nature called "the nature of the incarnate word",\nwhich was reiterated by St. Cyril of Alexandria.  Copts, thus, believe in two\nnatures "human" and   "divine"  that are   united in   one "without mingling,\nwithout confusion, and without alteration" (from the  declaration of faith at\nthe end of the Coptic divine liturgy).  These  two  natures "did not separate\nfor a moment or the twinkling of an eye" (also from  the declaration of faith\nat the end of the Coptic divine liturgy).\n\nThe  Coptic Church was  misunderstood in the 5th century  at the  Council  of\nChalcedon.  Perhaps the Council  understood   the Church correctly, but  they\nwanted to exile the  Church,   to  isolate it  and to  abolish the  Egyptian,\nindependent Pope. Despite  all of this,  the Coptic Church  has remained very\nstrict  and steadfast in its faith.   Whether it was   a  conspiracy from the\nWestern Churches to exile the Coptic Church  as a  punishment for its refusal\nto be politically influenced, or whether Pope Dioscurus  didn't  quite go the\nextra  mile to  make the  point that  Copts  are not  monophysite, the Coptic\nChurch has always felt a mandate  to reconcile "semantic" differences between\nall  Christian  Churches.   This is   aptly  expressed by the  current  117th\nsuccessor  of  St. Mark, Pope Shenouda III:  "To the  Coptic Church, faith is\nmore  important  than  anything, and   others  must know that  semantics  and\nterminology are of  little importance to us."  Throughout this  century,  the\nCoptic Church has played  an important role  in the ecumenical  movement. The\nCoptic Church is one of the founders of the World Council of Churches. It has\nremained a member of that  council  since 1948 A.D.   The Coptic Church is  a\nmember  of the all  African Council of Churches  (AACC)  and the  Middle East\nCouncil of  Churches (MECC).  The Church    plays an  important role   in the\nChristian   movement   by   conducting dialogues   aiming  at  resolving  the\ntheological differences with the  Catholic, Greek Orthodox, Presbyterian, and\nEvangelical Churches.\n\n[...]\n\nAs a final note, the Oriental Orthodox and Eastren Orthodox did sign\na common statement of Christology, in which the heresey of Monophysitism\nwas condemned. So the Coptic Orthodox Church does not believe in\nMonophysitism.\n\nPeace,\n\nNabil\n\n          .-------------------------------------------------------------.\n         /  Nabil Ayoub                        ____/   __  /    ____/  /\n        /  Engine Research Center             /       /   /    /      /\n       /  Dept. of Mechanical Engineering    ___/    __  /    /      /\n      /  University of Wisconsin-Madison    /       /   |    /      /\n     /  Email:ayoub@erctitan.me.wisc.edu  _____/ __/   _|  _____/  /\n    '-------------------------------------------------------------'\n\n[As I mentioned in a brief apology, the comment quoted above from me\nis confused.  I appear to say that Nestorius was monophysite.  As\nAndrew Byler correctly stated it, the Nestorians and monophysites were\nactually opposite parties.  The point I was making, which Nabil\nexplains in some detail, is that some groups that have been considered\nheretical probably aren't.\n\nChalcedon was a compromise between two groups, the Alexandrians and\nAntiochenes.  It adopted language that was intended to be acceptable\nto moderates in both camps, while ruling out the extremes.  I agree\nthat there were extremes that were heretical.  However in the course\nof the complex politics of the time, it appears that some people got\nrejected who didn't intend heresy, but simply used language that was\nnot understood or even was mispresented.  And some seem not to have\njointed in the compromise for reasons other than doctrine.  There are\ngroups descended from both of the supposedly heretical camps.  This\nposting discussed the descendants of the Alexandrians.  There are also\na remaining Nestorians.  Like some of the current so-called\nmonophysites, there is reason to believe that the current so-called\nNestorians are not heretical either.  They sheltered Nestorius from\nwhat they saw as unfair treatment, but claim they did not adopt his\nheresies, and in fact seem to follow more moderate representatives of\nthe Antiochene tradition.
Jeff Fenholt claims to have once been a roadie for Black Sabbath.\nHe was never ever a musician in the band.  He was in St. Louis several\nmonths back.  The poster I saw at the Christian bookstore I frequent\nreally turned me off.  It was addressed to all "Homosexuals, prostitutes,\ndrug addicts, alcoholics, and headbangers..." or something like that.\n\nWell, if I showed up with my long hair and black leather jacket I\nwould have felt a little pre-judged.  As a Orthodox Christian, and\na "headbanger" I was slightly insulted at being lumped together with\ndrug addicts and alcoholics.  Oh yes, I suppose since I drink a good\nGerman beer now and then that makes me an alcoholic.  NOT!
I apologize if this article is slightly confusing, and late. The origonal\ndraft didn't make it through the moderators quote-screens. So I did\nviolence to it, but if you remember the article I am responding\nto it should still make sence.\n\n\nWhat, no hello for heathan netters?\n\nI feel all left out now. :(\n\n[deletia- table of content, intro, homosexuality]\n\n\n[deletia- incorrect attributions]\n\nUh, you have your attributions wrong, you were responding\nto my article, so Dan Johnson should be the 1st one.\n\n\n[deletia- no free gifts speil nuked by moderator fiat.]\n\n\nAh, in the _cosmic_ sence.. but who lives in the cosmic sence?\nNot me! Cosmicly, we don't even exist for all practical purposes.\nI can hardly use the Cosmic Sence Of Stuff as a guide to life.\nIt would just say: "don't bother."\n\nLuckily for mortals, there are many sences of scale you can talk\nabout. In a human sence, you can have big purposes.\n\n\nBut the influence of Aristotle, Confucious, Alexander, Ceasar and\ncountless others is still with us, although their works have perished.\n\nBut they have changed to course of history, and while humanity exists,\ntheir deeds cannot be said to have come to nothing, even if they\nare utterly forgotten.\n\n\nOne day, surely. (well, unless you believe in the Second Coming, which\nI do not)\n\nBut in that time we can make a difference.\n\n\nIn the end. But it must be the end; until then, there is all the\npoint you can muster. And when that end comes, there will be nobody\nto ask, "Gee, I don't think James Sledd's deeds are gonna make\nmuch of a difference, ulitmately, ya know?".\n\nBut they will have already have made a difference, great or small,\nbefore the end.\n\nWhy must your ends be eternal to be worthwhile?\n\n\nLittle is in the eye of the beholder, of course.\n\n\nI don't doubt it. But I have thought about the cosmic scale. And\nit does not seem to mean much to us, here, today.\n\n\nI would not find this comforting. But perhaps it is merely my\ndefinitions. Here's what I think the relevant terms are:\n\n"Reality"	That which is real.\n"Illusion"	That which is not real, but seems to be.\n"Real"		Objectively Existing\n\nFor "reality" to be an "illusion" would mean, then:\n\nThat which is real is not real, but seems to be.\n\nOr:\n\nThat which objectively exists, does not objectively exist, but\ndoes seem to objectively exist.\n\nFrom which we can conclude, that unless you want to get a\ncontradiction, that no things objectively exist.\n\nBut I have a problem with this because I would like to say\nthat *I* objectively exist, if nothing else. Cogito Ergo Sum\nand all that.\n\nPerhaps you do not mean all that, but rather mean:\n"Objective Reality is Unreachable by humans."\n\nWhich is not so bad, and so far as I know is true.\n\n\nHave on. If reality is an illusion, isn't True Reality an illusion\ntoo? And if True Reality is spirit, doens't that make Spirit an Illusion\nas well?\n\nIf I am not distinctly confused, this is getting positively Buddhist.\n\n\nThat is one hell of a statement, although perhaps true.\n\nDo you mean to imply that it was *intended* to be so? If so,\nplease show that this is true. If not, please explain how this\ncan give a purpose to anything.\n\n\nHow does it do that?\n\nWouldn't the world=school w/ intent idea make the world a preparation for\nsome *greater* purpose, rather than a purpose in itself.\n\n\nWhat pressure?\n\n\nIt is not necessary to be a success in human terms, unless your\ngoals either include doing so or require doing so before they\nthemselves can be achived.\n\nIndeed, many people have set goals for themselves that\ndo not include success in human terms as _I_ understand it. Check\nout yer Buddhist monk type guy. Out for nirvana, which is not\nat all the same thing.\n\n\nWhy is learning to love a goal? What happens if you fail in this\ngoal? To you? To God? To the mysterious Purpose?\n\n\n[deletia- question about immortailty and my answer deleted because it was\n mostly quote.]\n\n\nI'll have a crack at that.\n\n(1) The nature of eternal life is neatly described by its name: It is\nthe concept of life without death, life without end.\n\n(2) No. We can put together word to describe it, but we cannot imagine it.\n\n(2a) No metaphor is adequate next to eternity; if it were we could not\nunderstand it either.

...\n\nBut what was wrong with it?  It won't tempt anyone to any kind of sin, as\nfar as I can tell.  It doesn't belittle anyone.  It does not substitute\noffensiveness for humor (it's genuinely funny).\n\nWe shouldn't assume that _all_ jokes that mention sexuality are "dirty"\nmerely because so many are.\n\nAnd we should never mistake prudery for spirituality.  It can be the direct\nopposite -- a symptom of the _lack_ of a healthy perspective on God's\ncreation.
Two follow up's to Mark's last posting:\n\n	1.  As far as current investigations, the Church recently declared the\n	    crying statue and corresponding messages from Mary at Akita,\n	    Japan as approved (I found this out about a month ago.)\n\n	2.  Again in the proof department, start with the appearances of Mary\n	    at Fatima.  Among other things, there were pictures taken of the\n	    "miracle of the sun" that appeared in some major American newspaper\n	    (The New York Times, I believe) as well as most of the major\n	    European newspapers.  \n\n	    I could talk (or post) for hours on this topic, but... \n		(I have a thesis to write).\n						God Bless,\n							- Mike Walker
[There may be some misunderstanding over terms here...]\n\nI agree.  Quite likely, actually.\n\n                                                      [...I believe "Jesus\n   only" originally was in the context of baptism.  These are folks who\n   believe that baptism should be done with a formula mentioning only\n   Jesus, rather than Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.  This may have\n   doctrinal implications, but as far as I know it does not mean that\n   these folks deny the existence or divinity of the Father.  I'm not the\n   right one to describe this theology, and in fact I think there may be\n   several, including what would classically be called monophysite or\n   Arian (two rather different views), as well as some who have beliefs\n   that are probably consistent with Trinitarian standards, but who won't\n   use Trinitarian language because they misunderstand it or simply\n   because it is not Biblical.  --clh]\n\nNot Biblical?  What then can they make of the end of Matthew?\n\n(28:18)And Jesus came and said to them, "All authority in heaven and on\nearth has been given to me. (19)Go therefore and make disciples of all\nnations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and\nof the Holy Spirit, (20) and teaching them to obey everything that I\nhave commanded to you.  And remember, I am with you always, to the end\nof the age." {Other ancient authorities add *Amen*} [NRSV]\n\nThe notes give no sense that this is emended.  Do other texts\ncontradict this regarding Baptism?  Or is a misunderstanding of the\nTrinity the most likely explanation after all?\n\nBut maybe I simply misunderstand their views.  (Is anyone else out there\nforced to read this group with both a good Bible and an unabridged\ndictionary??  Christianity really is an education in itself.)\n\n--\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[Arrgggghhhh.  When I talked about people who rejected Trinitarian\nlanguage as unBiblical, I was speaking of Trinitarian theology, things\nlike "one essense and three persons".  Obviously the three-fold\nbaptismal formula is Biblical, as you point out.  (I normally use the\nterm "three-fold" in referring to Mat.  While it is certainly\nconsistent with belief in the Trinity, the Trinity is a doctrine whose\nfull formulation occurred in the 4th and 5th Cent's.  It's unlikely\nthat Mat. had in mind the fully-developed Trinitarian doctrine.\nIndeed the three-fold baptismal formula is used by some groups that do\nnot believe in the Trinity.)  The disagreement over baptismal formulae\noccurs because of passages such as Acts 2:38, which command baptism in\nthe name of Jesus.  (There are a couple of other passages in Acts as\nwell.)  This leaves us with sort of a problem: we're commanded in Mat.\nto baptize in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit,\nand in Acts to baptize in the name of Jesus.\n\n"Jesus only" groups baptize in the name of Jesus.  They consider this\nconsistent with Mat 28:18, because they say that Jesus is the name of\nthe Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.  I'm not the right one to\nask to explain what this means.  I will simply say that it does not\nappear to be normal Trinitarian theology.  (It is also an odd way of\ndealing with the idiomatic phrase "in the name of".)\n\nThose who use the three-fold formula don't seem to have a standard\nanswer to the passages talking about baptizing in the name of Jesus.\nI suspect that the most common explanation is to say that "in the name\nof" need not be a verbal formula.  To say that you baptize in the name\nof Jesus may simply mean that you are doing baptism under Jesus'\nauthority.  In the 1st Cent. context, it contrasts Christian baptism\nwith the baptism of John or other Jewish baptism.  Of course there's a\ncertain parallelism between these passages.  That suggests that we\ncould just as well say that Mat 28:18 doesn't require the specific\nthree-fold formula to be used in baptism, but simply characterizes\nbaptism done by those who follow the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.\n\nOne might well suspect that in the early church, more than one\nbaptismal formula was used.  So long as we consider following Jesus to\nbe the same as following the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, no great\ndamage would be done by such a difference.  This does *not* mean that\nI think we should go back to using both formulae.  Baptism is one of\nthe few things that almost all Christian groups now recognize\nmutually, so I do not think doing something to upset that would be in\nthe interests of the Gospel.  This is reinforced by the fact that\nthose groups that actually use "in the name of Jesus" now do seem to\nhave in mind a difference in doctrine.  But as I've said before, I'm\nnot the one to explain what their doctrine is.
Rob Butera asks about a book called THE LOST YEARS OF JESUS, by\nElizabeth Clare Prophet.\n\nI do not know the book. However, Miss Prophet is the leader of a\ngroup (The Church Universal and Triumphant) derived from the I AM\ngroup founded by a Mr. Ballard who began his mission in the 1930's\n(I am writing this from memory and may not have all the details\nstraight -- for an old account, check your library for a bnook by\nMarcus Bach) after an eighteenth-century Frenchman appeared, tapped\nhim on the shoulder, and offered him a cup of "cosmic essence." A\nmajor tenet of the movement is that there is a monastery in the\nmountains of Tibet from which a monk descends to the lower altitudes\nevery few centuries to preach, and that all major religions have\nbeen founded by monks from this monastery. Typically, the Ballard\nfamily and their successors, the Prophet family (related by\nmarriage, if I remember aright), base almost all their teachings on\nmessages they have allegedly received by telepathy from Tibet. I\nshould be surprised if the book you mention has any scholarly basis.
And the two simplest refutations are these:\n\n(1)  What impact?  The only record of impact comes from the New Testament.\nI have no guarantee that its books are in the least accurate, and that\nthe recorded "impact" actually happened.  I find it interesting that no other\ncontemporary source records an eclipse, an earthquake, a temple curtain\nbeing torn, etc.  The earliest written claim we have of Jesus' resurrection\nis from the Pauline epistles, none of which were written sooner than 20 years\nafter the supposed event.\n\n(2)  It seems probable that no one displayed the body of Jesus because no\none knew where it was.  I personally believe that the most likely\nexplanation was that the body was stolen (by disciples, or by graverobbers).\nDon't bother with the point about the guards ... it only appears in one\ngospel, and seems like exactly the sort of thing early Christians might make\nup in order to counter the grave-robbing charge.  The New Testament does\nrecord that Jews believed the body had been stolen.  If there were really\nguards, they could not have effectively made this claim, as they did.
Well, it wasn't that way for Enoch and Elijah, both of whom were\ntranslated directly into heaven.  It's beyond my grasp why some object\nthat Mary, who was far greater than either Enoch or Elijah, should not\nbenefit from the same privelege they recieved.  She was after all,\nMother of God, full of grace, and immaculate.\n\n\nAnd in St. Germain of Constantinople and St. John of Damascus, and in\nSt. Andrew of Crete, among others.\n\nAnd it should be noted that the Monophysite Chruches of Egypt and Syria\nalso hold to this belief as part of divine revelation, even though they\nbroke away from the unity of the Chruch in 451 AD by rejecting the\nCouncil of Chalcedon.  It might be argued by some Protestants that the\nCatholics and Orthodox made this belief up, but the Monophysites, put a\nbig hole in that notion, as they also hold the belief, and they split\nfrom the Chruch before the belief was first annunciated in writing (as\nfar as is known, much has been lost from the time of the Fathers).
As far as I can see, one of the big differences between Davidians and\nChristians is in who they follow.  I have sometimes tried to put myself\nin the feet of one of Jesus's disciples.  Basically, they gave up a\nlot --- career, possibly family, and well, a whole bunch, to follow\nJesus.\n\nSo what is the difference?  It is quite plain.  Jesus was good and\nDavid Koresh was not.\n\nThe problem is, I think, is that we try to legislate what is good\nand what is bad in terms of principles.  For instance, there are thousands of \nlaws in the U.S. governing what is legal and what is not.  Often, it is hard\nto bring people to justice, because it is not possible to find\na legal way to do it.  If only we could trust judges to be just,\nthen we could tell them to administer justice fairly, and justice\nwould be followed.  But since judges don't always get it right,\nwe have a complicated system involving precedent and bunches\nof other stuff which attempt to make the imperfect (the justice\nof man) into something perfect.  But what I hear about the justice\nsystem in the U.S. tells me that quite the opposite is true.\n\nThere is also a problem that we tend to judge the presentation\nmore than the material being presented.  So we might consider \na ranting Christian to be bad, but an eloquent person from another\nreligion to be good.  This goes along with the American desire\nto protect the Constitution at all costs, even if it allows\npeople to do bad things. \n\nI think that it is the message that is important.  If a man is\npresenting a false message, even if he is ever ever so mild mannered,\nthen that man is performing a tremendous disservice.\n\nI know that I am rambling here.  I guess that what I am trying to\nsay is that we shouldn't be looking for principles that tell us\nwhy the Davidians got it wrong.  It is not wrong to follow and\nworship a person.  But it is important to choose the right person.\nIt is simple.  Choose Jesus, and you got it right.  Choose\nanyone else, and you got it wrong.  Why?  Because Jesus is the\nbegotten son of God, and nobody else is.  Jesus was without sin, and\nnobody else was.

Jesus's enemies *would not* have stolen His\n                body because that would have perpetrated the\n                resurrection--the very opposite of what they\n                desired.\n\n            2.  Jesus' disciples *could not* have stolen His\n                body because Pontius Pilate established guards\n                to stand watch over the tomb lest His body be\n                stolen.\n\n            3.  Sadly (and ironically), many of Jesus' disciples\n                did not believe in the Resurrection until Jesus\n                had risen from the dead.\n\n            4.  In nearly 20 centuries, no body has ever been\n                produced to refute Jesus' assertion that He\n                *would indeed* rise from the dead.
Yep.  There's truth in all those religions, even in science.   \nChristianity doesn't claim to know it all.  It does claim certain  \nthings are true though that contradict other religions' truth claims.   \nSo they can't all be true.
I won't even recommend books from my congregation.  What you ask sounds\nattractive but it is dangerous.  As a new Christian you don't want to be\ncontaminated with other people's interpretation.  Steep your self in\nscripture, and discuss with other christians.  Read if your must but\nremember that what other people write is their interpretation.  God has\npromised to give you light, so ask for it.\n\n\n\nDon't wait too long before attaching yourself to church.  Just remember to\nalways compare what they teach you with scripture like the Bereans did.
Larry L. Overacker writes, responding to Simon:\n\n   I may be interesting to see some brief selections posted to the\n   net.  My understanding is that SSPX does not consider ITSELF in\n   schism or legitimately excommunicated.  But that's really beside\n   the point.  What does the Roman Catholic church say?\n   Excommunication can be real apart from formal excommunication, as\n   provided for in canon law.\n\nHere's some of the theology involved for the interested.\n\nThere is confusion over this issue of the SSPX's "schism"; often the\nbasic problem is lack of an ability to distinguish between:\n\n- true obedience\n- false obedience\n- disobedience\n- schism\n\nTake the various classifications of obedience first.  There are 2\nimportant elements involved here for my purposes:\n\n1) a command\n2) the response made to the command\n\nAs far as the command goes, commands can be LEGITIMATE, such as the\nPope ordering Catholics to not eat meat on Fridays.  Or they can be\nILLEGITIMATE, such as the Pope ordering Catholics to worship the god\nDagon when every other full moon comes around.\n\nAs far as the response to a command goes, it can be to REFUSE to do\nwhat is commanded, or to COMPLY.\n\nMaking a table, there are thus 4 possibilites:\n\ncommand         response            name\n-----------------------------------------------------\nLEGITIMATE      COMPLY              true obedience\nILLEGITIMATE    REFUSE              true obedience\nLEGITIMATE      REFUSE              disobedience\nILLEGITIMATE    COMPLY              false obedience\n\nSo now you see where my 3 classifications of obedience come from.\n\nObedience is not solely a matter of compliance/refusal.  The nature of\nthe commands must also be taken into account; it is not enough to\nconsider someone's compliance or refusal and then say whether they are\n"obedient" or "disobedient".  You also have to take into consideration\nwhether the commands are good or bad.\n\nIn my example, if the Pope commands all Catholics to worship the god\nDagon, and they all refuse, they aren't being disobedient at all!\n\nAs far as the Society of Saint Pius X goes, they are certainly\nrefusing to comply with certain things the Pope desires.  But that\nalone is insufficient to allow one to label them "disobedient".  You\nalso have to consider the nature of the Papal desires.\n\nAnd there's the rub: SSPX says the Popes since Vatican II have been\ncommanding certain very bad things for the Church.  The Popes have of\ncourse disagreed.\n\nSo where are we?  Are we in another Arian heresy, complete with weak\nPopes?  Or are the SSPX priests modern Martin Luthers?  Well, the only\nway to answer that is to examine who is saying what, and what the\ntraditional teaching of the Church is.\n\nThe problem here is that very few Catholics have much of an idea of\nwhat is really going on, and what the issues are.  The religion of\nAmerican Catholics is especially defective in intellectual depth.  You\nwill never read about the issues being discussed in the Catholic press\nin this country.  (On the other hand, one Italian Catholic magazine I\nget -- 30 Days -- has had interviews with the Superior General of the\nSociety of Saint Pius X.)\n\nMany Catholics will decide to side with the Pope.  There is some\nsoundness in this, because the Papacy is infallible, so eventually\nsome Pope *will* straighten all this out.  But, on the other hand,\nthere is also unsoundness in this, in that, in the short term, the\nPopes may indeed be wrong, and such Catholics are doing nothing to\nhelp the situation by obeying them where they're wrong.  In fact, if\nthe situation is grave enough, they sin in obeying him.  At the very\nleast, they're wasting a great opportunity, because they are failing\nto love Christ in a heroic way at the very time that He needs this\nbadly.\n\nSchism... let's move on to schism.  What is it?\n\nSchism is a superset of disobedience (refusal to obey a legitimate\ncommand).  All schismatics are disobedient.  But it's a superset, so\nit doesn't work the other way around: not all disobeyers are\nschismatics.  The mere fact that the SSPX priests don't comply with\nthe Holy Father's desires doesn't make them schismatics.\n\nSo what is it that must be added to disobedience to constitute a\nschism?  Maybe this something else makes the SSPX priests schismatics.\n\nYou must add this: the rejection of the right to command.  Look in any\ndecent reference on Catholic theology, and that's what you'll find:\nthe distinguishing criterion of schism is rejection of the right to\ncommand.\n\nHere's what the Catholic Encyclopedia says, for example:\n\n    ... not every disobedience is a schism; in order to possess this\n    character it must include besides the trangression of the commands\n    of superiors, denial of their Divine right to command.\n    (from the CE article "Schism")\n\nIs the Society of Saint Pius X then schismatic?  The answer is a clear\nno: they say that the Pope is their boss.  They pray for him every\nday.  And that's all that matters as far as schism goes.\n\nWhat all this boils down to is this: if we leave aside the\nconsideration of the exact nature of their objections, their position\nis a legitimate one, as far as the Catholic theology of obedience and\nschism goes.  They are resisting certain Papal policies because they\nthink that they are clearly contrary to the traditional teaching of\nthe Papacy, and the best interests of the Church.  (In fact, someone\nwho finds himself in this situation has a *duty* to resist.)\n\nNow, what is the stance of Rome on all this?  Well, if you read the\nHoly Father's motu proprio "Ecclesia Dei", you can find out.  It's the\ndefinitive document on the subject.  A motu proprio is a specifically\nPapal act.  It's not the product of a Roman congregation, a letter\nthat the Pope has possibly never even read.  It's from the Pope\nhimself.  His boss is God... there's no one else to complain to.\n\nIn this document, the Holy Father says, among other things:\n\n1) The episcopal consecrations performed by Archbishop Lefebvre\nconstituted a schismatic act.\n\n2) Archbishop Lefebvre's problem was a misunderstanding of the nature\nof Tradtion.\n\nBoth are confusing: I fail to see the logic of the Pope's points.\n\nAs far as the episcopal consecrations go, I read an interesting\narticle in a translation of the Italian magazine "Si Si No No".  It\nall gets back to the question of jurisdiction.  If episcopal\nconsecrations imply rejection of the Pope's jurisdiction, then they\nwould truly constitute a schismatic act, justifying excommunication\nunder the current code of canon law.  But my problem with this is\nthis: according to the traditional theology of Holy Orders, episcopal\nconsecration does not confer jurisdiction.  It only confers the power\nof Order: the ability to confect the Sacraments.  Jurisdiction must be\nconferred by someone else with the power to confer it (such as the\nPope).  The Society bishops, knowing the traditional theology quite\nwell, take great pains to avoid any pretence of jurisdiction over\nanyone.  They simply confer those Sacraments that require a bishop.\n\nThe "Si Si No No" article was interesting in that it posited that the\nreason that the Pope said what he did is that he has a novel,\npost-Vatican II idea of Holy Orders.  According to this idea,\nepiscopal consecration *does* confer jurisdiction.  I lent the article\nto a friend, unfortunately, so can't tell you more.  I believe they\nquoted the new code of canon law in support of this idea.\n\nThe Pope's thinking on this point remains a great puzzle to me.\nThere's no way there is a schism, according to traditional Catholic\ntheology.  So why does the Pope think this?\n\nAs far as the points regarding the nature of Tradition goes, here's\nthe passage in question:\n\n    The root of this schismatic act can be discerned in an incomplete\n    and contradictory notion of Tradtion.  Incomplete, because it does\n    not take sufficiently into the account the living character of\n    Tradition, which, as the Second Vatican Council clearly taught,\n\n        comes from the apostles and progresses in the Church with the\n        help of the Holy Spirit.  There is a growth in insight into\n        the realities and words that are being passed on.  This comes\n        about in various ways.  It comes through the contemplation and\n        study of believers who ponder these things in their hearts.\n        It comes from the intimate sense of spiritual realities which\n        they experience.  And it comes from the preaching of those who\n        have received, along with their right of succession in the\n        espiscopate, the sure charism of truth.\n\n    But especially contradictory is a notion of Tradition which\n    opposes the universal Magisterium of the Church possessed by the\n    Bishop of Rome and the body of bishops.  It is impossible to\n    remain faithful to the Tradition while breaking the ecclesial bond\n    with him to whom, in the person of the Apostle Peter, Christ\n    himself entrusted the ministry of unity in His Church.\n\n    (Papal motu proprio "Ecclesia Dei", 2 July 1988)\n\nIt seems to me that the Holy Father is making two points here that can\nbe simplified to the following:\n\n- Vatican Council II has happened.\n- I am the Pope.\n\nThe argument being that either case is sufficient to prove that\nArchbishop Lefebvre must be wrong, because he disagrees with them.\nThis is weak, to say the least!\n\nIt would have helped clarify things more if the Pope had addressed\nArchbishop Lefebvre's concerns in detail.  What is John Paul II's\nstand on the social Kingship of Christ, as taught by Gregory XVI, Pius\nIX, Leo XIII, Pius XI and Pius XII, for example?  Are we supposed to\nignore what all these Popes said on the subject?\n\nI don't know what the future will hold, but the powers that be in the\nSSPX are still talking with Rome and trying to straighten things out.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[Many people would prefer to call a justified refusal to obey\n"justified disobedience" or even "obeying God rather than man".\nCalling a refusal to obey obedience puts us into a sort of Alice in\nWonderland world where words mean whatever we want them to mean.\n\nSimilarly, schism indicates a formal break in the church.  If the Pope\nsays that a schism exists, it seems to me that by definition it\nexists.  It may be that the Pope is on the wrong side of the break,\nthat there is no good reason for the break to exist, and that it will\nshortly be healed.  But how can one deny that it does in fact exist?\n\nIt seems to me that you are in grave danger of destroying the thing\nyou are trying to reform: the power of the papacy.  What good will it\ndo you if you become reconciled to the the Pope in the future, but in\nthe process, you have destroyed his ability to use the tools of church\ndiscipline?  It's one thing to hold that the Pope has misused his\npowers, and excommunicated someone wrongly.  It's something else to\nsay that his excommunication did not take effect, and the schism is\nall in his imagination.  That means that acts of church discipline are\nnot legal tools, but acts whose validity is open to debate.  Generally\nit has been liberal Catholics who have had problems with the Pope.\nWhile they have often objected to church sanctions, generally they\nhave admitted that the sanctions exist.  You are now opening the door\nto people simply ignoring papal decisions, claiming to be truly\nobeying by disobeying, and to be in communion while excommunicated.\nThis would seem to be precisely the denial of Divine right to command\nthat you say defines schism.
[text deleted]\n\nI wish that you had followed this thread before jumping to conclusions.\nI haven't seen anybody write that AIDS was a *punishment* for certain\ntypes of sin (this includes Mark Ashley who you were responding to\nhere).  I myself wrote that when you don't do things God's way that\ncurses will come on you and others.  Although one definition of 'curse'\nis 'retribution', I only meant 'harm or misfortune' when I used the\nword.  Because God loves us he has told us the best way to live in his\nBible.  God doesn't cause curses, he warns us of them.\n\nKevin Davis wrote (a while ago):\n\nThe Bible makes it clear that we all equally deserve death (which is\nmuch worse than AIDS) -- we have all hurt God with our sin.\n\nPaul Conditt reveals his feelings:\n\nThe first issue you bring up is your anger.  It is "obvious"ly wrong to\nbe angry (Gal 5:19-20) for any reason, especially *extremely* angry\nwhich is on par with hatred.  Jesus has every reason to be angry at us\nfor putting him on the cross with our sin, yet his prayer was "forgive\nthem Father, they know not what they do."  Knowing how forgiving Jesus\nhas been with me calls me to be more forgiving with everyone out of\nlove for Him.  Please don't give in to anger, it will only cause\nfoolish quarrels and more bad feelings.\n\nIt's okay if you read something that bothers you, but you need to\naddress it in a loving way.  If right now, I felt like someone out\nthere was saying that God punishes gay or sexually immoral people with\nAIDS because they deserve punishment that others don't then I would\nframe a response something like this:\n\n"It makes me feel very sad for someone to believe that AIDS, which is\nsimply a harmful disease not so unlike any other, is God's punishment\nfor people who have committed certain sins.  God loves all of his\nchildren equally and rejoices when a single one comes back to him.  We\nwill all be judged after we die, but until then we all have the\nopportunity to accept God's grace by earnestly seeking after him with\nall of our hearts, believing the gospel's testimony, repenting of our\nsin, confessing that Jesus is Lord at baptism, and living a new life\nfor him.\n Let us not judge someone to be eternally condemned.  God's arm is not\nto short to save.  He will do anything he can to move a hardened heart\nor a misled person.  He works for the good of all men.  Even through\nthe worst of situations, he has set the times and places for all men\nthat they may perhaps reach out and find him."\n\nThe second issue you bring up is seeing people rationalize their fears\nof people with AIDS.  Fortunately, what you describe as seeing is\nactually misperceiving.  You have been missing the points made in the\nearlier posts and reacting in anger to attitudes that haven't been\nexpressed.  I know that its sometimes hard to discount your\nperceptions, but please try to be open-minded.\n\nYou are quite correct in saying that we should reach out to all people\nbecause they all need Jesus.  This is what my brothers and sisters and\nI do on a daily basis.  If you would like to send me the name of the\ncity and state you live in, I will find and get you in touch with some\nbrothers who have AIDS or know people with AIDS and live nearby you so\nthat you can see the loving attitudes for yourself.\n\nThe third issue you bring up is the importance of how some individual\ncontracted AIDS.  How someone gets AIDS is only relevant to their\nsalvation in that there may be repetence involved.\n\nThe important point to be made, however, is that not listening to God's\ncommands (or advice or warnings), i.e. sinning, causes harm or\nmisfortune to yourself and others.  For this reason, a good way to\nprevent the misfortune of AIDS, which can be transmitted in sinful ways,\nis to listen to God's advice and have sex only with your wife or\nhusband.\n\nI hope that you are feeling better now, Paul.\n\nLove,
I guess there are at least some people who are not able to support\nthis claim. There are still a lot of languages without the Bible, or a\npart of the Bible. There are still many languages which we are not\nable to write, simply because the written version of the language has\nnot yet been defined!\n\nI guess this is one of the main goals for Wycliffe Bible Translators:\nTo define rules and a grammar for writing the 'rest' of the languages\nof this world. I do not see that any of them will have any reason to\nbecome unemployed during the foreseeable future. (Provided they get\ntheir neccessary support!) And still they are one of the 3 largest\nmissionary organizations of the world.\n\nBjorn
i'd just like to repeat and emphasize that because someone else is\ntrying to make you feel horrible and worthless does not mean that you\nshould feel that way, although that's easier to say than believe\nsometimes.  remember, God made you and loves you, so he must think\nyou're something special.

[ ACT 5:40 - 41 ]\n\n...\n...\n\nThe basic problem with your argument is your total and complete reliance on\nthe biblical text.  Luke's account is highly suspect (I would refer you to\nthe hermeneia commentary on Acts).  Moreover Luke's account is written at\nleast 90 years after the fact.  In the meantime everyone he mentions has died\nand attempts to find actual written sources behind the text have come up\nwith only the we section of the later portion of acts as firmly established.\nMoreover, Pauls account of some of the events in Acts (as recorded in \nGalatians) fail to establish the acts accounts. \n\nWhat we need, therefore, is a reliable text, critically appreciated, which\ndocuments the death of Christians for belief in the Resurrection.  I would\nsuggest you look at some greek and roman historians.  I think you will be\ndisapointed.
From time to time I have made reference to a book called "The Two Babylons"\nwhich is a book written by Alexander Hislop (mid 1800's) about the Babylonian\nmystery religion and its flight through history.  I was unable to put it down\nthe first time I read it, but others have found it dry.  It has numberable\nreferences and illustrations.  If you are interested in purchasing your own\ncopy, you can call Moody Book Store @ (312)329-4352 and order it for $16.99 and\nthey will ship it to you.   \n  It is a good book just to get the reference titles for your own digs into the\nmystery religions.  I have found it invaluable for that purpose alone.  But for\nthose who only want to skim the subject, it comes highly recommended.  \n  Just a note to my RC brothers and sisters.  You may find this to be a\ndiatribe or you may find it to be a test to the origin and true nature of the\norigin of RCism.  If you are offended by anything that asks hard questions\nabout your denomination (as to whether or not it is "Christian") then perhaps\nyou should just passover this offer.  To those who are a little more\nadventurous, go for it and later, please contact me with you reasons pro or con\non the scholorship of this book.  I really would be interested.
At the end of a recent (Mon 19 Apr 1993) post, Alastair Thomson\noffers the following "paraphrase" of John 3:16:\n\n   "God loved the world so much, that he gave us His Son,\n   to die in our place, so that we may have eternal life."\n\nThe "to die in our place" bothers me, since it inserts into the\nverse a doctrine not found in the original. Moreover, I suspect that\nthe poster intends to affirm, not merely substitution, but forensic\n(or penal) substitution.  I maintain that the Scriptures in speaking\nof the Atonement teach a doctrine of Substitution, but not one of\nForensic Substitution.\n\nThose interested in pursuing the matter are invited to send for my\nessays on Genesis, either 4 thru 7 (on this question) or 1 through 7\n(with lead-in).

Eric ("Damien"?) was presenting his views on Christianity; I'll\nrespond to a few of his points:\n\n\nThis is certainly a valid objection to religion-as-explanation-of-\nnature.  \n\nFortunately for the convenience of us believers, there is a class of\nquestions that can never be reduced away by natural science.  For\nexample: why does the universe exist at all?  After all, the time-space\nworld didn't have to exist.  Why does *anything* exist? And: is it\npossible for persons (e.g. man) to come into being out of a purely\nimpersonal cosmos?  These questions which look at the real mysteries of\nlife -- the creation of the world and of persons -- provide a permanent\nindicator that the meaning of life in the material world can only be\nfound *outside* that world, in its Source.\n\n\n\nWhen you say that man is *only* an animal, I have to think that you are\npresenting an unprovable statement -- a dogma, if you will.  And one\nthe requires a kind of "faith" too.   By taking such a hard line in\nyour atheism, you may have stumbled into a religion of your own.\n\nBut before you write off all Christianity as phony and shallow, I hope\nyou'll do a little research into its history and varieties, perhaps by\nreading Paul Johnson's "A History of Christianity".  From your remarks,\nit seems that you have been exposed to certain types of Christian\nreligion and not others.  Even an atheist should have enough faith in\nMan to know that a movement of 2000 years has to have some depth, and\nbe animated by some enduring values.\n\nWith best wishes,
I just started reading the group. I was wondering if someone\ncould re-post exactly what the Prophetic Warning to NYC was.\n\nThanks\n-jh

Anything that does not bring me closer to God is a sin. \n(If you think this is too strict, just consider how ambiguous it is.)\n\nThis implies that staying the same is a sin. A Christian should\nnever be satisfied. It does not imply that\nhaving fun is a sin. It does not imply that sleeping is a sin.\nIt does imply that I sin every day.\n\nA perhaps simpler definition:\nAnything that is counter to the two Great Commandments: \nlove God, love your neighbor, is a sin.\nAnything I do that is not from love is a sin.\n\nThe same action can be a sin sometimes and not a sin sometimes.\n\nI could yell at my kids as discipline, all the time loving them,\nconsidering only to teach them proper behavior, or I could yell at my\nkids out of anger or selfishness.\n\nI could post an excellent article because I am interested in sharing\nmy opinions and getting feedback and learning, or I could post an\narticle because I want everyone to realize how wise I am.
*******\n*******  This is somewhat long, but pleas read it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n*******\n\n\n\nBoy am i glad you decided to read this. I've got a problem that \nI need as many people's help from as possible.\n\nBefore I go in to the details of this, let me go ahead and tell\nyou that (though it may sound it) this is not one of those boy\nmeets girl problem...at least not totally like that to me....Anyway...\n\nOK, I am a 19 year old Sophmore at NCSU. About 10 years ago, my family\nand I were vacationing at the coast in a cottage we rented. Across the\nstreet, was ths girl who would whistle at me whenever she saw me...\nher name in Erin. Well, we became friends that week at the beach and have\nbeen writing each other for about 10 years....there was a period of about\n2 years we lost contact..but that was a while ago. \n\nBy the way...Erin lives in Kansas and me in NC.\n\nOK, last year in one of her letters, she says that she is coming\nback to NC to see some of her family who are gonna be there. So I\ndrove about 4 hours to see her. This is where it begins....I spent\nthe whole day with Erin....one of the best days of my life. Even though\nwe had been writing each other, we still had to get used to being\nin person....she has got to be the most incredible woman I ever met.\n(She's one year older than me BTW). I mean, no person in the world could\nask for a better person. Not only was she incredibly beautiful (not to \nmention WAY out of my league...although I'm  not unattractive mind you), but\nshe had a great personality and a great sence of humor. Her family\nis one of those families who goes to church but that is about the\nextent of their Christianity...you know the kind of people. But she\nknows I am a Christian. \n\nWell, you get the idea of what I think of her. If there is ever such\na thing as love at first sight....I found it. That was last year...I kid\nyou not when I say that I have thought about her EVERY day since then.\n\nIn out letters, Erin and I always kid each other about not finding\ndates..(which is true for me, but I know it can't be for her).\nShe has had some problems at home, her folks split up and she ended\nup leaving school....Now we are at the present...\n\nLet me give you part of the letter I got from her last week....\n\n\n"Okay, now I'm going to try to explain my life to you. I'm not\ngoing to KU anymore because something just isn't right. College\njust wasn't clicking with me here. Greek life is really big here and\nthat just isn't my way. I wasn't taking any classes that truly interested\nme & i really have no idea of what i want to do with my life. I was\ninterested in something medical (Physical Therpy) & I love working with \nkids, but 'it' just didn't work for me at this university. And my parents\ncould tell.\n\n"So I'm working full time at the Bass Store [Bass shoes that is] and now\nI have a part-time job at a local daycare. I work in the infant room\nM-W-F. I've really enjoyed it so far. It spices up my week a little bit and \nit's great experience.\n\n"As of now, I'm not planning on going back to school in the very\nnear future. The main reason being my indecision on what I want to\nstudy. But I definatley plan on going back within the next couple of\nyears. Where? I have no idea--except for one thing, it won't be\nto Kansas.\n\n"Right noew I'm discussing a promotion with my boss and district \nmanager. It looks like I'll train at the store I work at now for\nabout 4-6 months as Assistant Manager and when that's done, I'll \nbasically be given a list of stores (newly or soon to be built) to \nchose where i would like to manage. I've pretty much decided on either\none of the Carolinas (hopeully close to the beach) Wouldn't it\nbe fun to actually see each other more than once every few years??\nWhat do you think abou that? I would like to know your opinion.\n\n"This job would pretty much be temporary. But it is VERY GOOD pay\nand any thye of management experience would look good on an application\nor resume. The company is solid and treats it employees very well. Good\nbenefits, bonuses & medical plans. Plus- after 1 year of full-time\nservice, they will reimburse tuition. I do have school money waitng\nfor me, but this will help, especially since I will probably end up \npaying out of state tuition wherever I go.\n\n"Chris, i really would like to know what you think of my decision. I \nrespect your opinion. I've been completely lost for what to do for \nsoooo long that when the opportunity came along it sounded really \ngood. I do like my job although I'm about 99.9% sure that i want\nto do more with my life than reatil management..but it IS something.\nI don't think earning about $20,000 a year for a 20 year old female\nis too bad. \n\n"Anyway, onto your career decisions. I'll solve your problem right now,\nMARRY ME...\n\n"You can do your pilot thing-- I like to be by myself sometimes! Seriously\n(or not as seriously)- do what will make you the happiest, worry about the\nhome life later."\n\n***********\n\nOK, well I'm sure you see what has got me so uptight. What do you\nthink she meant about the marraige thing?? \n\nI dream at night about marrying her, and then she mentions it in her\nletter!!! I don't know what to think??\n\nSince she wants to move to the Carolina's should i search out a \nBass store near here and aske her to come to Carolina???\n\nI always pick on those people who graduate from high school and\nget married....but what does she mean??? \n\nI've had a lot of stress lately with exams and also the fact that \nI don't date beacause 1) No time  2) Not that much $$ 3) that\nmost college women are wrapped up in the social scene with  the\nGreeks whic as a Christian I can't support-----and here\nshe says she doesn't like the Greek thing either!!\n\nMaybe I'm so stunned because there is actually a girl that I am\nso attracted to paying some real attention to me.\n\nI mean, what if she did move to NC...what would I do??? I'm\nonly 19 and she 20....I'm only a Sophmore struggling through\nclasses..\n\nI have prayed about this over the past year from time to time..\nsaying, "God if she is the right one, let the situation open up.."\n\nCould this be my sign???\n\nI would do ANYTHING to get her to NC...here is some moree that makes \nit worse..\n\nShould I call her?? I'm terrible over the phone. I don't even like\nto talk to my friends here for longer than 3 minutes.\n\nI mean, what would a girl as perfect as her want with a very\naverage guy like me??\n\nI'm really confused....I would really appreciate any help i can get.\n\nThanx \n\nChris
On the one hand there are advantages to having the liturgy stay the \nsame.  John has described some of these.  On the other hand, some people \nseem to start tuning out `the same old words' and pay attention better \nwhen things get changed around.  I think innovative priests and liturgy \ncommittees are trying to get our attention and make things more \nmeaningful for us.  It drives me crazy too. \n\nDifferent people have differing preferences and needs in liturgy.  My \nlocal parish is innovative.  I prefer to go to Mass at the next parish \nover.  Sometimes we don't have the option of attending a Mass in the \nstyle which best suits us.  John put a smiley on it but to "just offer \nit up" probably is the solution.\n\nA related issue, that it sounds like John does not have to deal with, is \nthat spouses may have different liturgical tastes.  My husband does like \ninnovative litury.  It is a challenge to meet both of our spiritual \nneeds without just going our separate ways.  When you include the factor \nof also trying to satisfy our children's needs, things get pretty \ncomplicated.\n\nOne thing to remember is that even the most uncongenial Mass is still \nMass.
Reply-To: pwhite@empros.com\n \n \nHere in America people tend to think of choosing a church much like they\nthink of choosing a car or a country club. What I mean is that our \nculture is such that we tend towards satisfying our own wants rather\nthan considering things with others in mind and not making prayer \nan initial and primary part of the decision process. People tend to\ntreat church as they would a club and when something is less than to\ntheir liking, off they go to another one.\n\nI think that scripture presents the idea that God takes a different \nperspective on the "church choosing process". It seems to me from 1Cor 12\nthat God doesn't subscribe to the idea of us choosing a church at all\nbut that he places us in the body as he wants us. So, I think a better\nquestion is not how do I choose a church but how do I figure out where\nGod is trying to place me.\n\nIf a person was instrumental in leading you to Christ, the church they\ngo to is a logical first choice. You have been born into the family of\nGod. People should hop around from church to church as often as they\nhop from natural family to family.\n\nIf you met the Lord on your own (so to speak) there may not be an \neasily identifiable church to try for starters. Here you are more\nlike an orphan. Prayerfully go and "leave yourself on a few doorsteps"\nand see if anyplace feels like home. \n\nI wouldn't expect that God want to place you in a church where you\nhave difficulty fitting in with the people, but on the other hand\nthere are no perfect churches. If you have an attitude of looking\nfor problems you will both find them and make them. On the other hand\nif you have an attitude of love and committment, you will spread that\nwherever you go. \n\nIn general, I think that God will try to place you in a church that\ntalks about the Lord in the way that you have come to know him and is\nexpanding on that base.
The reason for the existence of hell is justice.  Fear is only an effect\nof the reality of hell.\n\n-- \nboundary, the catechist
To what follows, our moderator has already answered the charge of \narrogance more ably that I could have done so, so I will confine\nmyself to answering the charge of illogic.\n \n\n\nThis is how everyone in the western intellectual tradition is, or was,\ntaught to think. It is the fundamental premis "A is not not-A". If a thing\nis true then its converse is necessarilly false. Without this basic \nasumption theology and science as we know them are alike impossible. We\nshould distinguish the strong and weak meanings of the word "believe",\nhowever. The weak sense means I am not sure. "I believe Tom went to \nthe library." (but he could have gone to the track). The strong sense\nmeans I am so certain that I use it as a basis of thought. "I believe \nthat nature operates according to certain fundamental laws." (despite \nthe fact that nature *appears* capricious and unpredictable). Christian\nbelief is of the strong kind. (Though Christians may well hold beliefs\nof the weak kind on any number of theological and ecclesiological \ntopics.)\n \n\nNote that these are two separate ideas. Most hold the first view, but the \nmajority do not hold the second. Is is again a matter of pure logic that\nif Christanity is true, then Hinduism (for example) must necessarilly be\nfalse, insofar as it contradicts or is incompatible with, Christaianity. \n(And, as a matter of *logic*, vice versa.)\n \n\nIt is arrogant to claim to know what *anyone* thinks or wants, unless \nthey have told you. Christians believe God has told us what he thinks\nand wants.\n\n\nMost Christians do not base their belief on the Bible, but on the living\ntradition of the Church established by Christ and guided constantly\nby the Holy Spirit. The Bible is simply the written core of that tradition.\n\n\nIf depends what you mean by differing. If I believe Tom is six feet\ntall and you believe he weighs 200 pounds, our beliefs differ, but we \nmay both be right. If I believe Tom is six feet tall and you beleive\nthat he is four foot nine, one of us, at least, must be wrong.\n \n\nThus you believe that there is a single truth but that no human being \ncan find it. You assert that anyone who believe that we can find \nabsolute truth is mistaken. In short, you believe that anyone who\ndoes not share your belief on this point is wrong. QED.\n\n\nHere I begin to suspect that your real difficulty is not with the\nknowability of truth, but simply with language. Saying that the glass \nis half empty is not a contradiction of the statement that it is half\nfull: it is the same fact expressed in different words. (The whole\npoint of this phrase is to illustrate the different ways the pessimist\nand the optimist express the *same* fact.)\n \nIt is, of course, quite true that different people may express the \nsame belief in different words. It is also true that they may fail\nto understand each other's words as expressions of the same belief\nand may argue bitterly and believe that they are miles apart. Great\nscisms have occurred in just this way, and much ecumenical work has\nbeen done simply in resolving differences in language which conceal\nagreement in belief. This does not mean, in any sense, that all beliefs\nare equally valid. Since some of the beliefs people hold contradict\nsome other beliefs that other people hold, after all obfuscations\nof language and culture in the expression of those beliefs have\nbeen stripped away, some of the beliefs that some people hold must,\n**necessarilly** be false, and it is neither arrogant nor illogical\nto say so. If I believe X and you believe Y we may both be correct, \nbut if Y is equivalent to not-X then one of us is wrong and as long\nas we hold our respective beliefs, we must each regard the other \nas in error.
Several recent posts have identified the English word 'Easter' with\nthe Babylonian goddess 'Ishtar'.\n\n'Easter' is a pagan word all right, but it has nothing to do with Ishtar.\nIf 'Easter' and 'Ishtar' were related, their history would show it.\nBut in Old English, Easter was 'Eostre', cognate with English 'East'\nand German 'Ost'.   The reconstructed Proto-Germanic form is 'Austron'.\nNot until after 1400 did 'Easter' have a high front vowel like 'Ishtar'.\nClearly, the two words have quite separate origins.\n\nThere may be neo-pagans who worship Ishtar at Easter, but if so, they\nare making either a mistake of etymology, or a deliberate play on words.\n\n-- Michael Covington  (Ph.D., linguistics)
jubilee, Pope >Leo the 12th had a medallion cast with his own image on\none side and on >the other side, the Church of Rome symbolized as a\n"Woman, holding in >her left hand a cross, and in her right a cup with\nlegend around her, >'Sedet super universum',  'The whole world is her\nseat."\n\n	You read more into the medal than it is worth.  The Woman is the\nChurch.  Catholics have always called our Church "Holy Mother Church"\nand our "Mother."  An example would be from St. Cyprian of Carthage, who\nwrote in 251 AD, "Can anyone have God for his Father, who does not have\nthe Church for his mother?"\n	Hence the image of the Church as a woman, holding a Cross and a Cup,\nwhich tell of the Crucifxition of Our Lord, and of the power of His\nBlood (the grail legend, but also, more significantly, it shows that\n"This is the Cup of the New Covenant in my blood, which shall be shed\nfor you and for many." (Luke 22.20), the Cup represents the New Covenant\nand holds the blood of redemption).  The fact that the woman is holding\nboth and is said to have the whole world for her seat, is that the\nCatholic Church is catholic, that is universal, and is found throughout\nthe world, and the Church shows the Crucifixtion and applies the blood\nof redemption to all mankind by this spread of hers, thorugh which the\nHoly Sacrafice of the Mass, can be said and celebrated in all the\nnations as Malachi predicted in Malachi 1.11, "From the rising of the\nsun to its setting, my name is great among the gentiles, and everywhere\nthere is sacrafice, and there is offered to my Name a clean oblation,\nfor my Name is great among the gentiles, says the Lord of hosts."  And\nso we acknowledge what St. Paul wrote "For as often as you eat this\nbread and drink this cup, you show the Lord's death until he comes." (1\nCorinthians 11.26)\n\n	You are quite right about the identification of "Babylon the Great,\nMother of all Harlots" with Rome.  I think we simply disagree as to what\ntime period of Rome the Apostle John is talking about.

Are any readers of s.r.c. going to the Love Europe congress in Germany this\nJuly?
While I agree with most of Jon says (I deleted those parts, of course), I \nhave serious reservations about this advice.  Maintaining a `just \nfriends' level of relationship is much easier said than done.  People \nusually end up getting hurt.  This is especially likely to happen when \nthey start off with feelings of attraction.  \n\nWhen people feel attracted those feelings can cloud their judgement.  \nI've had the experience of going quickly from believing that I shouldn't \ndate non-Christians to believing that dating this man would be okay to \nbelieving that premarital sex is fine when people really love each \nother.  When the relationship ended my beliefs immediately returned to \ntheir original state.  \n\nThis is an especially extreme case because I was young and away from home \nand fellowship.  I don't think it would work exactly this way for most \npeople.  However, it's important not to underestimate the power of \nfeelings of attraction.
The problem you see here is that some Christians claim things about\nthe Bible which they don't actually believe or practice. I've known\nall sorts of Christians, ranging from the trendiest of liberals to\nthe fire-breathing fundamentalists, and although many on the \nconservative side of the Christian faith do claim that the Bible is\na (perhaps *the*) source of absolute truth, I don't know of anyone\nwho treats it as anything other than a valuable part of a living tradition.\nWhile I am not a Roman Catholic, I believe this is close to the official\nposition of the RC church (perhaps an RC would like to comment).\n\nThe particular practice you refer to will usually be explained in\nterms of the social context of the time. You would think the fact \nthat the conservatives seem to have to break out the tophat-and-cane \nand give you some big song-and-dance routine about why this \n(other passages as well) aren't directly applicable today would \nshow them that what they claim about the Bible and what they \nactually practice are two different things, but mostly it doens't.\n\nWhile this thread is supposed to be about the arrogance of Christians,\nI would suggest that some of the problem is really hypocrasy, in this\ncase, making claims about the Bible which the claimants don't actually\nput into practice. But if we step back from the name-calling and\nlook at what people are attempting to say, we see that they are trying\nto express very concisely the unique place the Bible holds within the\nChristian faith. So when people use such words or phrases as "Word of\nGod", "inerrant", "infallibale", "The Manufacturer's Handbook", "The\nonly rule of faith and practice in the church today" to describe the\nBible, we should try to hear what they are saying and not just look at\nthe mere words they use. Some of the above descriptions are demostratably\nfalse and others are self-contradictory, but in my experience people are\ngenerally pretty good at picking out the intention of the speaker even\nwhen the speaker's words are at variance with their intentions. A Biblical\nexample is from the garden of Eden where God asks "Where are you?" and Adam\nexplains that he was naked and afraid and hid himself. If Adam had\nanswered God's words he would have said something like "I'm here in this\ntree." The problem seems to arise when Christians insist that these\nwords are indeed accurate reflections of their beleif. Most people\nhave not made a determined effort to work out their own understanding of\nthe place of the Bible within their own faith and so rely on the phrases\nand explanations that others use.\n\nI hope this helps.\n--\n                                                                     ___\nBill Rea                                                            (o o)\n-------------------------------------------------------------------w--U--w---

Is life a pass/fail course, and does God grade on a\ncurve?\n	I'm new here, and only vaguely religious, but I want to\nknow what some of you people think.  Specifically, are there an\ninfinite number of Heavens, and a person goes to the one that\nhe/she deserves?  Or is it simply Heaven or nothing (Hell?)\nAlso, are we "graded" by those around us, or has there always\nbeen some unchanging method?  Is the person's childhood taken\ninto account?\n	I'm sure these must sound like over-simplifications to\nmost of you, but I figure that you're the experts.\n\n						-Quinn\n\n[Eschatology is an area on which Christians do not agree.  I suspect\nthat's because our primary source of information is prophets and\nvisionaries, and their writings tend to be highly symbolic.  However\nboth Jesus' teachings in the Gospels and books such as the Revelation\nto John talk primarily about the difference between eternal life and\neternal death.  On a number of occasions Jesus does say things that\nimply some sort of differentiation, e.g. Lk 10:14 and a number of\nsimilar passages where Jesus says things like "even XXX will be better\noff than you in the judgement."  Also, I Cor 3 talks about someone who\ngets into heaven, but by the skin of his teeth, as it were.  But these\npassages are not normally interpreted as suggesting separate heavens,\nso much as differing levels of prestige or punishment in heaven or\nhell (and not all Christians would even go as far as that).  The only\nChristian group I know of that believes in multiple heavens is the\nMormons, and they are very far from mainstream Christianity (far\nenough that many of our readers would not call them Christian).  Their\nideas in this area involve specific Mormon revelations, in addition\nto the Bible and "Holy Tradition" of a more generic Christian sort.\n\nNote that many Christians will cringe at the very thought of\nassociating grading with God.  The whole point of Christ was to free\nus from the results of a test that we couldn't possibly pass.  If you\nlike test analogies, God grades on a very strict and unbending scale,\nbut he also cheats -- he replaces our test papers with an exam that\nwas prepared by the teacher, before actually doing the grading.\nBecause some people end up in heaven and others in hell, it's easy to\nsee why you'd be inclined to think of it as grading.  While there are\ndifferences among branches of Christianity on details, I think we all\nagree that in one way or another, God cheats.\n\nI am personally very sceptical about anyone who claims to know exactly\nhow far God's cheating extends.  Will he accept people who don't\nexplicitly acknowledge Christ, but somehow still follow him in their\nhearts?  Many Christians believe that this is possible, at least in\nprinciple, but certainly not all do.  Jesus provided us with a clear\ndescription of how to be saved, but it's not clear to me that he\nprovided an exact description of how he's going to place the dividing\nline.  Certainly he made it clear that we can't expect to know whether\nother individuals are saved or not.
Whoah  whoah  whoah  WHOAH!!!   What?!?\n\n	That last paragraph just about killed me.  The Deuterocanonicals have\n	ALWAYS been accepted as inspired scripture by the Catholic Church,\n	which has existed much longer than any Protestant Church out there.\n	It was Martin Luther who began hacking up the bible and deciding to\n	REMOVE certain books--not the fact that the Catholic Church decided\n	to add some much later--that is the reason for the difference between\n	"Catholic" and "Protestant" bibles.
Was it Pascal, or maybe Descartes, who first used this figure of speech? \nI seem to have some vague recollections from reading some of their essays,\nbut I certainly couldn't say it was one of them for sure.

I have come across what I consider to be an excellent tract. It is a\nbit lengthy for a posting, but I thought I'd share it with all of you\nanyway. Feel free to pass it along to anyone whom you feel might\nbenefit from what it says. May God richly bless those who read it.\n \n=======================================================================\n \n                   D O E S  G O D  L O V E  Y O U ?\n \n \nQ. What  kind  of  question  is that?   Anyone who can read sees signs,\n   tracts, books, and bumper stickers that say, "God Loves You."  Isn't\n   that true?\n \nA. It  is  true that God offers His love to the whole world, as we read\n   in one of the most quoted verses in the Bible:\n \n      For  God  so  loved  the world, that he gave his only begotten\n      Son, that whosoever believeth in him should  not  perish,  but\n      have everlasting life.                               John 3:16\n \n \n      The way of the wicked is an abomination unto the LORD:  but he\n      loveth him that followeth after righteousness.   Proverbs 15:9\n \n      For  the LORD knoweth the way of the righteous: but the way of\n      the ungodly shall perish.                            Psalm 1:6\n \n \nQ. But  I am not wicked.  I am a decent, moral person.  Surely the good\n   I have done in my life far outweighs whatever bad I have done.   How\n   can these verses apply to me?\n \nA. By  God's  standard  of  righteousness even the most moral person is\n   looked upon by God as a desperate sinner on his way to  Hell.    The\n   Bible teaches that no one is good enough in himself to go to Heaven.\n   On  the  contrary,  we  are all sinners and we are all guilty before\n   God.\n \n      As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:  There\n      is  none  that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after\n      God.                                            Romans 3:10-11\n \n      The  heart  is  deceitful  above  all  things, and desperately\n      wicked: who can know it?                         Jeremiah 17:9\n \n \nQ. If I am such a wicked person in God's sight, what will God do to me?\n \nA. The  Bible  teaches that at the end of the world all the wicked will\n   come under eternal punishment in a place called Hell.\n \n      For  a  fire is kindled in mine anger, and shall burn unto the\n      lowest hell, and shall consume the earth  with  her  increase,\n      and set on fire the foundations of the mountains.  I will heap\n      mischiefs upon them; I will spend mine arrows upon them.  They\n      shall  be  burnt  with hunger, and devoured with burning heat,\n      and  with  bitter  destruction:  I will also send the teeth of\n      beasts upon them, with the poison of serpents of the dust.\n                                                Deuteronomy 32:22-24\n \n \nQ. Oh,  come  on now!   Hell is not real, is it?  Surely things are not\n   that bad.\n \nA. Indeed,  Hell is very real, and things are that bad for the individ-\n   ual who does not know the Lord Jesus Christ as Savior.    The  Bible\n   makes  many  references  to Hell, indicating that it is both eternal\n   and consists of perpetual suffering.\n \n      And  whosoever  was  not found written in the book of life was\n      cast into the lake of fire.                   Revelation 20:15\n \n      So  shall it be at the end of the world: the angels shall come\n      forth, and sever the wicked from among  the  just,  And  shall\n      cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and\n      gnashing of teeth.                            Matthew 13:49-50\n \n      ...    when  the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with\n      his mighty angels, In flaming fire taking  vengeance  on  them\n      that  know  not  God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord\n      Jesus   Christ:    Who  shall  be  punished  with  everlasting\n      destruction  from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory\n      of his power;                            2 Thessalonians 1:7-9\n \n \nQ. That is terrible!  Why would God create a Hell?\n \nA. Hell  is  terrible,  and  it  exists  because  God created man to be\n   accountable to God for his actions.  God's perfect  justice  demands\n   payment for sin.\n \n      For the wages of sin is death;                     Romans 6:23\n \n      For  we  must  all  appear before the judgment seat of Christ;\n      that every one may  receive  the  things  done  in  his  body,\n      according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad.\n                                                  2 Corinthians 5:10\n \n      But I say unto you, That every idle word that men shall speak,\n      they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment.\n                                                       Matthew 12:36\n \n \nQ. Does that mean that at the end of the world everyone will be brought\n   to life again to be judged and then to be sent to Hell?\n \nA. Indeed  it  does;  that  is,  unless  we  can find someone to be our\n   substitute in bearing the punishment of eternal  damnation  for  our\n   sins.    That  someone  is  God  Himself, who came to earth as Jesus\n   Christ to bear the wrath of God for all who believe in Him.\n \n      All  we  like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one\n      to his own way; and the LORD hath laid on him the iniquity  of\n      us all.                                            Isaiah 53:6\n \n      But  he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for\n      our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace  was  upon  him;\n      and with his stripes we are healed.                Isaiah 53:5\n \n      For  I  delivered  unto  you  first  of  all that which I also\n      received, how that Christ died for our sins according  to  the\n      scriptures; And that he was buried, and that he rose again the\n      third day according to the scriptures:    1 Corinthians 15:3-4\n \n      For  he  hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that\n      we might be made the righteousness of God in him.\n                                                  2 Corinthians 5:21\n \n \nQ. Are  you  saying that if I trust in Christ as my substitute, Who was\n   already punished for my sins, then I will not have  to  worry  about\n   Hell anymore?\n \nA. Yes, this is so!  If I have believed in Christ as my Savior, then it\n   is  as  if  I  have already stood before the Judgment Throne of God.\n   Christ as my substitute has already paid for my sins.\n \n      He  that  believeth  on  the Son hath everlasting life: and he\n      that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but  the  wrath\n      of God abideth on him.                               John 3:36\n \n \nQ. But  what  does it mean to believe on Him?  If I agree with all that\n   the Bible says about Christ as Savior, then am I saved from going to\n   Hell?\n \nA. Believing  on  Christ  means  a  whole lot more than agreeing in our\n   minds with the truths of the Bible.  It means that we hang our whole\n   lives  on Him.   It means that we entrust every part of our lives to\n   the  truths  of the Bible.  It means that we turn away from our sins\n   and serve Christ as our Lord.\n \n      No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one,\n      and  love  the  other;  or  else  he will hold to the one, and\n      despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.\n                                                        Matthew 6:24\n \n      Repent  ye  therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be\n      blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from  the\n      presence of the Lord;                                Acts 3:19\n \n \nQ. Are  you  saying  that  there  is no other way to escape Hell except\n   through Jesus?   What about all the other  religions?    Will  their\n   followers also go to Hell?\n \nA. Yes, indeed.  They cannot escape the fact that God holds us account-\n   able  for  our  sins.   God demands that we pay for our sins.  Other\n   religions  cannot  provide  a  substitute  to bear the sins of their\n   followers.  Christ is the only one who is able to bear our guilt and\n   save us.\n \n      Neither  is  there  salvation  in any other: for there is none\n      other name under heaven given among men, whereby  we  must  be\n      saved.                                               Acts 4:12\n \n \n      I  am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the\n      Father, but by me.                                   John 14:6\n \n      If  we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us\n      our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.\n                                                          1 John 1:9\n \n \nQ. Now I am desperate.  I do not want to go to Hell.  What can I do?\n \nA. You  must  remember  that God is the only one who can help you.  You\n   must throw yourself altogether on the mercies of God.   As  you  see\n   your hopeless condition as a sinner, cry out to God to save you.\n \n      And the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much\n      as  his  eyes  unto heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying,\n      God be merciful to me a sinner.                     Luke 18:13\n \n      ...  Sirs, what must I do to be saved?  And they said, Believe\n      on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, ...\n                                                       Acts 16:30-31\n \n \nQ. But how can I believe on Christ if I know so little about Him?\n \nA. Wonderfully,  God  not  only saves us through the Lord Jesus, but He\n   also gives us the faith to believe on Him.  You can pray to God that\n   He will give you faith in Jesus Christ as your Savior.\n \n      For  by  grace  are  ye  saved  through faith; and that not of\n      yourselves: it is the gift of God:               Ephesians 2:8\n \n   God works particularly through the Bible to give us that faith.  So,\n   if  you  really  mean  business  with  God about your salvation, you\n   should  use  every opportunity to hear and study the Bible, which is\n   the only Word of God.\n   In  this  brochure,  all  verses  from the Bible are within indented\n   paragraphs.  Give heed to them with all your heart.\n \n      So  then  faith  cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of\n      God.                                              Romans 10:17\n \n \nQ. But does this mean that I have to surrender everything to God?\n \nA. Yes.    God wants us to come to Him in total humility, acknowledging\n   our sinfulness and our helplessness, trusting totally in Him.\n \n      The  sacrifices  of  God  are  a broken spirit: a broken and a\n      contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.      Psalm 51:17\n \n   Because  we  are sinners we love our sins.  Therefore, we must begin\n   to pray to God for an intense  hatred  of  our  sins.    And  if  we\n   sincerely desire salvation, we will also begin to turn from our sins\n   as  God  strengthens  us.    We know that our sins are sending us to\n   Hell.\n \n      Unto  you  first God, having raised up his Son Jesus, sent him\n      to bless you, in turning  away  every  one  of  you  from  his\n      iniquities.                                          Acts 3:26\n \n \nQ. Doesn't  the  Bible teach that I must attend church regularly and be\n   baptized?  Will these save me?\n \nA. If  possible,  we should do these things, but they will not save us.\n   No work of any kind can secure our salvation.   Salvation  is  God's\n   sovereign gift of grace given according to His mercy and good pleas-\n   ure.  Salvation is\n \n      Not of works, lest any man should boast.         Ephesians 2:9\n \n \nQ. What else will happen at the end of the world?\n \nA. Those  who have trusted in Jesus as their Savior will be transformed\n   into their glorious eternal bodies and will be with Christ  forever-\n   more.\n \n      For  the  Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout,\n      with the voice of the archangel, and with the  trump  of  God:\n      and  the  dead  in Christ shall rise first:  Then we which are\n      alive  and remain shall be caught up together with them in the\n      clouds,  to meet the Lord in the air:  and so shall we ever be\n      with the Lord.                         1 Thessalonians 4:16-17\n \n \nQ. What will happen to the earth at that time?\n \nA. God  will destroy the entire universe by fire and create new heavens\n   and a new earth where Christ will reign with His believers  forever-\n   more.\n \n      But  the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in\n      the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise,  and\n      the  elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and\n      the   works  that  are  therein  shall  be  burned  up.    ...\n      Nevertheless  we,  according  to  his  promise,  look  for new\n      heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.\n                                                     2 Peter 3:10,13\n \n \nQ. Does  the  Bible  give us any idea of when the end of the earth will\n   come?\n \nA. Yes!    The end will come when Christ has saved all whom He plans to\n   save.\n \n      And  this  gospel  of the kingdom shall be preached in all the\n      world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall  the  end\n      come.                                            Matthew 24:14\n \n \nQ. Can we know how close to the end of the world we might be?\n \nA. Yes!   God gives much information in the Bible concerning the timing\n   of the history of the world and tells us that while the Day  of  the\n   Lord  will come as a thief in the night for the unsaved, it will not\n   come  as  a  thief for the believers.  There is much evidence in the\n   Bible  that  the  end  of  the world and the return of Christ may be\n   very, very close.* All the time clues in the Bible point to this.\n \n      For  when  they  shall  say,  Peace  and  safety;  then sudden\n      destruction cometh upon them, as travail  upon  a  woman  with\n      child; and they shall not escape.          1 Thessalonians 5:3\n \n      Surely  the  Lord  GOD  will  do nothing, but he revealeth his\n      secret unto his servants the prophets.                Amos 3:7\n \n \nQ. But that means Judgment Day is almost here.\n \nA. Yes,  it  does.    God  warned  ancient Nineveh that He was going to\n   destroy that great city and He gave them forty days warning.\n \n      And Jonah began to enter into the city a day's journey, and he\n      cried,  and  said,  Yet  forty  days,  and  Nineveh  shall  be\n      overthrown.                                          Jonah 3:4\n \n \nQ. What did the people of Nineveh do?\n \nA. From  the  king on down they humbled themselves before God, repented\n   of their sins, and cried to God for mercy.\n \n      But  let  man  and  beast  be  covered with sackcloth, and cry\n      mightily unto God: yea, let them turn every one from his  evil\n      way,  and  from  the violence that is in their hands.  Who can\n      tell  if  God  will  turn  and  repent, and turn away from his\n      fierce anger, that we perish not?                  Jonah 3:8-9\n \n \nQ. Did God hear their prayers?\n \nA. Yes.  God saved a great many people of Nineveh.\n \n \nQ. Can  I still cry to God for mercy so that I will not come into judg-\n   ment?\n \nA. Yes.   There is still time to become saved even though that time has\n   become very short.\n \n      How  shall  we escape, if we neglect so great salvation; which\n      at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed\n      unto us by them that heard him;                    Hebrews 2:3\n \n      In  God is my salvation and my glory: the rock of my strength,\n      and my refuge, is in God.   Trust in  him  at  all  times;  ye\n      people,  pour  out  your heart before him: God is a refuge for\n      us.                                               Psalm 62:7-8\n \n \n \n \n            A R E  Y O U  R E A D Y  T O  M E E T  G O D ?\n \n \n \nA  book  entitled  1994?,  written by Harold Camping, presents Biblical\ninformation that we may be very near the end of time.

A  number  of  minor\nchanges  have  been  made to its layout to facilitate computer printing\nand  distribution.  The only change to the text itself is the paragraph\nwhich  describes  the  way in which Biblical passages appear within the\ntext.    In  the  original  tract they appear in italic lettering; they\nappear here as indented paragraphs.\n \n \nI have read Mr. Camping's book, compared it with what the Bible actual-\nly  says, find it to be the most credible research with respect to what\nthe  future holds that I have ever come across, and agree with him that\nthere  is just too much data to ignore.  While none of us is guaranteed\none  more  second  of  life, and while we, therefore, should take these\nmatters  very seriously regardless of when Christ will actually return,\nit  would appear that our natural tendency to postpone caring about our\neternal  destiny  until we feel that our death is imminent is even more\nsenseless  now  because,  in  all  likelihood, the law of averages with\nrespect  to life expectancy no longer applies.  If you wish to obtain a\ncopy  of  this book so that you can check out these facts for yourself,\nyou may find the following information helpful:\n \n      title:       1994?\n      author:      Harold Camping\n      publisher:   Vantage Press\n      distributor: Baker and Taylor\n      ISBN:        0-533-10368-1\n \n \nI  have  chosen  to share this tract with you because I whole-heartedly\nagree with everything it declares and feel that now, perhaps more  than\never  before,  this information must be made known.  To paraphrase Acts\n20:27,  it  does not shun to declare unto us all the counsel of God.  I\nam  always  willing  to  discuss  the  eternal truths of the Bible with\nanyone who is interested as I believe them to be the only issues of any\nreal  importance since we will spend, comparatively speaking, so little\ntime  on this side of the grave and so much on the other.

I totally agree with that sentiment.  But why do you have to go further\nand advocate violating what God has set up?  That is the question which\nyou have not answered from Scripture.  You can worship on every day, as\nlong as you work.  But God says the Sabbath is all mine.
You might want to re-think your attitude about the Holocaust after\nreading Deuteronomy chapter 28.
I'd love to know how "Jesus only" proponents would answer questions like:\n\n-Who is this "Father" Jesus keeps referring to? Why does He call Himself "the\nSon"?\n\n-Why does He pray to the Father, and not to himself?\n\n-Why does He emphasize that he does his Father's will, and not his own?  If He\n was doing his own will, what kind of example is that?  Should we follow it?\n\n-When He says he has to return to the Father, who is He going to?\n\n-When He says he does this in order that the Comforter, the Holy Spirit might\n come, who might that be?\n\n-If He claims that the coming of the Holy Spirit is such a blessing that it's\n worth His leaving us and returning to the Father, what can that mean if there\n is no Holy Spirit?\n\n-Why doesn't the best known Christian prayer begin "Our Saviour, who art in\n heaven," rather than "Our Father?"\n\nDo they have answers to these questions that are even plausible?\n\n(Further entertaining queries are left as an exercise to the reader.)\n\n-drt\n\n-- \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n------------------------------------------------------------------------
[deleted]\n\nI can't speak for Mr. Cavano, but I understood his comment to refer to \nthe idea that unrecognized pantheism is dangerous to Christians.  If we \nunthinkingly adopt pantheistic ideas that are opposed to Christianity, \nwe can pervert our faith.  When we clearly recognize pantheism when we \nencounter it we have the opportunity to embrace what is consistent with \nChristianity and reject what isn't.    \n\nWe need to be alert, always thinking and questioning.  We must examine \nthe underlying assumptions of every book we read, tv program we watch \nand socio-political movement we participate in.  Ideas are important.  \nPhilosophies and doctrines are what give form to the events of our \nlives.  They are the basis from which we live our lives of love and \nservice.  The command to love God with all one's mind means no fuzzy-\nheaded drifting from idea to idea. \n\n\nOne Christian who acknowledges this is the Pope.  It is a frequent theme \nin his writings.  Indeed, thoughtful Christians from most traditions \nrecognize that consumerism has no place in the lives of Christians.  It \ntoo is a perversion and dangerous to our faith.  Thank you, Jack, for \npointing out the parallel.
I strongly disagree that absolute truth would not require interpretation.\nThat's because truth may be absolute, but it may not be obvious.  Like\nso many things, the truth is always subject to misinterpretation.\n\nI strongly suspect that we are reaching an impasse here, which is why I\ndeign from commenting much further.\n\n\nNow hold it.  I never said that Christians cannot be arrogant.  Indeed, as\nmany other Christians on SRC have stressed before, this is a trap that\nChristians must always be wary about.  However, this does not mean that if\nyou believe in the absolutes established by the Bible, you are necessarily\nbeing arrogant.  A Christian can believe that the Word of God is absolute,\nbut he or she should not expect this to be immediately evident to everyone.\n \n\nNot quite.  You say that according to my stance, we cannot *reliably*\ndetermine what is true.  That is not what I said.  I say that as fallible\nhuman beings, we cannot discern the truth with 100% certainty.  The \ndistinction is subtle yet important.\n\nWhen a scientist performs an experiment, he can claim that his results\nare reliable, without claiming that absolutely no mistake whatsoever could\nhave been made.  In other words, he can admit that he could be mistaken,\nwithout sacrificing his convictions.\n\nNobody can establish what absolute truth is with 100% certainty.\nThroughout the centuries, philosophers have argued about what we can know\nwith complete certainty and what we cannot.  Descartes made a step in the\nright direction when he uttered, "Cogito, ergo sum," yet we have not advanced\nmuch beyond that.\n\nDo you believe that other people aside from you exist?  Do you believe that\nthe computer terminal you are using exists?  If so, can you be absolutely\ncertain about that?  Are you sure it is not some grand illusion?  Of course,\nyou have no such assurance.  This does not mean, however, that for all\npractical purposes, you can be certain that they exist.  So it is with\nChristianity.  The most mature Christians I know have deep convictions about\nabsolute morality, yet they acknowledge that there is a non-zero probability \nthat they are wrong.  This does not, however, mean that they should (or do) \nabandon these absolutes.\n\n\nAs I said, we can never be absolutely certain that we are correct.  This does\nnot mean that we cannot be certain enough, in light of the evidence, to \nrender all doubts unreasonable.

Love your neighbor wether you like it\nor not.  I'd be happy to get flamed endlessly and loose scripture\nquotation contests galore to defend this point.  I beleive this is\ncorrect. \n\nBTW Love the sinner hate the sin is a slippery slope, with hatred at the\nbottom. \n\n\nINCREDIBLY CHOPPED UP POST\nI won't even try to tell you where the deletions came out\n\n\n\nI find that I am dissatisfied with the little purposes that we can\nmanufacture for ourselves.  Little in the cosmic sense.  Even the\ngreatest of the great pharos are long gone, the pyramids historical\noddities being worn down by the wind, eventually to be turned into dust.\nMankind itself will one day perish.  Without some interconnectedness\nthat transcends the physical, without God, it is all pointless in the\nend.  Most people are able to live with that, and for them little\npurposes (success, money, power, effecting change, helping others)\nsuffice.  I suppose they never  think about the cosmic scale, or are at\nleast able to put it out of their minds.\n\nTo me, it is comforting to know that reality is an illusion.  That the\ntrue reality underneath the the physical is spirit.  That this world is\na school of sorts, where we learn and grow, and our souls mature.  That\ngives a purpose to my little purposes, and takes some of the pressure\noff.  It's not so necessary to make this life a success in human terms\nif you're really just here to learn.  It's more important to progress,\ngrow, persist, to learn to love yourself and others and to express your\nlove, especially when it's dificult to do so.  Honest effort is rewarded\nby God, he knows our limitations.\n\n\n\nInteresting theological question.  I have a feeling that most common\nperception of eternal life is WAY off base.  If I were to be imprisoned\nin the limited ego/mind I am in now I doubt I would choose imortality. \nIt would get awfully boring.  \n\nTWO SERIOUS QUESTIONS/INVITATIONS TO DISCUSSION\n1. What is the nature of eternal life?\n2. How can we as mortals locked into space time conceive of it?
He who overcomes will inherit all this, and I will be his God and he will\nbe my son.
In <Apr.23.02.55.31.1993.3123@geneva.rutgers.edu>\nTim asks:\n\n   This is probably too simplistic for some, but John 3:16 saus,\n   "For God so loved the world that He gave His only son, that\n   whoever believes in Him should not perish but have eternal life".\n\n   Genesis 15:6, "And he (Abram) believed the LORD; and He reckoned\n   it to him as righteousness".\n\n   I don't find anywhere that God restricts heaven to particular\n   ethnic groups or religious denominations or any other category\n   that we humans like to drop people into. But He does REQUIRE\n   that we believe and trust Him. In Hebrews it says that God spoke\n   of old by the prophets (the old testament), but in these last days\n   he has spoken to us by His son Jesus Christ. And we learn of\n   Him through the pages of the New Testament. The Bible tells us\n   what we need to believe. For those who have never heard, I leave\n   them in God's capable care, He will make himself known as he\n   desires. It behooves each one of us to act upon the knowledge\n   we have. If you reject the claims of Jesus, and still go to\n   heaven, then the joke's on me. If you reject him and go to hell,\n   that's no joke, but it will be final.\n\n\n   Gerry
Dear Defiant (or Unfaithful or Pixie):\n\nI will take up the challenge to reply, as I am a theist.\n\nThe foundation for faith in God is reason, without which the existence\nof God could not be proven.  That His existence can be proven by reason\nis indisputable (cf. my short treatise, "Traditional Proofs for the \nExistence of God," and Summa Theologica).\n\nNow, given that God exists, and that His existence can be proven by reason,\nI assert that His commands must be followed blindly, although in our fallen\ncondition we must always have some measure of doubt about our faith.  Why?\n\nBecause God is the First Cause of all things, the First Mover of matter,\nthe Independent Thing that requires nothing else for its existence, the\nMeasure of all that is perfect, and the essential Being who gives order\nto the universe (logos).\n\nI next assert that God is all good.  If this is so, then that which is\ncontrary to the will of God is evil; i.e., the absence of the good.  And,\nsince God can never contradict Himself, then by His promise of a Savior\nas early as the Protoevangelium of Genesis 3:5, God instructs that because\na human (Adam) was first responsible for man's alienation from the Source\nof all good, a man would be required to act to restore the friendship.\nThus God became incarnate in the person of the Messiah.\n\nNow this Messiah claimed that He is the Truth (John 14:6).  If this claim\nis true, then we are bound by reason to follow Him, who is truth incarnate.\n\nYou next seem to have a problem with authority.  Have you tried the United\nStates Marine Corps yet?  I can tell you first-hand that it is an excellent\ninstructor in authority.  If you have not yet had the privilege, I will\nreply that the authority which is Truth Incarnate may never be questioned,\nand thus must be followed blindly.  One may NOT deny the truth.  For\nexample, when the proverbial apple fell on Isaac Newton's head, he could\nhave denied that it happened, but he did not.  The laws of physics must\nbe obeyed whether a human likes them or not.  They are true. \n\nTherefore, the Authority which is Truth may not be denied.\n\nQED\n \n-- \nboundary
THE EMPTY TOMB:  CAN WE TRUST IT?\n\n                   by the late Wilbur M. Smith, D.D.\n                              (1894-1977)\n\n          When Jesus was on Earth, He made an amazing prediction about\n     Himself, and frequently repeated it.  Let me quote it for you:\n\n                 Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son\n               of Man shall be betrayed unto the chief\n               priests and unto the scribes, and they shall\n               condemn Him to death, and shall deliver Him\n               to the Gentiles to mock, and to scourge, and\n               to crucify Him; and the third day He shall\n               rise again" (Matthew 20:18-19).\n\n          Wholly different from the normal experience of men, Jesus,\n     who had *never* done anything worthy of death, even deserving\n     reproval, knew He would die before He was 40 years of age.  He\n     knew the very city where He would die.  He knew that the religious\n     leaders of His own race would condemn Him to death.  He knew that\n     one of His own would betray Him.  He knew that before His actual\n     death took place He would be mocked and scourged.  He knew exactly\n     how He would die--*by crucifixion.*\n\n          All this is in itself remarkable.  But more amazing than the\n     minute particulars of His foreknowledge was what He predicted\n     would follow shortly after He was buried--*that He would rise\n     again.*  He even designated the time--on the third day.\n\n          But since it is on this central fact--the death and resurrec-\n     tion of Jesus Christ--that the whole truth or untruth of Chris-\n     tianity turns, let us examine it more closely.\n\n          The body of Jesus was embalmed in long sheets of cloth\n     between the layers of which a great abundance of spices and\n     ointments was distributed.  The body was placed in a tomb which\n     had never before been used, and a great stone was rolled against\n     the entrance.  The Jewish authorities, fully aware that Jesus had\n     predicted He would rise again, had the stone officially sealed and\n     on Saturday placed a guard before the tomb to prevent the\n     disciples from carrying away the body.  Early Sunday morning some\n     of the women who were faithful followers of Christ went out to the\n     tomb to further anoint the body.  To their utter astonishment,\n     they found the stone rolled away, the body gone.  They rushed back\n     to tell the disciples.  Shortly two of Jesus' friends, Peter and\n     John, utterly skeptical about the whole affair, came and found the\n     tomb empty, just as the women had said.  Even the guards came\n     hurrying into the city to tell the Sanhedrin that had hired them\n     to guard the tomb that the body was gone (Matthew 28:11).\n\n          How did this tomb become empty?\n\n          One of the most famous New Testament scholars in America--\n     professor of New Testament literature in a large theological\n     seminary--wrote to the author in answer to my question of *how*\n     the tomb became empty, and wrote it in a letter *not* marked by\n     bitterness or sarcasm, that he could no more explain how the tomb\n     became empty than he could explain how Santa Claus comes down the\n     chimney at Christmas time.\n\n          But he didn't realize that Santa Clause never did come down\n     any chimney at Christmas time, *because there never was a Santa\n     Claus!*  ...And there *is* a Jesus.  He died; He was buried in the\n     tomb of Joseph of Arimathea, and on Sunday the body was gone.\n\n          Those are facts of history.  No one can escape the responsi-\n     bility of coming to some conclusion about what really happened by\n     mentioning a myth we all abandoned before we were eight years old.\n\n          Another professor, Dr. Kirsopp Lake of Harvard University,\n     tried to explain the empty tomb by saying (what no other scholar\n     in the field of New Testament criticism has ventured to adopt)\n     that the women went to the wrong tomb.\n\n          The facts are these:\n\n          First, so far as we know, there was no other tomb nearby to\n     which by mistake they could have gone.\n\n          Second, it is contrary to all similar experience for three or\n     more people to forget the place where they have buried their\n     dearest loved one within less than three days.  Even if the women\n     did miss the tomb, when Peter and John came, did they too go to\n     the wrong tomb?\n\n          Third, were the soldiers *guarding* the wrong tomb?\n\n          There is, of course, a record of an attempt to escape the\n     evidence of the empty tomb in the New Testament itself.\n\n                  Now when they were going, behold, some\n               of the watch came into the city and showed\n               unto the chief priests all the things that\n               were done.  And when they were assembled\n               with the leaders and had taken counsel, they\n               gave large money unto the soldiers, Saying,\n               Say ye, His disciples came by night, and stole\n               Him away while we slept.  And if this come to\n               the governor's ears, we will persuade him, and\n               secure you.  So they took the money, and did\n               as they were taught:  and this saying is com-\n               monly reported among the Jews until this day\n               (Matthew 28:11-15).\n\n          This is a good illustration of many later attempts to escape the\n     fact that the tomb was empty.\n\n          You will notice at once that the chief priests and the elders never\n     questioned but that the tomb *was* empty.  They never even went out to\n     see if what the guards had reported was true--they *knew* it was true.\n\n          Another fact about this story makes it ridiculous to maintain that\n     the tomb was empty--the soldiers were told to say that Jesus' disciples\n     came and stole the body away *while they* (the soldiers) *were asleep!*\n\n          How could they know what was going on while they were asleep?\n     Obviously, such testimony would be valueless in any court.\n\n          Even aside from the shallowness and sordidness that make us reject\n     the explanation, the very character and the later history of the\n     disciples compel us to believe they did not steal and secretly carry away\n     the body of Jesus.\n\n          First, as Professor Heffern points out, the leaders of Judaism in\n     Jerusalem, who had put the Lord Jesus to death, had nothing to offer to\n     contradict these disciples as they continued to preach Jesus and His\n     resurrection--because all Jerusalem knew the tomb was empty.  If there\n     had been trickery here, sooner or later it would have been suspected,\n     then proved.\n\n          Second, surely *one* of the disciples, even *most* of them, would\n     have confessed the fraud under the terrific persecution they underwent.\n     It may be possible to live a lie, but men seldom die for a lie--and most\n     of these men did.\n\n          The result ultimately would have been that the message that Christ\n     had risen would have suffered the fate of all such unfounded stories--it\n     would have lost it *power.*  Instead, this truth swept the world, closed\n     pagan temples, won millions of disciples, brought hope to a despairing\n     humanity, was the very foundation truth of the early church, and is today\n     as believable and as freshly glorious as ever.\n\n          But not only did Jesus come alive again, He did not disappear to\n     leave the disciples speculating through all the subsequent days as to\n     what had happened to Him.\n\n          Instead, He appeared to them--literally, visibly, frequently.\n\n          He appeared to the women at the tomb on Resurrection morning\n     (Matthew 28:1-10); later that day to Mary Magdalene alone (John 20:11-\n     18); and to Simon Peter, also alone (Luke 24:34).  In the afternoon He\n     walked with two of His followers toward Emmaus (Luke 24:13-35); and that\n     night He appeared to ten of the apostles gathered together in an upper\n     room at Jerusalem (Mark 16:14-16; Luke 24:36-40; etc.).\n\n          A week later He appeared to all eleven of the apostles, probably at\n     the same place (John 20:26-28).  Once He was seen by above 500 brethren\n     on a mountain in Galilee (I Corinthians 15:6); and finally to the\n     apostles just before His ascension (Mark 16:19; Luke 24:50-52; Acts 1:3-\n     8).\n\n          As with the fact of the empty tomb, so in regard to these histor-\n     ically recorded appearances, all kinds of theories have been proposed\n     attempting to deny their literalness.  But these theories are\n     unreasonable, without supporting evidence.  None has ever won the\n     unanimous approval of those who refuse to believe in the reality of the\n     appearances.\n\n          Moreover, while it is true we are living in an age when may of our\n     leading scientists and agnostics and many of our philosophers are\n     antisuperanaturalistic, let us not forget that some of the greatest\n     thinkers of the ages have firmly believed in this great miracle.\n     Increase Mather, president of Harvard; Timothy Dwight, president of Yale;\n     Nathan Lord, president of Dartmouth; Edward Hitchcock, president of\n     Amherst; Mark Hopkins, president of Williams; John Witherspoon, president\n     of Princeton--these men and countless others have believed it.\n\n          But suppose Christ *did* rise from the dead, what of it?  What has\n     it to do with *my* life?  What has it to do with *your* life?  Just this:\n     it seals with certitude the teachings of Christ.\n\n          Jesus taught many great truths--especially many about Himself.  He\n     claimed to have come down *from* God.\n\n          He said He was the way *to* God.\n\n          He said He was the Son of God, who alone knew God perfectly.\n\n          He said that whoever believed on Him had eternal life, and no one\n     else had it.\n\n          He said that whatever we ask God in His name, He would grant it to\n     us.\n\n          Thus when He did rise from the grave on the third day, He revealed\n     that in these amazing, unparalleled predictions, *He spoke the truth!*\n\n          Do you know any reason, *any good reason,* why we should not believe\n     that His words are all true?\n\n          The point is, does not the truth of the Resurrection convince us\n     that He is none other than the One He claimed to be--the Son of God?\n\n          And then, of course, the fact that Christ rose from the dead\n     testifies that He has broken the power of death, and that He will some\n     day raise us also up from the grave, as He promised.\n\n          In other words, if this Person, Jesus Christ, the Son of God, in all\n     this, He should be the cornerstone of the foundation of your life.  For\n     He said a life built on Him would know forgiveness of sins, His compan-\n     ionship and help, a joy that no circumstances can ever take away, and a\n     hope that shineth more and more unto a perfect day.
J.N. Darby was one of the founders of the "Plymouth Brethren" and an\nearly supporter of dispensationalism.  F.F. Bruce highly approved\nof his translation.  He also translated the Bible into several other\nlanguages.\n\n\nThis was from the same fellow who did Young's Concordance, which was\na standard reference work, similar to Strong's concordance.\n\n\nI believe that these just follow standard reference works.\n\n\nSome are by Larry Pierce ("Brethren"), some are by Baptists, and I\nthink that Thompson (of chain reference fame) was Presbyterian)\n\n\nAnother standard reference work that has been around for decades.\nA new version was just released and is available through Christian\nBook Distributers.\n\n\nC.I. Scofield was the creator of the Scofield Reference Bible.  For many\npeople (but not me), this is THE STUDY BIBLE.  The notes are strongly\ndispensational.\n\n\nThese are probably the most accurate Strong's numbers available.
I have a hard time understanding this attitude.\n\nIf the gospels are the least bit accurate, then there can be little\ndoubt that Jesus belived hell was a reality.\n\nAs a teacher, what would be the wise and loving thing to do if people\nin your audience were headed there?  To warn them!  It would, however, \nbe rather cruel and/or sadistic to believe that such a place exists \nand then remain quiet about it.  \n\nThe only scenario I can envision in which dimished respect would be\njustified is if Jesus knew there was no such place as hell, and spoke\nabout it anyway, just to scare people. Unless you would accuse Jesus\nof this, I would encourage you to reconsider what a loving response \nis when you perceive someone to be in danger.
Vera Shanti Noyes writes;\n\n\nOf course I believe in Predestination.  It's a very biblical doctrine as\nRomans 8.28-30 shows (among other passages).  Furthermore, the Church\nhas always taught predestination, from the very beginning.  But to say\nthat I believe in Predestination does not mean I do not believe in free\nwill.  Men freely choose the course of their life, which is also\naffected by the grace of God.  However, unlike the Calvinists and\nJansenists, I hold that grace is resistable, otherwise you end up with\nthe idiocy of denying the universal saving will of God (1 Timothy 2.4). \nFor God must give enough grace to all to be saved.  But only the elect,\nwho he foreknew, are predestined and receive the grace of final\nperserverance, which guarantees heaven.  This does not mean that those\nwithout that grace can't be saved, it just means that god foreknew their\nobstinacy and chose not to give it to them, knowing they would not need\nit, as they had freely chosen hell.\n							  ^^^^^^^^^^^\nPeople who are saved are saved by the grace of God, and not by their own\neffort, for it was God who disposed them to Himself, and predestined\nthem to become saints.  But those who perish in everlasting fire perish\nbecause they hardened their heart and chose to perish.  Thus, they were\ndeserving of God;s punishment, as they had rejected their Creator, and\nsinned against the working of the Holy Spirit.\n\n\nWell, I would hold that as God most certainly gives everybody some\nblessing for what good they have done (even if it was only a little),\nfor those He can't bless in the next life, He blesses in this one.  And\nthose He will not punish in the next life, will be chastised in this one\nor in Purgatory for their sins.  Every sin incurs some temporal\npunishment, thus, God will punish it unless satisfaction is made for it\n(cf. 2 Samuel 12.13-14, David's sin of Adultery and Murder were\nforgiven, but he was still punished with the death of his child.)  And I\nneed not point out the idea of punishment because of God's judgement is\nquite prevelant in the Bible.  Sodom and Gommorrah, Moses barred from\nthe Holy Land, the slaughter of the Cannanites, Annias and Saphira,\nJerusalem in 70 AD, etc.\n\nnot a >good parallel, but i'm going to go with it anyway), why should we\nnot >stop the murder and violation of people who may (or may not) be more\n\nWe should stop the slaughter of the innocent (cf Proverbs 24.11-12), but\ndoes that mean that Christians should support a war in Bosnia with the\nU.S. or even the U.N. involved?  I do not think so, but I am an\nisolationist, and disagree with foreign adventures in general.  But in\nthe case of Bosnia, I frankly see no excuse for us getting militarily\ninvolved, it would not be a "just war."  "Blessed" after all, "are the\npeacemakers" was what Our Lord said, not the interventionists.  Our\nactions in Bosnia must be for peace, and not for a war which is\nunrelated to anything to justify it for us.
[..]\n\n\nHello.  Firstly, what do you exactly mean by "fundamentalist"?  I will\nfor the time being assume that what you mean is that your friend believes\nthat the bible is God's word to mankind?  I suspect that what happened\nto him is what he'll call being "born again"?  Anyway, was that recent?\nIf the answer is "yes" to all the questions above, it is quite\nunderstandable.  However, IMO, I'ld rather give advice to your friend!\nI think I've been through something similar to him, and one thing I can\nsay is that the basic problem is that each of you are now trying to\ncommunicate from different worldviews.  Why he talks about those things\nis because they are now "obvious" to him.  What is "obvious" to him is\nnot obvious to you.  Secondly, why he may be very persuasive is because\nfrom his point of view, he has been on "both sides of the fence".  This\nI mean that before he turned "fundamentalist", you two are agreeable\nbecause both of you see things from the same side.  If suddenly, as if\na new world of reality has suddenly opened up to him, it is like the\ndiscovery of let's say a new continent, or a new planet.  To him, he's\ngot to tell you because he has seen something much more wonderful than\nwhere he was, and what he thinks is much better than where you are now.\nYou have got to realise that from his point of view, he means well to\nyou, eventhough he may end up offending you.  To him, it is worth that\nrisk.  Nevertheless, it is really up to him to respect where you stand\nand listen to you as well.  At this moment, it may be difficult because\nhe is either very excited or feel it is too urgent to keep quiet about,\nhowever, he may not realise that he's really putting you off.\n\n[...]\n\n\nSo far, I've only been trying to explain things from his side.  However,\nI do understand how you feel too, because I wasn't a Christian for a good\npart of my life as well.  I was quite turned off by Christians or\n"fundamentalists" who were really all out and enthusiastic about their\nfaith.  They really scared me, to tell you the truth.  Unfortunately,\n"religious belief" is a very personal thing, just as your agnosticism\nis also a very personal thing to you.  Since the Christian belief is\ninevitably at odds with anything non-Christian (religious or otherwise),\nit will be a touchy matter.  Like all friendships, it will take both\nsides to do their part to make it work.  In this matter, maybe you can\ndo your part by telling him nicely that you are not able to dig what he's\ntrying to convince you about, that it's beyond you or not your concern\n"for now".  Don't tell him it's nonsense, because to him it is reality -\nand that would be a real insult.  He'll also have to be careful not to\ninsult where you stand too.\n\nLike I said before, I wish I could give your friend some advice too.\nI'll admit that I did similarly to some of my friends when I became a\nChristian.  In some ways, I wish I could have done things a little\ndifferently.  However, it was difficult then because I was so excited\nand just blabbered away about what I've found!  To me, it was too good\nnot to know.  To some, I was crazy, and I didn't really care most of\nthe time what they thought.  You will probably think he's crazy too -\nbut God is very real to him, as real as you are to him.  Keep that in\nmind.  And he thinks he can convince you because since God is so real\nto him, he doesn't see why God can't be real to you too.\n\nI don't know how helpful this is to you.  But all the best anyhow -\nthis is quite a challenge for you to face.  By the way, personal\nconviction: nobody is "beyond saving" except the one we call the \ndevil and his hosts.
Rick has nailed the problem down pretty well.\n\nAs I can find no Scripture (have I missed it ?) that details\nwhen you are married, I have to make some assumptions based\non the PRINCIPLES of Scripture.  \n\nIt seems to me that it takes 3 parties to make a marriage:\nhusband-to-be, wife-to-be, and God.  If you promise before\neach other and God that you will convenant together to be\nmarried, then...you are (IMO).\n\nSo why do we have the ceremonial part ?  That seems to be\nthere for "connectedness" in the Body of Christ.  My brothers\nand sisters ought to be involved so that there can be some\naccountability on both our parts.  That's part of the concept\nfrom Hebrews about "not forsaking the assembling of yourselves\ntogether as is the custom of some."  We need each other because\nLone Ranger Christians and Lone Ranger Marriages smack of a\nself sufficiency that the I don't see in the NT.  Does anyone\nsee the Paul Simon "I am a rock, I am an island..." model anywhere\nin Christianity. (Song lyrics show your age :-) ) ?\n\nFurther, since marriage is a legal matter/institution in the USA\nand many other places, and such laws do not specifically go\ncrosswise to the clear teachings of Scripture, we ought to\nobey them to avoid even the appearance of "evil" (I Thess 5:22)\n\nSo this would imply at least a civil ceremony before marriage,\nbut keep in mind we are at least doing all of this for the \nconscience of others because back to the beginning...you are\nmarried when you and your intended promise each other and God\nto be in convenant. (IMO)\n\nWhat ch'all think ?\n\nBobby - akgua!rjb
