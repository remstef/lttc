In regards to fractal commpression, I have seen 2 fractal compressed "movies".\nThey were both fairly impressive.  The first one was a 64 gray scale "movie" of\nCasablanca, it was 1.3MB and had 11 minutes of 13 fps video.  It was a little\ngrainy but not bad at all.  The second one I saw was only 3 minutes but it\nhad 8 bit color with 10fps and measured in at 1.2MB.\n\nI consider the fractal movies a practical thing to explore.  But unlike many \nother formats out there, you do end up losing resolution.  I don't know what\nkind of software/hardware was used for creating the "movies" I saw but the guy\nthat showed them to me said it took 5-15 minutes per frame to generate.  But as\nI said above playback was 10 or more frames per second.  And how else could you\nput 11 minutes on one floppy disk?
Actuallay I don't, but on the other hand I don't support the idea of having\none newsgroup for every aspect of graphics programming as proposed by Brian,\nin his reply to my original posting.\nI would suggest a looser structure more like a comp.graphics.programmer,\ncomp.graphics.hw_and_sw\nThe reason for making as few groups as possible is for the same reason you\nsay we shouldn't spilt up, not to get to few postings every day.\nI takes to much time to browse through all postings just to find two or \nthree I'm interested in.\n\nI understand and agree when you say you want all aspects of graphics in one\nmeeting. I agree to some extension. I see news as a forum to exchange ideas,\nhelp others or to be helped. I think this is difficult to achive if there\nare so many different things in one meeting.\n\nGood evening netters|-)
I'm working upon a game using an isometric perspective, similar to\nthat used in Populous.  Basically, you look into a room that looks\nsimilar to the following:\n\n                             xxxx\n                         xxxxx   xxxx\n                     xxxx    x       xxxx\n                 xxxx        x           xxxx\n             xxxx     2      xxxx     1      xxxx\n             x           xxxx    xxxx           x\n             x       xxxx            xxxx       x\n             x   xxxx             o      xxxx   x\n             xxxx              3 /|\         xxxx\n                 xxxx            /~\     xxxx\n                     xxxx            xxxx\n                         xxxx    xxxx\n                             xxxx\n\nThe good thing about this perspective is that you can look and move\naround in three dimensions and still maintain your peripheral vision. [*]\n\nSince your viewpoint is always the same, the routines can be hard-coded\nfor a particular vantage.  In my case, wall two's rising edge has a slope\nof 1/4. (I'm also using Mode X, 320x240).\n\nI've run into two problems; I'm sure that other readers have tried this\nbefore, and have perhaps formulated their own opinions:\n\n1) The routines for drawing walls 1 & 2 were trivial, but when I ran a\npacked->planar image through them, I was dismayed by the "jaggies."  I'm\nnow considered some anti-aliasing routines (speed is not really necessary).\nIs it worth the effort to have the artist draw the wall already skewed,\nthus being assured of nice image, or is this too much of a burden?\n\n2) Wall 3 presents a problem; the algorithm I used tends to overly distort\nthe original.  I tried to decide on paper what pixels go where, and failed.\nHas anyone come up with method for mapping a planar to crosswise sheared\nshape?\n\nCurrently I take:\n\n  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16\n 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32\n 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48\n 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64\n\nand produce:\n            \n             1  2  3  4\n33 34 35 36 17 18 19 20  5  6  7  8\n49 50 51 52 37 38 39 40 21 22 23 24  9 10 11 12\n            53 54 55 56 41 42 43 44 25 26 27 28 13 14 15 16\n                        57 58 59 60 45 46 47 48 29 30 31 32\n                                    61 62 63 64\n\nLine 1 follows the slope.  Line 2 is directly under line 1.\nLine 3 moves up a line and left 4 pixels.  Line 4 is under line 3.\nThis fills the shape exactly without any unfilled pixels.  But\nit causes distortions.  Has anyone come up with a better way?\nPerhaps it is necessary to simply draw the original bitmap\nalready skewed?\n\nAre there any other particularly sticky problems with this perspective?\nI was planning on having hidden plane removal by using z-buffering.\nLocations are stored in (x,y,z) form.\n\n[*] For those of you who noticed, the top lines of wall 2 (and wall 1)\n*are* parallel with its bottom lines.  This is why there appears to\nbe an optical illusion (ie. it appears to be either the inside or outside\nof a cube, depending on your mood).  There are no vanishing points.\nThis simplifies the drawing code for objects (which don't have to\nchange size as they move about in the room).  I've decided that this\napproximation is alright, since small displacements at a large enough\ndistance cause very little change in the apparent size of an object in\na real perspective drawing.\n\nHopefully the "context" of the picture (ie. chairs on the floor, torches\nhanging on the walls) will dispell any visual ambiguity.\n\nThanks in advance for any help.
Hi to all out there.  We have this problem, and I'm not certain I'm solving it\nin the correct way.  I was wondering if anyone can shed light on this, or point\nme in the right place to look...\n\nWe have an X-ray imaging camera and a metallic tube with a cylindrical hole\npassing through it at a right angle to the tube's axis:\n\n                                                          |\n                                     ||                   [ image\n                                                          |\n  X-ray source ]                     ||                   | screen\n                            metallic || tube              |\n                                     ||                   |\n                                                          |\n\nWe know source--screen centre distance, radius of the tube, radius of the hole.\n\nWe do some calculations based on the image of the hole on the screen.  However,\nthe calculations are mathematically highly complex, and must assume that the\nobject's hole projects an image (resembling an ellipse if the tube is not\nparallel to the screen) in the centre of the screen.  However, it is unlikely\nthat the object is placed so conveniently.  \n\nFirstly, we must transform the major and minor axis of the ellipse.  I cannot\nknow what the angle between the tube and screen is.  Do I have to assume that\nthey are parallel to do the transformation?  How do I do this transformation?\n\nSecondly, there is a distortion of the image due to the screen being planar\n(the source--screen distance increases as we move away from the centre of the\nscreen).  How can I compensate the ellipse's axis for this image distortion?\n\nSo, please can anyone give us a few pointers here?  How do we transform the\nimage so it appears as it would if it were in the centre of the screen, and how\ndo I deal with distortion due to the shape of the screen?\n\nWe'd appreciate any help, either posted or emailed.\n\nThanks in advance, Simon.
They are 3D object files for CAD 3D 2.0, a program written by Tom Hudson\nfor the Atari ST computers.  Don't know much more about them except that\nthey are stored with the points first, then the surfaces are next, and are\nmade by listing 3 point numbers that make up the triangle surface. Then\nthere's a header that describes coloring, lighting, etc.  Don't know much\nmore than this, hope this helps.
Hello everybody !\n\nIf you are using PIXAR'S RenderMan 3D scene description language for creating 3D worlds, please, help me. \n\nI'm using RenderMan library on my NeXT but there is no documentation about NeXTSTEP version of RenderMan available. I can create very complicated scenes and render them using surface shaders, \nbut I can not bring them to life by applying shadows and reflections.\n\nAs far as I understand I have to define environmental and shadows maps to produce reflections and shadows, but I do not know how to use them.\n\nAny advises or simple RIB or C examples will be appreciated.\nThanks in advance...
Yeah, Corel Draw and WordPerfect Presentations pretty limited here, too.\n	Since there's no (not really) such thing as a decent raster to\nvector conversion program, this "tracing" technique is about it.  Simple\nstuff, like b&w logos, etc. do pretty well, while more complicated stuff\ngoes haywire.  I suspect (even though I don't write code) that a good\nbitmapped to vector conversion program would probably be as big as most\nof these application softwares we're using -- but even so, how come one\nhasn't been written? (to my knowledge).  I mean, even Hijaak, one of the\ncommercial industry standards of file conversion, hasn't attempted it yet.

I've been trying to figure out a way to get Adobe Illustrator\nto auto-trace >exactly< what I see on my screen. But it misses\nthe edges of templates by as many as 6 pixels or more - resulting in images\nthat are useless  - I need exact tracing, not approximate.\n\nI've tried adjusting the freehand tolerances as well as autotrace\ntolerances but it doesn't help. Any suggestions?
Getting an image from a computer monitor to a videotape\nis harder than it looks.  The standard VGA and EGA outputs are \nvery different than the NTSC format used by televisions.  While\nthere is equipment that will do the conversion, it is hard to\nget your hands on and costs quite a bit.\n\n	If you have access to an Amiga computer, that has an\nNTSC output, you can transfer certain types of graphic files by\nmodem and tape them from the NTSC output.  Unfortunately, this\nwould be frame-by-frame and would lead to unbelievably scratchy\nanimation unless you had a good Amiga animation program.
Yeah, and it's also true most long complicated sequences of events,\ncalculations, or big computer programs in general.  I don't argue\nthat you can get similar and maybe useful results from fractals, I\njust question whether you >should<.\n\nThe fractal fiends seem to be saying that any part of a system that we\ncan't model should be replaced with a random number generator.  That\nhas been useful, for instance, in making data more palatable to human\nperception or for torture testing the rest of the system, but I don't\nthink it has much to do with fractals, and I certainly would rather\nthat the model be improved in a more explicable manner.\n\nI guess I just haven't seen all these earth-shaking fractal models\nthat explain and correlate to the universe as it actually exists.  I\nreally hope I do, but I'm not holding my self-similar breath.\n\n\nUh huh.  I'll believe it when I see it.  I've been chasing fractal\ncompression for a few years, and I still don't believe in it.  If it's so\ngreat, how come we don't see it competing with JPEG?  'Cause it can't,\nI'll wager.\n\nActually, I have wagered, I quit trying to make fractal compression\nwork- and I was trying- because I don't think it's a reasonable\nalternative to other techniques.  It is neat, though. :-)\n\nI'll reiterate my disbelief that everything is fractal.  That's why I\ndon't think fractal compression as it is widely explained is\npractical.  I know Barnsley and Sloan have some tricks up their\nsleeves that make their demos work, but I don't see anyone using it in a\nreal product.  It's been six years since Iterated Systems was formed,\nright?\n\n	"There are always going to be questions until there's a product\n	out there," Sloan replies.  The company plans to ship its first\n	encoding devices in the summer, he says.  In March, Iterated\n	Systems will have the other half of the system: the decoders.\n\n		- Scientific American, March 1990, page 77

I am setting up a video-aid for a computer room for the teacher to share his\ndisplay with the class.\n\nI have seen people using video projector, TV sets and large monitor to do\npresentations before.

(1) No explicit (c) is necessary.  If it the image is attributed to the\nGeosphere Company, then there is a likelihood permission is has been\ngiven to reprint.\n\n(2) Unlikely that the owner can or will go after individuals.\nHowever, "interesting" images do make their way into ads and\ncomputer demos. That is when a pirate might get some flak.\nThis image is considered so "interesting" that many people would\nlike to use it whenever some global map is needed, so there\nis lots of temptation.\n\n(3) One mail person said since the source data- satellite imagery-\nis not copyrighted, then the derived image can't be.  Not true.\nA new, distinctive, creative expression of the data can be protected.\nThis image is certainly fits such, since NO ONE ELSE has taken the\ntremendous effort to re-create it themselves.  Precedent is a recent\ntelephone book court case.  Ma Bell tried to copyright the data in\ntheir books and prevent competitors from copying it (there are\ntrick entries in the book).  But the court only permitted copyright\nof the expression of the data, and not the data themselves. (You cant\nxerox and sell the telephone book.)\n\n(4) There will be more attention to digital copyrights in the future\nand computer becomes a mass product and moguls such as Bill Gates\nare currently hoarding the digital copyrights.

I am seeking some alternate solutions on how to turn a Postscript Type 1 or\nTrueType font outline into polygons that can be subsequently scan converted\nby a 3D scanline renderer. \n\nI have been studying the problem of font conversion for a few years but\nhave never had the need to implement such a system. Well, I now have the\nopportunity to write some font rendering software so I would like to have\nsome of my questions answered before I jump into the deep end.\n\nThe main problem I face is how to use the even/odd or non-winding rules to\nturn the outlines into a single outline polygon (my renderer can handle\ncomplex polygons so there is no need to reduce the polygons to simple\npolygons). For example, in the letter "O" there are two outlines:\n\n	1) The outside outline which is clockwise (TrueType font)\n	2) The inside outline which is counterclockwise.\n\nOne common solution used by a number of rendering packages is to simply \nconnect the inner outline to the outer outline at the point where the\ntwo outlines are closest. This is equivalent to descibing a "polygon with\nholes". The renderer will then make the appropriate hole since the interior\npolygon edges are in the opposite direction to the outside edges.\n\nI do not want to use this simplistic system since:\n\n	1) It will not handle all outline fonts properly (it is not a simple\n		matter to connect the outer outline to the inner outline for\n		some fancy fonts).\n	2) It does not properly handle the even/odd or non-winding rules.\n\nFrom my research over the years the proper solution is to use a trapezoid\ndecomposition algorithm to scan convert the outlines into trapezoids (as\nis done by the Postscript and TrueType font rasterizers). These trapezoidal\npolygons can then be easily and properly rendered by the 3D scanline renderer.\n\nMy question is: are there any better solutions to turning the outlines into\npolgyons other than the trapezoid decomposer? I am not fond of this solution\nsince it creates excess number of polygons.\n\nAnother question, for those in the know: what is the best algorithm to create\nbevelled and/or offset curves for font outlines? I have a dozen papers on these\nsubjects but I can't tell which method is the best to implement.\n\nThanks for any pointers.\n\n--> Rob Lansdale

Features\n===========\n\nDMPEG/DMPLAY is another MPEG decoder/player for the PC:\n\n\n - decodes (nearly) the full MPEG video standard\n   (I,P,B frames, frame size up to at least 352x240 supported)\n\n - saves decoded sequence in 8 or 24bit raw file for later display\n\n - optional on-screen display during decoding (requires VGA)\n\n - several dithering options: ordered dither, Floyd-Steinberg, grayscale\n\n - color-space selection\n\n - runs under DOS, 640KB RAM, no MS-Windows required\n\n - very compact (small code / small data models, 16 bit arithmetic)\n\n - real time display of the raw file by a separate player for\n   VGA and many Super-VGAs\n\n...\n\n4. Technical information\n========================\n\nThe player is a rather straightforward implementation of the MPEG spec [1].\nThe IDCT is based on the Chen-Wang 13 multiplication algorithm [2]\n(not quite the optimum, I know). Blocks with not more than eight non-zero\ncoefficients use a non-separated direct multiply-accumulate 2D-IDCT\n(sounds great, doesn't it?), which turned out to be faster than a 'fast'\nalgorithm in this (quite common) case. Dithering is pretty standard. Main\ndifference to the Berkeley decoder (except for the fewer number of supported\nalgorithms) is the use of 256 instead of 128 colors, the (default) option to\nuse a restricted color-space and the implementation of a color saturation\ndominant ordered dither. This leads to a significantly superior quality of\nthe dithered image (I claim, judge yourself).\n\nRestricted color-space means that the U and V components are clipped to\n+/-0.25 (instead of +/-0.5) and the display color-space points are distributed\nover this restricted space. Since the distance between color-space points\nis thus reduced by a factor of two, the color resolution is doubled at the\nexpense of not being able to represent fully saturated colors.\n\nSaturation dominant ordered dither is a method by which a color, lying\nsomewhere between the points of the display color space, is approximated\nby primarily alternating between two points of constant hue instead of\nconstant saturation. This yields subjectivly better quality due to the\nlower sensitivity of the human viewing system to saturation changes than\nto hue changes (the same reasoning as used by the PAL TV standard to improve\non NTSC). The improvement is particularly visible in dark brown or redish\nareas.\n\n...
Yep... Alchemy works fine on my Tseng400+DAC, but I think I remember\nreading that it only displays in 15-bit or so.  Of course, that's still 32K\ncolors which is nothing to sneeze at.

I am currently looking for a 3D graphics library that runs on MS\nWindows 3.1.  Are there any such libraries out there other than\nVisuallib?  (It must run on VGA and should not require any other\nadd-on graphics cards).\n\nFor Visuallib, will it run with Metaware High C compiler v3.0?  Any\nemail contact for the author of Visuallib?\n\nAny help would be much appreciated.  Thanks.
Hi:\n\nI am digitizing a NTSC signal and displaying on a PC video monitor.\nIt is known that the display response of tubes is non-linear and is\nsometimes said to follow Gamma-Law. I am not certain if these\nnon-linearities are "Gamma-corrected" before encoding NTSC signals\nor if the TV display is supposed to correct this.\n \nAlso, if  256 grey levels, for example, are coded in a C program do\nthese intensity levels appear with linear brightness on a PC\nmonitor? In other words does PC monitor display circuitry\ncorrect for "gamma errrors"?\n \nYour response is much appreciated.\n \nAmjad.
This past week I've been playing with some of the R-D (Reaction-\nDiffusion, not to be confused with RDS or R&D) techniques\nfrom SIGGRAPH '91.\n\nI was wondering what material is available to explain the control\nmechanism a little more.  It seems to me very much like a matter of\npicking random magic numbers and sitting back and waiting.  Although\nboth of the papers (Turk and Witkin & Kass) were very well organized\nand extremely helpful, I guess what I need is a more basic description\nof the technique, especially wrt the control mechanisms.  The tests\nthat I did had a tendency to either turn into blurry mud or become\nunstable.\n\nIs there any info available online?  Source code would be great but\nnot necessary.\n\nThanks!\n\n\n--
I usually use "Algorithms for graphics and image processing" by\nTheodosios Pavlidis, but other people here got them same idea and now\n3 of 4 copies in the libraries have been stolen!\n\nAnother reference is "Digital Image Processing" by Gonzalez and\nWintz/Wood, which is widely available but a little expensive ($55\nhere- I just checked today).

It depends on what kind of the polygons. \n	Convex - simple, concave - trouble, concave with loop(s)\n	inside - big trouble.\n\n	Of cause, you can use the box test to avoid checking\n	each edges. According to my experience, there is not\n	a simple way to go. The headache stuff is to deal with\n	the special cases, for example, the overlapped lines.

Plotting packages\n=====================\n\nGnuplot 3.2\n-----------\n  It is one of the best 2- and 3-D plotting packages, with\n  online help.It's a command-line driven interactive function plotting utility\n  for UNIX, MSDOS, Amiga, Archimedes, and VMS platforms (at least!).\n  Freely distributed, it supports many terminals, plotters, and printers\n  and is easily extensible to include new devices.\n  It was posted to comp.sources.misc in version 3.0, plus 2 patches.\n  You can practically find it everywhere (use Archie to find a site near you!).\n  The comp.graphics.gnuplot newsgroup is devoted to discussion of Gnuplot.\n\nXvgr and Xmgr (ACE/gr)\n-----------------------\n  Xmgr is an XY-plotting tool for UNIX workstations using\n  X or OpenWindows. There is an XView version called xvgr for\n  Suns. Collectively, these 2 tools are known as ACE/gr.\n  Compiling xmgr requires the Motif toolkit version 1.1\n  and X11R4 - xmgr will not compile under X11R3/Motif 1.0x.\n\n  Check at ftp.ccalmr.ogi.edu [129.95.72.34} in\n  /CCALMR/pub/acegr/xmgr-2.09.tar.Z (Motif version)\n  /CCALMR/pub/acegr/xvgr-2.09.tar.Z (XView version)\n\n  Comments, suggestions, bug reports to Paul J Turner\n  <pturner@amb4.ese.ogi.edu> (if mail fails, try pturner@ese.ogi.edu).\n  Due to time constraints, replies will be few and far between.\n\nRobot\n-----\n  Release 0.45 : 2-D and limited 3-D.

It provides a\n  graphical programming environment using block diagram sketch is the\n  "program" with graphical elements representing the programming elements.\n  Hundreds of functions are already available and are connected using a\n  wiring tool to create the block diagram (program).  Functions that the\n  block diagrams represent include digital signal processing and\n  filtering, numerical analysis, statistics, etc.  The tool allows any\n  Virtual Instrument (VI, a software file that looks and acts like a real\n  laboratory instrument) to be used as a part of any other virtual\n  instrument.\n\n  National Instruments markets plug-in digital signal processing (DSP)\n  boards for Macintoshs and PC compatables that allow real-time\n  acquisition and analysis at a personal computer.  New software tools for\n  DSP are allowing engineers to harness the power of this technology. The\n  tools range from low-level debugging software to high-level block\n  diagram development software.  There are three levels of DSP programming\n  associated with the NB-DSP2300 board and LabVIEW:\n  Use of the NB-DSP2300 Analysis Library: FFTs, power spectra, filters\n  routines callable from THINK C and Macintosh Programers Workshop (MPW) C\n  that execute on the NB-DSP2300 board. There is an analysis Virtual\n  Interface Library of ready-to-use VIs optimized for the NB-DSP2300.\n\n  Use of the National Instruments Developers Toolkit that includes an\n  optimizing C compiler, an assembler and a linker for low-level\n  programming of the DSP hardware.  This approach offers the highest level\n  of performance but is the must difficult in terms of ease of use.\n\n  Use of the National Instruments Interface Kit software package which has\n  utility functions for memory management data communications and\n  downloading code to the NB-DSP2300 board. (This is the easiest route for\n  the development of custom code.)\n\nUltimage Concept VI\n-------------------\n  Concept VI  by Graftek-France is a family of image processing Virtual\n  Instruments (VIs) that give LabVIEW 2 (described above) users high-end\n  tools for designing, integrating and monitoring imaging control systems.\n  A VI is a software file that looks and acts like a real laboratory\n  instrument. Typical applications for Concept VI include thermography,\n  surveillance, machine vision, production testing, biomedical imaging,\n  electronic microscopy and remote sensing.\n\n  Ultimage Concept VI addresses applications which require further\n  qualitative and quantitative analysis.  It includes a complete set of\n  functions for image enhancement, histogram equalization, spatial and\n  frequency filtering, isolation of features, thresholding, mathematical\n  morphology analysis, density measurement, object counting, sizing and\n  characterization.\n\n  The program loads images with a minimum resolution of 64 by 64, a pixel\n  depth of 8, 16, or 32 bits, and one image plane.  Standard input and\n  output formats include PICT, TIFF, SATIE, and AIPD.  Other formats can\n  be imported.\n\n  Image enhancement features include lookup table transformations, spatial\n  linear and non-linear filters, frequency filtering, arithmetic and logic\n  operations, and geometric transformations, among others.  Morphological\n  transformations include erosion, dilation, opening, closing, hole\n  removal, object separation, and extraction of skeletons, among others.\n  Quantitative analysis provides for objects' detection, measurement, and\n  morphological distribution.  Measures include area, perimeter, center of\n  gravity, moment of inertia, orientation, length of relevant chords, and\n  shape factors and equivalence.  Measures are saved in ASCII format.  The\n  program also provides for macro scripting and integration of custom\n  modules.\n\n  A 3-D view command plots a perspective data graph where image intensity\n  is depicted as mountains or valleys in the plot.  The histogram tool can\n  be plotted with either a linear or logarithmic scale. The twenty-eight\n  arithmetic and logical operations provide for: masking and averaging\n  sections of images, noise removal, making comparisons, etc.  There are\n  13 spatial filters that alter pixel intensities based on local\n  intensity.  These include high-pass filters for contrast and outlines.\n  The frequency data resulting from FFT analysis can be displayed as\n  either the (real , imaginary ) components or the (phase, magnitude)\n  data.  The morphological transformations are useful for data sharpening\n  and defining objects or for removing artifacts.\n\n  The transformations include: thresholding, eroding, dilating and even\n  hole filling.\n\n  The program's quantitative analysis measurements include: area,\n  perimeter, center of mass, object counts, and angle between points.\n\n  GTFS, Inc. 2455 Bennett Valley Road #100C Santa Rosa, CA 95494\n  707-579-1733\n\nIPLab Spectrum\n--------------\n  IPLAB Spectrum supports image processing and analysis but lacks the\n  morphology and quantitative analysis features provided by\n  Graftek-FranceUs Ultimage Concept VI.  Using scripting tools, the user\n  tells the system the operations to be performed. The problem is that far\n  too many basic operations require manual intervention. The tool\n  supports: FFTs, 16 arithmetic operations for pixel alteration, and a\n  movie command for cycling through windows.\n\n\nMacintosh-based tools\n=====================\n\nNCSA Image, NCSA PalEdit and more\n---------------------------------\n  NCSA provides a whole suite of public-domain visualization tools for the\n  Macintosh, primarily aimed at researchers wanting to visualize results\n  from numerical modelling calculations.  These applications,\n  documentation, and source code are available for anonymous ftp from\n  ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu.

Using a frame grabber card, it can record sequences of\n  images to be played back as a movie. It can invoke user-defined\n  convolution matrix filters, such as Gaussian. It can import raw\n  data in tab-delimited ASCII, or as 1 or 2-byte quantities. It also\n  does histograms and even 3-D plots. It is limited to 8-bits/pixel,\n  though the 8 bits map into a color lookup table. It runs on any Mac\n  that has a 256-color screen and a FPU (or get the NonFPU version\n  from zippy.nimh.nih.gov)\n\nPhotoMac\n--------\n  Data Translation, Inc. 100 Locke Dr. Marlboro, MA 01752 508-481-3700\n\nPhotoPress\n----------\n  Blue Solutions 3039 Marigold Place Thousand Oaks, CA 91360 805-492-9973\n\nPixelTools and TCL-Image\n------------------------\n  "Complete family of PixelTools (hardware accelerator and applications\n  software) for scientific image processing and analysis.

Once an image has been imported it can be Rre-touchedS with\n  various editing tools typical of those used in Macintosh-based RpaintS\n  applications.  These include an eraser, pencil, brush and air brush.\n  Advanced RpasteS tools that control the interaction between a pasted\n  selection and the receiving site have also been incorporated.  For\n  example, all red pixels in a selection can easily be preventing from\n  being pasted. Photoshop has transparencies ranging from 0 to 100%,\n  allowing you to create ghost overlays.  RPhoto-editingS tools include\n  control of the brightness and contrast, color balancing, hue/saturation\n  modification and spectrum equalization.  Images can be subjected to\n  various signal processing algorithms to smooth or sharpen the image,\n  blur edges, or locate edges.  Image scaling is also supported.\n\n  For storage savings, the images can be compressed using standard\n  algorithms, including externally supplied compression such as JPEG,\n  availlable from Storm Technologies. The latest version of Adobe\n  Photoshop supports the import of numerous image formats including: EPSF,\n  EPSF, TIFF, PICT resource, Amiga IFF/ILBM, CompuServe GIF, MacPaint,\n  PIXAR, PixelPaint, Scitex CT, TGA and ThunderScan..\n\n  Adobe Systems, Inc. 1585 Charlestown Road PO Box 7900 Mountain View, CA\n  94039-7900 415-961-4400\n\nColorStudio and ImageStudio\n---------------------------\n  ColorStudio is an image-editing and paint package from Letraset that has\n  more features than Adobe Photoshop but is decidedly more complex and\n  therefore more difficult to use.  Several steps are often required to\n  accomplish that which can be done in a single step using Photoshop.  The\n  application requires a great deal of available disk space as one can\n  easily end up with images in the 30 MB range.  The program provides a\n  variety of powerful selection tools including the "auto selection tool"\n  which lets the user choose image areas on the basis of color, close\n  hues, color range and mask.\n\nImageStudio: Don't know...\n\n  Letraset USA 40 Eisenhower Drive Paramus, NJ 07653 201-845-6100\n\nDapple Systems\n--------------\n  "High resolution image analysis software provides processing tools to\n  work with multiple images, enhance and edit, and measure a variety of\n  global or feature parameters, and interpret the data."\n\n  Dapple Systems, 355 W.

One such feature allows the user to\n  select part of an image simply by "painting" it. A new polyline\n  selection tool creates a selection tool for single pixel wide\n  selections.  A brush lets the operator "paint" with a selected portion\n  of the image. Note that this is not a true color image enhancement tool.\n  This tool should be used when the user intends to operate in grey-scale\n  images only.

Image Analyst lets users configure\n  sophisticated image processing and measurement routines without the\n  necessity of knowing a programming language.  It is designed for such\n  tasks at computing number and size of cells in images projected by video\n  cameras attached to microscopes, or enhancing and measuring distances in\n  radiographs.\n\n  Image Analyst provides users with an array of field-proven video\n  analysis techniques that enable them to easily assemble a sequence of\n  instructions to enhance feature appearance; count objects; determine\n  density, shape, size, position, or movement; perform object feature\n  extraction; and conduct textural analysis automatically.  Image Analyst\n  works with either a framegrabber board and any standard video camera, or\n  a disk-stored image.\n\n  Within minutes, without the need for programming, the Image Analyst user\n  can set up a process to identify and analyze any element of a image.\n  Measurements and statistics can be automatically or semi-automatically\n  generated from TIFF or PICT files or from captured video tape images.\n  Image Analyst recognizes items in images based on their size, shape and\n  position.  The tool provides direct support for the Data Translation and\n  Scion frame grabbers. A menu command allows for image capture from a VCR\n  video camera or other NTSC or PAL devices.\n\n  There are 2 types of files, the image itself and the related Sequence\n  file that holds the processing, measurements and analysis that the user\n  defines.  Automated sequences are set up in Regions Of Interest (ROI)\n  represented by movable, sizable boxes atop the image.  Inside a ROI, the\n  program can find the distance between two edges, the area of a shape,\n  the thickness of a wall, etc.  Image Analyst finds the center, edge and\n  other positions automatically. The application also provides tools so\n  that the user can work interactively to find the edge of object. It also\n  supports histograms and a color look-up table (CLUT) tool.\n\n  Automatix, Inc. 775 Middlesex Turnpike Billerica, MA 01821 508-667-7900\n\nIPLab\n-----\n  Signal Analytics Corp. 374 Maple Ave. E Vienna, VA  22180 703-281-3277\n  FAX 703-281-2509\n\n  "Menu-driven image processing software that supports 24-bit color or\n  pseudocolor/grayscale image display and manipulation."\n\nMAP II\n------\n  Among the Mac GIS systems, MAP II distributed by John Wiley has\n  integrated image analysis.\n\nIMAGE\n-----\n  from Stanford : Try anonymous ftp from sumex-aim.stanford.edu\n  It has pd source for image v2, and ready to run code for a mac under\n  image v3.\n\n\n\nWindows/DOS PC-based tools\n==========================\n\nCCD\n---\n  Richard Berry's CCD imaging book for Willamon-Bell contains (optional?)\n  disks with image manipulating software.

Documentation (PostScript mostly)\n  available via anonymous ftp to baboon.cv.nrao.edu (192.33.115.103),\n  directory pub/aips and pub/aips/TEXT/PUBL.  Installation requires building\n  the system and thus a Fortran and C compiler.\n     This package can read and write FITS data (see sci.astro.fits), and is\n  primarily for reduction, analysis, and image enhancement of Radio Astronomy\n  data from radio telescopes, particularly the Very Large Array (VLA), a\n  synthesis instrument.  It consists of almost 300 programs that do everything\n  from copying data to sophisticated deconvolution, e.g. via maximum entropy.\n  There is an X11-based Image tool (XAS) and a tek-compatible xterm-based\n  graphics tool built into AIPS.  The XAS tool is modelled after the hardware\n  functionality of the International Imaging Systems model 70 display unit and\n  can do image arithmetic, etc.\n    The code is mostly Fortran 77 with some system C language modules, and is\n  available for Suns, IBM RS/6000, Dec/Ultrix, Convex, Cray (Unicos), and\n  Alliant with support planned for HP-9000/7xx, Solaris 2.1, and maybe SGI.\n     There is currently a project - "AIPS++" - underway to rewrite the\n  algorithmic functionality of AIPS in a modern setting, using C++ and an\n  object oriented approach.  Whereas AIPS is proprietary code (licensed for\n  free to non-profit institutions) owner by NRAO and the NSF, AIPS++ will be\n  in the public domain at some level, as it is an international effort with\n  contributions from the US, Canada, England, the Netherlands, India, and\n  Australia to name a few. \n\nLABOimage\n---------\n  (version 4.0 is out for X11) It's written in C, and currently\n  runs on Sun 3/xxx, Sun 4/xxx (OS3.5, 4.0 and 4.0.3) under SunView.\n  The expert system for image segmentation is written in Allegro Common Lisp.\n  It was used on the following domains: computer science (image analysis), \n  medicine, biology, physics.

All functions can be easily accessed via the\n  DISIMP executive. This menu is modular in design and groups image\n  processes by their function. Such a logical structure means that\n  complicated processes are simply a progression through a series of\n  modules.\n\n  Processes include image rectification, classification (unsupervised and\n  supervised), intensity transformations, three dimensional display and\n  Principal Component Analysis. DISIMP also supports the more simple and\n  effective enhancement techniques of filtering, band subtraction and\n  ratioing.\n\n  Host Configuration Requirements\n\n  Running on UNIX workstations, DISIMP is capable of processing the more\n  computational intensive techniques in interactive processing times.\n  DISIMP is available in both Runtime and Programmer's environments. Using\n  the Programmers environment, utilities can be developed for specific\n  applications programs.\n\n  Graphics are governed by an icon-based Display Panel which allows quick\n  enhancments of a displayed image. Manipulations of Look Up Tables,\n  colour stretches, changes to histograms, zooming and panning can be\n  interactively driven through this control.\n\n  A range of geographic projections enables DISIMP to integrate data of\n  image, graphic and textual types. Images can be rectified by a number of\n  coordinate systems, providing the true geographic knowledge essential\n  for ground truthing. Overlays of grids, text and vector data can be\n  added to further enhance referenced imagery.\n\n  The system is a flexible package allowing users of various skill levels\n  to determine their own working environment, including the amount of help\n  required. DISIMP comes fully configured with no optional extras. The\n  purchase price includes all functionality required for professional\n  processing of remote sensed data.\n\n  For further information, please contact:\n\n  The Business Manager, CLOUGH Engineering Group Systems Division, 627\n  Chapel Street, South Yarra, Australia 3141.

It  handles  sequences  of  images\n  (movies)  in precisely the same manner as single frames.\n\n  Programs and subroutines have been developed  for simple image\n  transformations, filtering, convolution, Fourier and other transform\n  processing, edge detection  and line  drawing   manipulation, digital\n  image compression and transmission  methods, noise generation, and image\n  statistics computation. Over 150 such  image transformation programs\n  have been developed.  As a result, almost any image processing  task\n  can be performed quickly and conveniently. Additionally, HIPS allows\n  users to easily integrate  their  own custom  routines.   New users\n  become effective using HIPS on their first day.\n\n  HIPS features images that are  self-documenting.   Each image stored  in\n  the  system  contains  a  history  of the transformations that have been\n  applied to that image.   HIPS includes  a  small  set of subroutines\n  which primarily deals with a standardized  image sequence  header,  and\n  a  large library  of  image  transformation tools in the form of UNIX\n  ``filters''.  It comes complete with source  code,  on-line manual\n  pages, and on-line documentation.\n\n  Host Configuration Requirements\n\n  Originally  developed at  New  York  University,  HIPS  now represents\n  one of the most extensive and flexible vision and image  processing\n  environments currently available.  It runs under the UNIX operating\n  system.  It is modular  and  flexible, provides automatic documentation\n  of its actions, and is almost entirely independent of special equipment.\n  HIPS is now in use on a variety of computers including Vax and\n  Microvax, Sun, Apollo,  Masscomp,  NCR Tower, Iris, IBM AT, etc.\n  For image display and input, drivers are supplied for the Grinnell and\n  Adage (Ikonas) image processors, and the Sun-2, Sun-3, Sun- 4, and\n  Sun-386i consoles.  We also  supply  user-contributed drivers  for  a\n  number of  other framestores and windowing packages (Sun gfx, Sun\n  console, Matrox VIP-1024, ITI IP-512, Lexidata,  Macintosh II, X\n  windowing system, and Iris).  The Hipsaddon package includes an\n  interface  for the  CRS-4000. It  is  a  simple matter to interface HIPS\n  with other frame- stores, and we can put interested users in touch with\n  users who  have interfaced HIPS with the Arlunya and Datacube Max-\n  Video. HIPS can be easily adapted for other  image  display devices\n  because 98% of HIPS is machine independent.\n\n  Availability\n\n  HIPS has proven itself a highly flexible  system,  both as  an\n  interactive  research tool, and for more production- oriented tasks. It\n  is both easy to use, and quickly adapted and extended to new uses. HIPS\n  is supplied on magnetic tape in UNIX tar format (either reel- to-reel or\n  Sun  cartridge), and comes with source code, libraries, a library of\n  convolu- tion masks, and on-line documentation and manual pages.\n\n  Michael Landy SharpImage Software P.O.

These are altogether different beasts! - nfotis ]\n\n  MIRA stands for Microcomputer Image Reduction and Analysis.  MIRA gives\n  workstation level performance on 386/486 DOS computers using SVGA cards in\n  256 color modes up to 1024x768. MIRA contains a very handsome/functional\n  GUI which is mouse and keystroke operated. MIRA reads/writes TIFF and FITS\n  formats, native formats of a number of CCD cameras, and uncompressed binary\n  images in byte, short integer, and 4-byte real pixel format in 1- or 2-\n  dimensions. The result of an image processing operation can be short integer\n  or real pixels, or the same as that of the input image. MIRA does the\n  operation using short or floating point arithmetic to maintain the precision\n  and accuracy of the pixel format. Over 100 functions are hand-coded in\n  assembly language for maximum speed on the Intel hardware.  The entire\n  graphical interface is also written in assembly language to maximize\n  the speed of windowing operations.  Windows for 2-d image and 1-d image/data\n  display and analysis have dedicated cursors which read position and value\n  value in real time as you move the mouse.  There are also smooth, real time\n  contrast and brightness stretch and panning of a magnified portion of\n  the displayed image(s), all operated by the mouse. A wide selection of\n  grayscale, pseudocolor, and random palettes is provided, and other \n  palettes can be generated.\n\n\nSupported functions include such niceties as the following:\n\no  image & image: + - / * interpolation\no  image & constant: + - / *\no  unary operations: abs value, polynomial of pixel value, chs, 1/x, log,\n   byteswap, clip values at upper/lower limits, short->real or real->short.\no  combine images by mean, median, mode, or sum of pixel values, with or\n   without autoscaling to mean, median, or mode of an image section.\no  convolutions/filters: Laplacian, Sobel edge operator, directional gradient,\n   line, Gaussian, elliptical and rectangular equal weight filters, unsharp\n   masking, median filters, user defined filter kernel.

Here at Lewis and Clark College we have recently installed a Digital Film\nsystem (based on the Mac Quadra) that does non-linear, full digital editing.\n\nIf you're considering such a system, here are the pros and cons:\n\nFor the educational environment, this system is excellent.  We use it to\nproduce a variety of educational materials for disemination on our local\nnetwork.  Because this programming is going to be viewed on other Macs, the\nimage quality is not as important as the ability to directly export the\nvideo to the Net.\n\nWe also use it to produce orientiation and promotional video programs for\nuse by the Lewis & Clark community.  Since these programs are not meant for\ncommercial or broadcast use, image quality is not critical.\n\nThe Digital Film system, for those of you who are uninitiated, is an A/B roll\ndigitizing system on one $5000 JPEG compression card.  It was promoted as\nan inexpensive online editing system with SVHS quality.  SuperMac, the maker\nof the card, is trying to achieve this quality level, but as yet, has been\nunable to deliver.  Our system produces "near VHS" quality at 30 fields per\nsecond (640x480 overscan).  The card repeats every other field to get 60\nfields per second.  This results in a kind of Super 8 film look that some\nfind distracting.\n\nIf you can get past this problem, you'll find the Adobe Premier editing \nsoftware quite enjoyable with which to work.  It produces thousands of\ndifferent effects from crystalize filters to DVE transitions to color matting.\n\nBecause of its non-linear nature, editing is fast and easy.  If you've ever\nused (or seen used) an AVID or Montage system, you'll recognize the methodology\nand the user interface.\n\nThe total system with Quadra 950 (40Megs of RAM), 1 gig drive, 21" Apple mon-\nitor, Panasonic SVHS 1960 edit deck, audio gear (cassette, CD, EQ, mixer, etc),\nComposite monitor, Digital Film card will set you back about $20,000.\n\nFor you video cowboys and girls, this system will not output at a quality\nthat will satisfy most of your clients.  Even though you can perform more\neffects than a toasterhead can imagine, an Amiga based off-line based system\nwill look better.\n\nWe use both Macs and Amigas for our video work.  Each for what each does best!
Well, it's been a while since this was discussed so i take the liberty of\nreprinting (without permission, so sue me) Eric Haines reprint of the very\ninteresting discussion of this topic...\n\n                /Jonas\n\n                         O /         \ O\n------------------------- X snip snip X ------------------------------\n                         O \         / O\n\n"Give a man a fish, and he'll eat one day.\nGive a man a fishing rod, and he'll laze around fishing and never do anything."\n\nWith that in mind, I reprint (without permission, so sue me) relevant\ninformation posted some years ago on this very problem.  Note the early use of\nPostScript technology, predating many of this year's papers listed in the\nApril 1st SIGGRAPH Program Announcement posted here a few days ago.\n\n-- Eric\n\n\nIntersection Between a Line and a Polygon (UNDECIDABLE??),\n	by Dave Baraff, Tom Duff\n\n	From: deb@charisma.graphics.cornell.edu\n	Newsgroups: comp.graphics\n	Keywords: P, NP, Jordan curve separation, Ursyhon Metrization Theorem\n	Organization: Program of Computer Graphics\n\n\nI think that this is a very difficult problem.  To start with, lines and\npolygons are semi-algebraic sets which both contain uncountable number of\npoints.  Here are a few off-the-cuff ideas.\n\nFirst, we need to check if the line and the polygon are separated.  Now, the\nJordan curve separation theorem says that the polygon divides the plane into\nexactly two open (and thus non-compact) regions.  Thus, the line lies\ncompletely inside the polygon, the line lies completely outside the polygon,\nor possibly (but this will rarely happen) the line intersects the polyon.\n\nNow, the phrasing of this question says "if a line intersects a polygon", so\nthis is a decision problem.  One possibility (the decision model approach) is\nto reduce the question to some other (well known) problem Q, and then try to\nsolve Q.  An answer to Q gives an answer to the original decision problem.\n\nIn recent years, many geometric problems have been successfully modeled in a\nnew language called PostScript.  (See "PostScript Language", by Adobe Systems\nIncorporated, ISBN # 0-201-10179-3, co. 1985).\n\nSo, given a line L and a polygon P, we can write a PostScript program that\ndraws the line L and the polygon P, and then "outputs" the answer.  By\n"output", we mean the program executes a command called "showpage", which\nactually prints a page of paper containing the line and the polygon.  A quick\nexamination of the paper provides an answer to the reduced problem Q, and thus\nthe original problem.\n\nThere are two small problems with this approach. \n\n	(1) There is an infinite number of ways to encode L and P into the\n	reduced problem Q.  So, we will be forced to invoke the Axiom of\n	Choice (or equivalently, Zorn's Lemma).  But the use of the Axiom of\n	Choice is not regarded in a very serious light these days.\n\n	(2) More importantly, the question arises as to whether or not the\n	PostScript program Q will actually output a piece of paper; or in\n	other words, will it halt?\n\n	Now, PostScript is expressive enough to encode everything that a\n	Turing Machine might do; thus the halting problem (for PostScript) is\n	undecidable.  It is quite possible that the original problem will turn\n	out to be undecidable.\n\n\nI won't even begin to go into other difficulties, such as aliasing, finite\nprecision and running out of ink, paper or both.\n\nA couple of references might be:\n\n1. Principia Mathematica.  Newton, I.  Cambridge University Press, Cambridge,\n   England.  (Sorry, I don't have an ISBN# for this).\n\n2.

Dickens, C.\n\n--------\n\nFrom: td@alice.UUCP (Tom Duff)\nSummary: Overkill.\nOrganization: AT&T Bell Laboratories, Murray Hill NJ\n\nThe situation is not nearly as bleak as Baraff suggests (he should know\nbetter, he's hung around The Labs for long enough).  By the well known\nDobbin-Dullman reduction (see J. Dullman & D. Dobbin, J. Comp. Obfusc.\n37,ii:  pp. 33-947, lemma 17(a)) line-polygon intersection can be reduced to\nHamiltonian Circuit, without(!) the use of Grobner bases, so LPI (to coin an\nacronym) is probably only NP-complete.  Besides, Turing-completeness will no\nlonger be a problem once our Cray-3 is delivered, since it will be able to\ncomplete an infinite loop in 4 milliseconds (with scatter-gather.)\n\n--------\n\nFrom: deb@svax.cs.cornell.edu (David Baraff)\n\nWell, sure its no worse than NP-complete, but that's ONLY if you restrict\nyourself to the case where the line satisfies a Lipschitz condition on its\nsecond derivative.  (I think there's an '89 SIGGRAPH paper from Caltech that\ndeals with this).\n\n--

Hello,\n\n\n\n	I just bought a copy.  I can't disagree that it is a very good\nbook.  But unfortunately I was looking for the same graphics feature\ndescribed in this book but _NOT_ in 640x480x16 or 320x200x256 mode. It\nis easy to accomodate all the pixel "descriptor" (or color attributes)\nin those modes into A0000-AFFFFF, but not in 640x480x256(which is what\nI am interested in).  I haven't finish the book but I affraid the\nauthor didn't talk much about this mode(or other SVGA modes).  If\nanyone out there know any good book dealing with fast SVGA graphics\nmanupulation(scrolling, repainting, all other good stuff..) please\nsend me mail.  Programming guide to SVGA card is also welcome.\n\n	Thanks in advance.\n\n\n \n************************************************************************\n*                         Tiang   T.

I am scanning in a color image and it looks fine on the screen.  When I \nconverted it into PCX,BMP,GIF files so as to get it into MS Windows the colors\ngot much lighter.  For example the yellows became white.  Any ideas?
I am interested in any information on stereoscopic imaging on a sun\nworkstation.  For the most part, I need to know if there is any hardware\navailable to interface the system and whether the refresh rates are\nsufficient to produce quality image representations.  Any information\nabout the subject would be greatly appreciated.
Sorry I missed you Raymond, I was just out in Dahlgren last month...\n\nI'm the Virtual Reality market manager for Silicon Graphics, so perhaps I\ncan help a little.\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, while SGI systems were used to create the special effects\nfor both Terminator 2 and Lawnmower Man, those are film-quality computer\ngraphics, rendered in software and written to film a frame at a time.  Each\nframe of computer animation for those films took hours to render on\nhigh-end parallel processing computer systems. Thus, that level of graphics\nwould be difficult, if not impossible, to acheive in real time (30 frames\nper second).\n\n\n\n\nIt depends upon how serious you are and how advanced your application is.\nTrue immersive visualization (VR), requires the rendering of complex visual\ndatabases at anywhere from 20 to 60 newly rendered frames per second.  This\nis a similar requirement to that of traditional flight simulators for pilot\ntraining. If the frame rate is too low, the user notices the stepping of\nthe frames as they move their head rapidly around the scene, so the motion\nof the graphics is not smooth and contiguous.  Thus the graphics system\nmust be powerful enough to sustain high frame rates while rendering complex\ndata representations.\n\nAdditionally, the frame rate must be constant.  If the system renders 15\nframes per second at one point, then 60 frames per second the next (perhaps\ndue to the scene in the new viewing direction being simpler than what was\nvisible before), the user can get heavily distracted by the medium (the\ngraphics computer) rather than focusing on the data. To maintain a constant\nframe rate, the system must be able to run in real-time.  UNIX in general\ndoes not support real-time operation, but Silicon Graphics has modified the\nUNIX kernel for its multi-processor systems to be able to support real-time\noperation, bypassing the usual UNIX process priority-management schemes. \nUniprocessor systems running UNIX cannot fundamentally support real-time\noperation (not Sun SPARC10, not HP 700 Series systems, not IBM RS-6000, not\neven SGI's uniprocessor systems like Indigo or Crimson). Only our\nmultiprocessor Onyx and Challenge systems support real-time operation due\nto their Symmetric Multi-Processing (SMP) shared-memory architecture.\n\nFrom a graphics perspective, rendering complex virtual environments\nrequires advanced rendering techniques like texture mapping and real-time\nmulti-sample anti-aliasing.  Of all of the general purpose graphics systems\non the market today, only Crimson RealityEngine and Onyx RealityEngine2\nsystems fully support these capabilities. The anti-aliasing is particularly\nimportant, as the crawling jagged edges of aliased polygons is an\nunfortunate distraction when immersed in a virtual environment.\n\n\n\nYou can use the general purpose graphics libraries listed above to develop\nVR applications, but that is starting at a pretty low level. There are\noff-the- shelf software packages available to get you going much faster,\nbeing targeted directly at the VR application developer. Some of the most\npopular are (in no particular order):\n\n	- Division Inc.		    (Redwood City, CA) - dVS\n	- Sens8 Inc.

(Dallas, TX)       - VisionWorks, AudioWorks\n	- Silicon Graphics Inc.	    (Mountain View,CA) - IRIS Performer\n\nThere are some others, but not off the top of my head...\n\n	\n\nThere are too many to list here, but here is a smattering:\n\n	- Fake Space Labs	    (Menlo Park,CA)    - BOOM\n	- Virtual Technologies Inc.

I too would like a 3D graphics library!  How much do C libraries cost\nanyway?  Can you get the tools used by, say, RenderMan, and can you get\nthem at a reasonable cost?\n\nSorry that I don't have any answers, just questions...
Well, the temp file thing creates an obvious problem: it is impossible to use\ncview for viewing CD-ROM based picture collections. And it is the ONLY non-\nwindows viewer that works properly with my Cirrus-based 24 bit VGA.

Concerning the proposed newsgroup split, I personally am not in favor of\ndoing this.  I learn an awful lot about all aspects of graphics by reading\nthis group, from code to hardware to algorithms.  I just think making 5\ndifferent groups out of this is a wate, and will only result in a few posts\na week per group.  I kind of like the convenience of having one big forum\nfor discussing all aspects of graphics.  Anyone else feel this way?\nJust curious.
No, VGALIB?  Amazing..  I guess it was lost in all those subdirs :-)\nThanks for correcting me.  It doesn't sound very appealing though, only\n320x200?  I'm glad it wasn't something major I missed.

It helps to have some idea of the source of the distortion - or at least\na reasonable model of the class of distortion.  Below is a very short\ndescription of the process which we use; if you have further questions,\nfeel free to poke me via e-mail.\n\n================================================================\n*ASSUME: locally smooth distortion\n\n0) Compute the Delaunay Triangulation of your (x,y) points.  This\n   defines the set of neighbors for each point.  If your data are\n   not naturally convex, you may have very long edges on the convex hull.\n   Consider deleting these edges.\n\n1) Now, there are two goals:\n\n    a) move the DistortedData(x,y) to the Reference(x,y)\n    b) keep the Length(e) (as measured from the current (x,y)'s)\n       as close as possible to the DigitizedLength(e) (as measured \n       using the digitized (x,y)'s).\n\n2) For every point, compute a displacement based on a) and b).  For\n   example:\n\n    a) For (x,y) points for which you know the Reference(x,y), you\n       can move alpha0*(Reference(x,y) - Current(x,y)).   This will\n       slowly move the DistortedReference(x,y) towards the\n       Reference(x,y). \n    b) For all other points, examine the current length of each edge.\n       For each edge, compute a displacement which would make that edge\n       the correct length (where "correct" is the DigitizedLength). \n       Take the vector sum of these edge displacements, and move the\n       point alpha1*SumOfEdgeDisplacements.  This will keep the\n       triangulated mesh consistent with your Digitized mesh.\n\n3) Iterate 2) until you are happy (for example, no point moves very much).\n\nalpha0 and alpha1 need to be determined by experimentation.   Consider\nhow much you believe the Reference(x,y) - i.e., do you absolutely insist\non the final points exactly matching the References, or do you want to\nbalance some error in matching the Reference against changes in length\nof the edges.\n\nWARNING: there are a couple of geometric invariants which must be\nobserved (essentially, you can't allow the convex hull to change, and\nyou can't allow triangles to "fold over" neighboring triangles.  Both of\nthese can be handled either by special case checks on the motion of\nindividual points, or by periodically re-triangulating the points (using \nthe current positions - but still calculating DigitizedLength from the\noriginal positions.  When we first did this, the triangulation time was\nprohibitive, so we only did it once.  If I were motivated to try and\nchange code that has been working in production mode for 5 years, I\n*might* go back and re-triangulate on every iteration.

Hi !\n\nIf you want to have Soft-Scrolling on your VGA, you have to change some \nintern registers of the CRTC. But it is a little bit difficult to explain, \nso I would suggest, you take a look at "The Programming of the \nEGA/VGA-Adapter" by Addison-Wesley. You will find all useful descriptions \nfor every available VGA-Register.\n\n-Boris

Sorry, Bryan, this is not quite correct. Remember the VGALIB package that comes\nwith Linux/SLS? It will switch to VGA 320x200x256 mode *without* Xwindows.\nSo at least it is *possible* to write a GIF viewer under Linux. However I don't\nthink that there exists a similar SVGA package, and viewing GIFs in 320x200 is\nnot very nice.\n\nBest Regards,\n\nArno\n\n-- \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nArno Schaefer				ENSIMAG, 2e Annee\nEmail: schaefer@silene.imag.fr\nTel.: (33) 76 51 79 95			:-)
hi all,\n\nIN SHORT: looking for very fast assembly code for line/circle drawing\n	  on SVGA graphics.\n\nCOMPLETE:\n	I am thinking of a simple but fast molecular\ngraphics program to write on PC or clones. (ball-and-stick type)\n\nReasons: programs that I've seen are far too slow for this purpose.\n\nPlatform: 386/486 class machine.\n	  800x600-16 or 1024x728-16 VGA graphics\n		(speed is important, 16-color for non-rendering\n		 purpose is enough; may stay at 800x600 for\n		 speed reason.)\n         (hope the code would be generic enough for different SVGA\n          cards.  My own card is based on Trident 8900c, not VESA?)\n\nWhat I'm looking for?\n1) fast, very fast routines to draw lines/circles/simple-shapes\n   on above-mentioned SVGA resolutions.\n   Presumably in assembly languagine.\n	Yes, VERY FAST please.\n2) related codes to help rotating/zooming/animating the drawings on screen.\n   Drawings for beginning, would be lines, circles mainly, think of\n   text, else later.\n   (you know, the way molecular graphics rotates, zooms a molecule)\n2) and any other codes (preferentially in C) that can help the \n   project.\n\nFinal remarks;-\nnon-profit.  expected to become share-, free-ware.\n\n	Any help is appreciated.\n	thanks\n\n-Frankie\nlau@tammy.harvard.edu

Hi everyone,\n\nI thought that some people may be interested in my VR\nsoftware on these groups:\n\n*******Announcing the release of Multiverse-1.0.2*******\n\nMultiverse is a multi-user, non-immersive, X-Windows based Virtual Reality\nsystem, primarily focused on entertainment/research.\n\nFeatures:\n\n   Client-Server based model, using Berkeley Sockets.\n   No limit to the number of users (apart from performance).\n   Generic clients.\n   Customizable servers.\n   Hierachical Objects (allowing attachment of cameras and light sources).\n   Multiple light sources (ambient, point and spot).\n   Objects can have extension code, to handle unique functionality, easily\n        attached.\n\nFunctionality:\n\n  Client:\n   The client is built around a 'fast' render loop. Basically it changes things\n   when told to by the server and then renders an image from the user's\n   viewpoint. It also provides the server with information about the user's\n   actions - which can then be communicated to other clients and therefore to\n   other users.\n\n   The client is designed to be generic - in other words you don't need to\n   develop a new client when you want to enter a new world. This means that\n   resources can be spent on enhancing the client software rather than adapting\n   it. The adaptations, as will be explained in a moment, occur in the servers.\n\n   This release of the client software supports the following functionality:\n\n    o Hierarchical Objects (with associated addressing)\n\n    o Multiple Light Sources and Types (Ambient, Point and Spot)\n\n    o User Interface Panels\n\n    o Colour Polygonal Rendering with Phong Shading (optional wireframe for\n	faster frame rates)\n\n    o Mouse and Keyboard Input\n\n   (Some people may be disappointed that this software doesn't support the\n   PowerGlove as an input device - this is not because it can't, but because\n   I don't have one! This will, however, be one of the first enhancements!)\n\n  Server(s):\n   This is where customization can take place. The following basic support is\n   provided in this release for potential world server developers:\n\n    o Transparent Client Management\n\n    o Client Message Handling\n\n   This may not sound like much, but it takes away the headache of\naccepting and\n   terminating clients and receiving messages from them - the\napplication writer\n   can work with the assumption that things are happening locally.\n\n   Things get more interesting in the object extension functionality. This is\n   what is provided to allow you to animate your objects:\n\n    o Server Selectable Extension Installation:\n        What this means is that you can decide which objects have extended\n        functionality in your world. Basically you call the extension\n        initialisers you want.\n\n    o Event Handler Registration:\n        When you develop extensions for an object you basically write callback\n        functions for the events that you want the object to respond to.\n        (Current events supported: INIT, MOVE, CHANGE, COLLIDE & TERMINATE)\n\n    o Collision Detection Registration:\n        If you want your object to respond to collision events just provide\n        some basic information to the collision detection management software.\n        Your callback will be activated when a collision occurs.\n\n    This software is kept separate from the worldServer applications because\n    the application developer wants to build a library of extended objects\n    from which to choose.\n\n    The following is all you need to make a World Server application:\n\n    o Provide an initWorld function:\n        This is where you choose what object extensions will be supported, plus\n        any initialization you want to do.\n\n    o Provide a positionObject function:\n        This is where you determine where to place a new client.\n\n    o Provide an installWorldObjects function:\n        This is where you load the world (.wld) file for a new client.\n\n    o Provide a getWorldType function:\n        This is where you tell a new client what persona they should have.\n\n    o Provide an animateWorld function:\n        This is where you can go wild! At a minimum you should let the objects\n        move (by calling a move function) and let the server sleep for a bit\n        (to avoid outrunning the clients).\n\n    That's all there is to it! And to prove it here are the line counts for the\n    three world servers I've provided:\n\n        generic - 81 lines\n        dactyl - 270 lines (more complicated collision detection due to the\n                           stairs! Will probably be improved with future\n                           versions)\n        dogfight - 72 lines\n\nLocation:\n\n   This software is located at the following site:\n   ftp.u.washington.edu\n\n   Directory:\n   pub/virtual-worlds\n\n   File:\n   multiverse-1.0.2.tar.Z\n\nFutures:\n\n   Client:\n\n    o Texture mapping.\n\n    o More realistic rendering: i.e. Z-Buffering (or similar), Gouraud shading\n\n    o HMD support.\n\n    o Etc, etc....\n\n   Server:\n\n    o Physical Modelling (gravity, friction etc).\n\n    o Enhanced Object Management/Interaction\n\n    o Etc, etc....\n\n   Both:\n\n    o Improved Comms!!!\n\nI hope this provides people with a good understanding of the Multiverse\nsoftware,\nunfortunately it comes with practically zero documentation, and I'm not sure\nwhether that will ever be able to be rectified! :-(\n\nI hope people enjoy this software and that it is useful in our explorations of\nthe Virtual Universe - I've certainly found fascinating developing it, and I\nwould *LOVE* to add support for the PowerGlove...and an HMD :-)!!\n\nFinally one major disclaimer:\n\nThis is totally amateur code. By that I mean there is no support for this code\nother than what I, out the kindness of my heart, or you, out of pure\ndesperation, provide. I cannot be held responsible for anything good or bad\nthat may happen through the use of this code - USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK!\n\nDisclaimer over!\n\nOf course if you love it, I would like to here from you. And anyone with\nPOSITIVE contributions/criticisms is also encouraged to contact me. Anyone who\nhates it: > /dev/null!\n\n************************************************************************\n*********\nAnd if anyone wants to let me do this for a living: you know where to\nwrite :-)!\n************************************************************************\n*********\n\nThanks,\n\nRobert.
That's a typical claim, though they say they've improved\ncompression speed considerably.  Did you find out anything else\nabout the book?  I'd be interested in looking at it if you could give me\nany pointers.\n\nReportedly, early fractal compression times of 24-100 hours used\nthat marvelous piece of hardware called "grad students" to do the\nwork.  Supposedly it's been automated since about 1988, but I'm still\nwaiting to be impressed.
I'm using "rayshade" on the u.w. computers here, and i'd like input\nfrom other users, and perhaps swap some ideas.  I could post\nuuencoded .gifs here, or .ray code, if anyone's interested.

That is in fact the current version (it only came out in December).\n\n\nMy test movie was created at 320*240 resolution, it wasn't being scaled up.\nScaling was a very CPU-intensive operation with the original QuickTime (1.0);\nthe current version has optimizations for ratios like 4:1 (160*120 -> 320*240),\nbut even so, I'm prepared to believe that the performance isn't as good as\nwith playing back an actual 320*240 movie. I haven't done any numerical\nmeasurements for scaled playback.

Hi,\n\n	I have a problem, I hope some of the 'gurus' can help me solve.\n\n	Background of the problem:\n	I have a rectangular mesh in the uv domain, i.e  the mesh is a \n	mapping of a 3d Bezier patch into 2d. The area in this domain\n	which is inside a trimming loop had to be rendered. The trimming\n	loop is a set of 2d Bezier curve segments.\n	For the sake of notation: the mesh is made up of cells.\n\n	My problem is this :\n	The trimming area has to be split up into individual smaller\n	cells bounded by the trimming curve segments. If a cell\n	is wholly inside the area...then it is output as a whole ,\n	else it is trivially rejected. \n\n	Does any body know how thiss can be done, or is there any algo. \n	somewhere for doing this.\n\n	Any help would be appreciated.\n\n	Thanks, \n	Ani.
Boy, this will be embarassing if it is trivial or an FAQ:\n\nGiven 4 points (non coplanar), how does one find the sphere, that is,\ncenter and radius, exactly fitting those points?

Hi all!\n	I've just recently become seriously hooked on POV, but there are a few\nthing that I want to do that POV won't do (penumbral shadows, dispersion\netc.). I was just wondering: what other shareware/freeware raytracers are\nout there, and what can they do? I've heard of Vivid and Polyray and \nRayshade and so on, but I'd rather no wade through several hundred pages of \nmanual for each trying to work out what their capabilities are. Can anyone\nhelp? A comparison of tracing speed between each program would also be \nmucho useful.\n											Mark.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMark Mackey                 | Life is a terminal disease and oxygen is         \nmmackey@aqueous.ml.csiro.au | addictive.

It's not a bad question: I don't have any refs that list this algorithm\neither. But thinking about it a bit, it shouldn't be too hard.\n\n1) Take three of the points and find the plane they define as well as\nthe circle that they lie on (you say you have this algorithm already)\n\n2) Find the center  of this circle. The line passing through this center\nperpendicular to the plane of the three points passes through the center of\nthe sphere.\n\n3) Repeat with the unused point and two of the original points. This\ngives you two different lines that both pass through the sphere's\norigin. Their interection is the center of the sphere.\n\n4) the radius is easy to compute, it's just the distance from the center to\nany of the original points.\n\nI'll leave the math to you, but this is a workable algorithm. :-)\n\n\nAn alternate method would be to take pairs of points: the plane formed\nby the perpendicular bisector of each line segment pair also contains the\ncenter of the sphere. Three pairs will form three planes, intersecting\nat a point. This might be easier to implement.
Why didn't you create 8 grey-level images, and display them for\n1,2,4,8,16,32,64,128... time slices?\n\nThis requires the same total exposure time, and the same precision in\ntiming, but drastically reduces the image-preparation time, no?
Hi!  I am in immediate need for details of various graphics compression\ntechniques.

It's really not that hard to do.  There are books out there which explain\neverything, and the basic 3D functions, translation, rotation, shading, and\nhidden line removal are pretty easy.  I wrote a program in a few weeks witht\nhe help of a book, and would be happy to give you my source.\n	Also, Quickdraw has a lot of 3D functions built in, and Think pascal\ncan access them, and I would expect that THINK C could as well.  If you can\nfind out how to use the Quickdraw graphics library, it would be an excellent\nchoice, since it has a lot of stuff, and is built into the Mac, so should be\nfast.\n\nLibertarian, atheist, semi-anarchal Techno-Rat.
Let's say you have a scanned image of a line drawing; in this case a\nboat, but it could be anything.  On the drawing you have a set of\nreference points whose true x,y positions are known.  \n\nNow you digitize the drawing manually (in this case, using Yaron\nDanon's excellent Digitize program).  That is, you use a program which\nconverts cursor positions to x,y and saves those values when you click\nthe mouse.\n\nUpon digitizing you notice that the reference point values that come\nout of the digitizing process differ in small but significant ways\nfrom the known true values.  This is understandable because the\nscanned drawing is a reproduction of the original and there are\nsuccessive sources of distortion such as differential expansion and\ncontraction of paper, errors introduced in the printing process,\nscanner errors and what have you.\n\nThe errors are not uniform over the entire drawing, so "global"\nadjustments such as stretching/contracting uniformly over x or y, or\nrotating the whole drawing, are not satisfactory.\n\nSo the question is: does any kind soul know of an algorithm for\nremoving such distortion?  In particular, if I have three sets of\npoints \n\nReference(x,y) (the known true values)\n\nDistortedReference(x,y) (the same points, with known errors)\n\nDistortedData(x,y) (other points, with unknown errors)\n\nwhat function of Reference and Distorted could I apply to\nDistortedData to remove the errors.\n\nI suspect the problem could be solved by treating the distorted\nreference points as resulting from the projection of a "bumpy" 3d\nsurface, solving for the surface and then "flattening" it to remove\nthe errors in the other data points.\n\nAny kind and informed soul out there have any ideas, or better yet,\npointers to treatments of the same or similar problems?\n\nThanks,
Some rendering programs require that all surface normals point in the same\ndirection.  (ie: On a closed cube, all normals point outwards).  You can use\nthe points on the faces to determine the direction of the normal, by making\nsure that all points are either in clockwise or counter-clockwise order.\n\nHow do you go about orienting all normals in the same direction, given a \nset of points, edges and faces?   Say that you had a cube with all faces that \nhave their normals facing outwards, except for one face.  What's the\nbest way to realize that face is "flipped", and should have it's points\nre-ordered?   I thought I had a good way of telling this, but then realized\nthat the algorithm I had would only tell you if you had points in clockwise\norder for a 2d polygon.  I'd like something for 3d data.\n\nAny hints, tips, references would be appreciated.\n\nSteve

I certainly do use it whenever I have to do TIFF, and it usually works\nvery well.  That's not my point.  I'm >philosophically< opposed to it\nbecause of its complexity.\n\nThis complexity has led to some programs' poor TIFF writers making\nsome very bizarre files, other programs' inability to load TIFF\nimages (though they'll save them, of course), and a general\ninability to interchange images between different environments\ndespite the fact they all think they understand TIFF.\n\nAs the saying goes, "It's not me I'm worried about- it's all the\nabuse of TIFF over the years, and I chalk it all up to the immense (and\nunnecessary) complexity of the format.\n\nIn the words of the TIFF 5.0 spec, Appendix G, page G-1 (capitalized\nemphasis mine):\n\n"The only problem with this sort of success is that TIFF was designed\nto be powerful and flexible, at the expense of simplicity.  It takes a\nfair amount of effort to handle all the options currently defined in\nthis specification (PROBABLY NO APPLICATION DOES A COMPLETE JOB),\nand that is currently the only way you can be >sure< that you will be\nable to import any TIFF image, since there are so many\nimage-generating applications out there now."\n\n\nIf a program (or worse all applications) can't read >every< TIFF\nimage, that means there are some it won't- some that I might have to\ndeal with.  Why would I want my images to be trapped in that format?  I\ndon't and neither should anyone who agrees with my reasoning- not\nthat anyone does, of course! :-)

I need information on the Display PostScript strokeadjust feature.\nThis feature adjusts the endpoints of lines so that the displayed line\nlooks better on low resolution devices.\n\nThe PostScript literature explains the process to some extent.  They\nalso give an example of how to "emulate" strokeadjust in PostScript\nenvironments where it is absent.\n\nThe suggested emulation is to modify the coordinates of the endpoints\nof a line using the following formula for each coordinate:\n\n	new_coord = (round (old_coord - 0.25)) + 0.25\n	\nDoing this we end up with all coordinates ending in ".25".  From\nreading I thought that what they might actually do is:\n\n	new_coord = ((trunc (old_coord * 2)) / 2) + 0.25\n	\nThis results in all the coordinates ending in either "0.25" or "0.75" \nwhichever is closer.\n\nBy doing some actual comparisons with Display PostScript, I find that\nneither of these is what DPS really uses.  Since I like how the DPS\nresult looks better than how my stuff looks, I'd like to know if\nanyone who knows how DPS does it is willing/able to tell me.\n\nThanks,
Hi again,\n\nMany thanks to all the people who responded to my request for a MS-\nWindows screen grabber.  It proves to me AGAIN that the net is a \nwonderful thing.  :-)\n\nSo, in summary:\n\nThere are two choices:\n\n1)	Various screen grabber packages (Corel Draw has one, there are\na couple on simtel and cica).\n\n2)	Use the built-in PrintScreen and Alt-PrintScreen functionality\nto paste the screen (or window) to the clipboard.  Then paste the \nclipboard to your application.  Cool!\n\nAgain, thanks for the info...\n\nGrant (the MS-Windows newbie -- Unix and X are my bag ;-)
I've just had the good fortune to be hired by Electronic Arts as Senior\nComputer Graphics Artist at the Vancouver, Canada office.  :^)\n\nThe timing has a lot to do with the 3DO which EA is putting a lot of resources\ninto.

For some reason I never saw the original post on this thread, but if you are\nlooking for fast polygon routines on vga on a PC, you really can't go past\nthe mode X stuff from Dr Dobbs. This code is all p.domain (as far as I know),\nand in the original articles, the routines were all presented as dumb vga\nroutines, and then optimised to modeX with some interesting discussion along\nthe way.\nIf you are interested, I could find out more details of the issues in question,\n(I have them at home).

The Harvard Computer Society is pleased to announce its third lecture of\nthe spring.  Ivan Sutherland, the father of computer graphics and an\ninnovator in microprocessing, will be speaking at Harvard University on\nTuesday, April 20, 1993, at 4:00 pm in Aiken Computations building, room\n101.  The title of his talk is "Logical Effort and the Conflict over the\nControl of Information."\n\nCookies and tea will be served at 3:30 pm in the Aiken Lobby.  Admissions\nis free, and all are welcome.\n\nAiken is located north of the Science Center near the Law School.\n\nFor more information, send e-mail to eekim@husc.harvard.edu.\n\nThe lecture will be videotaped, and a tape will be made available.\n\nThanks.

The gl2p1.lzh stuff under gfx/show on the Aminet sites includes a\n    utility called pic2hl, that is a filter for HamLab that can handle\n    the most commonly used kinds of .PIC and .CLP files.\n\n    The biggest problem is that the .CLP files don't usually contain a\n    palette, so you need to convert a .PIC with the right palette\n    first (which creates a "ram:picpal" file), and then convert the\n    .CLP files.
AT&T also puts out two new products for windows, Model numbers elude me now,\na 15 bit video board with framegrabber and a 16bit with same. Yesterday I\nwas looking at a product at a local Software ETC store. Media Vision makes\na 15bit (32,768 color) frame capture board that is stand alone and doesnot\nuse the feature connector on your existing video card. It claims upto 30 fps\nlive capture as well as single frame from either composite NTSC or s-video\nin and out.

I was chaining around in the anonymous ftp world looking for 3D Studio\nmeshes and other interesting graphical stuff for the program, and found\na few files with the extension 3D2.  My 3DS v2.01 doesn't know this type\nof file, so what are they?\n\nAnd of course, the perennial... Where are some meshes, fli files, etc.\nout there?   I would have thought that someone would have collected a few\nand put them somewhere, but alas I am without this knowledge.\n\nmucho appreciato
Yes, I want to concentrate on other development issues - I've created graphics\n libraries before, it's too time consuming... life's too short!\n\n\n Thanks for the clarification... Before posting my original request I had looked\n into the Mac's 3D capabilities and dismissed them as low grade.
Does anybody know if there are any good 2d-graphics packages\n	available for IBM RS/6000 & AIX ? I'm looking for something\n	like DEC's GKS or Hewlett-Packards Starbase, both of which\n	have reasonably good support for different output devices\n	like plotters, terminals, X etc.\n\n	I have tried also xgks from X11 distribution and IBM's implementation\n	of Phigs. Both of them work but we require more output devices\n	than just X-windows.\n\n	Our salesman at IBM was not very familiar with graphics and\n	I am not expecting for any good solutions from there.\n\n\n		Ari\n\n---

Rather than decide which book you want to buy, you need to decide which\nprogramming interface you want to use, then buy the appropriate book.\n\nI wrote an article for the X Resource which discusses the differences\nbetween PHIGS and PEXlib (it will appear in Issue 6 which should be out\npretty soon).  But here's a brief summary...\n\nPHIGS is a graphics API which was designed to be portable to many\ndevices.  Most implementations support the X Window System and take\nadvantage of a 3D extension to X called "PEX".  PEXlib is a slightly\n"lower" level API which was designed to efficiently support the PEX\nextension to X.\n\nSome advantages of using PEXlib...\n- Integrates with Xlib,Xt,Motif,etc. better than PHIGS\n- Provides immediate mode capabilities\n- Is free of "policy"\n- PEX supports PHIGS, but is currently being extended to support\n  features not found in PHIGS (like texture mapping, anti-aliasing).\n  PEXlib will give you access to all of these features.\n\nSome advantages of using PHIGS...\n- Support for multiple devices, not just X based ones\n- Support for archiving, metafiles, hardcopy output\n- PHIGS has predefined input devices to make input easier\n- PHIGS can handle exposure events and resizing for you\n- PHIGS can help you with colormap selection/creation.\n\nIf you're working strictly in X and don't care about things like\narchiving, I would go with PEXlib.  Either way, you will find that\nboth API's have a lot in common.
Hi,\n\nI've noticed that if you only save a model (with all your mapping planes\npositioned carefully) to a .3DS file that when you reload it after restarting\n3DS, they are given a default position and orientation.  But if you save\nto a .PRJ file their positions/orientation are preserved.  Does anyone\nknow why this information is not stored in the .3DS file?  Nothing is\nexplicitly said in the manual about saving texture rules in the .PRJ file. \nI'd like to be able to read the texture rule information, does anyone have \nthe format for the .PRJ file?\n\nIs the .CEL file format available from somewhere?\n\nRych
The RS6000 compiler is so forgiving, I think that if you mixed COBOL & pascal\nthe C compiler still wouldn't complain. :-)\n\nSteve\n--
You probably need an X server running on top of MS DOS.  I use Desqview/X\nbut any MS-DOS X server should do.\n\n--
I recently got a file describing a library of rendering routines \ncalled SIPP (SImple Polygon Processor).  Could anyone tell me where I can \nFTP the source code and which is the newest version around?\n        Also, I've never used Renderman so I was wondering if Renderman \nis like SIPP?  ie. a library of rendering routines which one uses to make \na program that creates the image...\n\n                                        Thanks,  Joe Tham

Maybe I should point out that we are not talking about c.s.amiga.*.\nOnly comp.graphics.
I plan to post a summary of responses to this as soon as I have working\ncode, which I will also include.  The intersection of 3 planes method\nlooks best, but my implementation based on a short article in \nGraphics Gems I doesn't work.  I may be misinterpreting, of course.\n\nI had avoided the simultaneous solution of the plane equations in favor\nof dot and cross products, but the former may actually be better.  In either\ncase a matrix determinant needs to be computed (implicitly in the solution\nof linear equations).\n\nTo get the planes, I was taking the midpoint of the line from, say,\nP1 to P2, and setting the normal as the "normalized" vector from P1 to P2.\nThese just plugged into the formula in Graphics Gems.  HOwever, the resulting\ncenter point is only occasionally equidistant from all 4 of my test points\n(for different tests).  My matrix/vector math is very rusty, but it looks like\nI need to verify the formula, or use the simultaneous equation solution, which\nwill require bringing in another routine I don't have (but should be easy to\nfind).\n\nAnother method is to first find the center of the circle defined by 2 sets\nof 3 points, and intersecting the normals from there.  This would also define\nthe circle center.  However, small numerical imprecisions would make the\nlines not intersect.  Supposedly 3 planes HAVE to intersect in a unique\npoint if they are not parallel.\n\nEd\n\nThanks to all who answered so far.

The OFF data is triangles at\na specific resolution (around 8x8[x4 triangles] meshing per patch).\nThe SPD package provides the spline patch descriptions and performs a\ntessellation at any specified resolution.\n\nb. Space Shuttle ?\n------------------\n\nTolis Lerios <tolis@nova.stanford.edu> has built a list of Space Shuttle\ndatafiles. Here's a summary (From his sci.space list):\n\nmodel1:\nA modified version of the newsgroup model (model2)\n\n406 vertices (296 useful, i.e. referred to in the polygon descriptions.)\n389 polygons (233 3-vertex, 146 4-vertex, 7 5-vertex, 3 6-vertex).\nPayload doors non-existent.\nUnits: unknown.\n\nSimon Marshall (S.Marshall@sequent.cc.hull.ac.uk) has a copy. He\nsaid there is no proprietary information associated with it.\n\nmodel2:\nThe newsgroup model, in OFF format. You can find it in\n\ngondwana.ecr.mu.oz.au , file pub/off/objects/shuttle.geo\nhanauma.stanford.edu ,  /pub/graphics/Comp.graphics/objects/shuttle.data\n\nmodel3:\nThe triangles' model.\n\nThis model is stored in several files, each defining portions of the model.\n\nGreg Henderson (henders@infonode.ingr.com) has a copy.  He did\nnot mention any restriction on the model's distribution.\n\nmodel4:\nThe NASA model.\n\nThe file starts off with a header line containing three real numbers,\ndefining the offsets used by Lockheed in their simulations:\n\n<x offset> <y offset> <z offset>\n\nFrom then on, the file consists of a sequence of polygon descriptions\n\n3473 vertices.\n2748 polygons (407 3-vertex, 2268 4-vertex, 33 5-vertex, 14 6-vertex,\n 10 7-vertex, 8 8-vertex, 8 12-vertex, 2 13-vertex, 2 15-vertex,\n 17 16-vertex, 2 17-vertex, 2 18-vertex, 3 19-vertex, 8 24-vertex).\nPayload doors closed.\nUnits: inches.\n\nJon Berndt (jon@l14h11.jsc.nasa.gov) seems to be responsible for the model\nProprietary info: unknown\n\nmodel5:\nThe old shuttle model.\n\nThe file consists of a sequence of polygon descriptions.\n\n104 vertices.\n452 polygons (11 3-vertex, 41 4-vertex).\nPayload doors open.\nUnits: meters.\n\nWe have been using this model at STAR Labs, Stanford University, for\nsome years now. Contact me (tolis@nova.stanford.edu) or my supervisor\nScott Williams (scott@star5.stanford.edu) if you want a copy.\n\n========================================================================\n\n16. Image annotation software\n=============================\n\na. Touchup runs in Sunview and is pretty good.  It reads in\n  rasterfiles, but even if your image isn't normally stored\n  in rasterfile format you could use screendump to make it a\n  rasterfile.\n\nb. Idraw (part of Stanford's InterViews distribution) can handle some\n  image formats in addition to being a MacDraw like tool.  I'm not\n  sure exactly what they are.\n  You can ftp the idraw's binary from interviews.stanford.edu.\n\nc. Tgif is another MacDraw like tool that can handle X11 bitmap (xbm)\n  and X11 pixmap (xpm) formats.  If the image you have is in formats\n  other than xbm or xpm, you can get the pbmplus toolkit to convert\n  things like gif or even some Macintosh formats to xpm.\n  Tgif's sources are available in the pub directory on cs.ucla.edu\n  (Version 2.12 of tgif at patchlevel 7 plus patch8 and patch9)\n\nd. Use the editimage facility of KHOROS (see below).\n  This is just one utility in the overall system- you can essentially do all\n  your image processing and macdraw-type graphics using this package.\n\ne. You might be able to get by with PBMPlus.  pbmtext gives you text output\n  bitmaps which can be overlaid on top of your image.\n\nf. 'ice' requires Sun hardware running OpenWindows 3.It's a PostScript-based\n  graphical editor,and it's available for anonymous ftp from Internet host\n  eo.soest.hawaii.edu (128.171.151.12). Requires Sun C++ 2.0 and\n  two other locally developed packages, the LXT library (an Xlib-based\n  toolkit) and a small C++ class library. All files (pub/ice.tar.Z,\n  pub/lxt.tar.Z and pub/ldgoc++.tar.Z) are available in compressed\n  tar format. pub/ice.tar.Z contains a README that gives installation\n  instructions, as well as an extensive man page (ice.1).\n  A statically-linked compressed executable pub/ice-sun4.Z for\n  SPARC systems is also available for ftp.\n\n  All software is the property of Columbia University and may not\n  be redistributed without permission.\n\n  ice means Image Composition Environment and it's an imaging tool that\n  allows raster images to be combined with a wide variety of\n  PostScript annotations in WYSIWYG fashion via X11 imaging\n  routines and NeWS PostScript rasterizing.\n\ng. Use ImageMagick to annotate an image from your X server.  Pick the \n  position of your text with the cursor and choose your font and pen \n  color from a pull-down menu.

This was\n  developed at the University of Colorado (Boulder) by some people working\n  for Alex Goetz.  You might try contacting them if you already have IDL\n  or would be willing to buy it.  It's a few thousand dollars (American) I\n  expect for IDL and the other should be free.  Those are the general\n  purpose packages I've heard of, besides what TerraMar has.\n  SIPS _was_ written for AVIRIS imagery.  I'm not sure how general purpose\n  it is.  You would have to contact Goetz or one of his people and ask.  I\n  have another piece of software (PCW) that does PC and Walsh\n  transformations with pseudocoloring and clustering and limited image\n  modification (you can compute an image using selected components).  I've\n  used it on 70 megabyte AVIRIS images without problems, but for the best\n  speed you need an external DSP card.  It will work without it, but large\n  images take quite a while (50-70 times as long) to process.  That's a\n  freebie if you want it"\n\n  "My  favorite is IDL (Interactive Data Language) from Research Systems,\n  Inc.  IDL is in my opinion, much better and infinitely easier. Its\n  programming language is very strong and easy -- very Pascal-like. It\n  handles the number-crunching very well, also. Personally, I like doing\n  the number-crunching with IDL on the VAX (or Mathematica, Igor, or even\n  Excel on the Mac if it's not too hairy), then bringing it over to NIH\n  Image for the imaging part. I have yet to encounter any situation which\n  that combination couldn't handle, and the speed and ease of use\n  (compared to IRAF) was incredible. By the way, it's mostly astronomical\n  image processing which I've been doing. This means image enhancement,\n  cleaning up bad lines/pixels, and some other traditional image\n  processing routines. Then, for example, taking a graph of intensity\n  versus position along a line I choose with the mouse, then doing a curve\n  fit to that line (which I might do like in KaleidaGraph.)

GIS (Geographical Information Systems software)\n===================================================\n\nGRASS\n-----\n  (Geographic Resource Analysis Support System) of the US Army\n  Construction Engineering Research Lab (CERL). It is a popular geographic and\n  remote sensing image processing package. Many may think of GRASS as a\n  Geographic Information System rather than an Image Processing package,\n  although it is reported to have significant image processing\n  capabilities.\n\n  Feature Descriptions\n\n  I use GRASS  because it's public domain and can be obtained through the\n  internet for free.  GRASS runs in Unix and is written in C.  The source\n  code can be obtained through an anonymous ftp from the Office of Grass\n  Integration.  You then compile the source code for your machine, using\n  scripts provided with GRASS.  I would recommend GRASS for someone who\n  already has a workstation and is on a limited budget. GRASS is not very\n  user-friendly, compared to Macintosh software." A first review  of\n  overview documentation indicates that it looks useful and has some pixel\n  resampling functions not in other packages plus good general purpose\n  image enhancement routines (fft). Kelly Maurice at Vexcel Corp. in\n  Boulder, CO is a primary user of GRASS .  This gentleman has used the\n  GRASS software and developed multi-spectral (238 bands ??) volumetric\n  rendering, full color, on Suns and Stardents. It was a really effective\n  interface.  Vexcel Corp. currently has a contract to map part of Venus\n  and convert the Magellan radar data into contour maps. You can call them\n  at (303) 444-0094 or email care of greg@vexcel.com 192.92.90.68\n\n  Host Configuration Requirements\n\n  If you are willing to run A/UX you could install GRASS   on a Macintosh\n  which has significant image analysis and import capabilities for\n  satellite data. GRASS  is public-domain, and can run on a high-end PC\n  under UNIX. It is raster-based, has some image-processing capability,\n  and can display vector data (but analysis must be done in the raster\n  environment). I have used GRASS V.3 on a SUN workstation and found it\n  easy to use. It is best, of course, for data that are well represented\n  in raster (grid-cell) form.\n\n  Availability\n\n  CERL's Office of Grass Integration (OGI)  maintains an ftp server:\n  moon.cecer.army.mil (129.229.20.254).\n\n  Mail regarding this site should be addressed to\n  grass-ftp-admin@moon.cecer.army.mil.\n\n  This location will be the new "canonical" source for GRASS software, as\n  well as bug fixes, contributed sources, documentation, and other files.\n  This FTP server also supports dynamic compression and uncompression and\n  "tar" archiving of files.  A feature attraction of the server is John\n  Parks' GRASS tutorial.  Because the manual is still in beta-test stage,\n  John requests that people only acquire it if they are willing to review\n  it and mail him comments/corrections. The OGI is not currently\n  maintaining this document, so all correspondence about it should be\n  directed to grassx@tang.uark.edu\n\n  Support\n\n  Listserv mailing lists:\n\n  grassu-list@amber.cecer.army.mil (for GRASS users; application-level\n  questions, support concerns, miscellaneous questions, etc) Send\n  subscribe commands to grassu-request@amber.cecer.army.mil.\n\n  grassp-list@amber.cecer.army.mil (for GRASS programmers; system-level\n  questions and tips, tricks, and techniques of design and implementation\n  of GRASS applications) Send subscribe commands to\n  grassp-request@amber.cecer.army.mil.\n\n  Both lists are maintained by the Office of Grass Integration (subset of\n  the Army Corps of Engineers Construction Engineering Research Lab in\n  Champaign, IL). The OGI is providing the lists as a service to the\n  community; while OGI and CERL employees will participate in the lists,\n  we can make no claim as to content or veracity of messages that pass\n  through the list.  If you have questions, problems, or comments, send\n  E-mail to lists-owner@amber.cecer.army.mil and a human will respond.\n\nMicrostation Imager\n-------------------\n  Intergraph (based in Huntsville Alabama) sells a wide range of GIS\n  software/hardware. Microstation is a base  graphics package that Imager\n  sits on top of. Imager is basically an  image processing package with a\n  heavy GIS/remote sensing flavor.\n\n  Feature Description\n\n  Basic geometry manipulations: flip, mirror, rotate, generalized affine.\n  Rectification: Affine, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th order models as well as a\n  projective model (warp an image to a vector map or to another image).\n  RGB to IHS and IHS to RGB conversion.  Principal component analysis.\n  Classification: K-means and isodata.  Fourier Xforms: Forward, filtering\n  and reverse.  Filters: High pass, low pass, edge enhancing, median,\n  generic.  Complex Histogram/Contrast control.  Layer Controller: manages\n  up to 64 images at a time -- user can extract single bands from a 3 band\n  image or create color images by combining various individual bands, etc.\n\n  The package is designed for a remote sensing application (it can handle\n  VERY LARGE images) and there is all kinds of other software available\n  for GIS applications.\n  Host Configuration Requirements\n\n  It runs on Intergraph Workstations (a Unix machine similar to a Sun)\n  though there  were rumors (there are always rumors) that the software\n  would be  ported to PC and possibly a Sun environment.\n\nPCI\n---\n  A company called PCI, Inc., out of Richmond Hill, Ontario, Canada, makes\n  an array of software utilities for processing, manipulation, and use of\n  remote sensing data in eight or ten different "industry standard"\n  formats: LGSOWG, BSQ, LANDSAT, and a couple of others whose titles I\n  forget.  The software is available in versions for MS-DOS, Unix\n  workstations (among them HP, Sun, and IBM), and VMS, and quite possibly\n  other platforms by now.  I use the VMS version.\n\n  The "PCI software" consists of several classes/groups/packages of\n  utilities, grouped by function but all operating on a common "PCI\n  database" disk file.  The "Tape I/O" package is a set of utility\n  programs which read from the various remote-sensing industry tape\n  formats INTO, or write those formats out FROM, the "PCI database" file;\n  this is the only package I use or know much about.  Other packages can\n  display data from the PCI database to one or another of several\n  PCI-supported third-party color displays, output numeric or bitmap\n  representation of image data to an attached printer, e.g. an Epson-type\n  dot-matrix graphics printer.  You might be more spe- cifically\n  interested in the mathematical operations package: histo- gram and\n  Fourier analysis, equalization, user-specified operations (e.g.\n  "multiply channel 1 by 3, add channel 2, and store as channel 5"), and\n  God only knows what all else -- there's a LOT.  I don't have and don't\n  use these, so can't say much about them; you only buy the packages your\n  particular application/interest calls for.\n\n  Each utility is controlled by from one to eight "parameters," read from\n  a common "parameter file" which must be (in VMS anyway) in your "default\n  directory."  Some utilities will share parameters and use the same\n  parameter for a different purpose, so it can get a bit confusing setting\n  up a series of operations.  The standard PCI environment contains a\n  scripting language very similar to IBM-PC BASIC, but which allows you to\n  automate the process of setting up parameters for a common, complicated,\n  lengthy or difficult series of utility executions.  (In VMS I can also\n  invoke utilities independently from a DCL command procedure.)  There's\n  also an optional programming library which allows you to write compiled\n  language programs which can interface with (read from/write to) the PCI\n  data structures (database file, parameter file).\n\n  The PCI software is designed specifically for remote-sensing images, but\n  requires such a level of operator expertise that, once you reach the\n  level where you can handle r-s images, you can figure out ways to handle\n  a few other things as well.  For instance, the Tape I/O package offers a\n  utility for reading headerless multi-band (what Adobe PhotoShop on the\n  Macintosh calls "raw") data from tape, in a number of different\n  "interleave" orders. This turns out to be ideal for manipulating the\n  graphic-arts industry's "CT2T" format, would probably (I haven't tried)\n  handle Targa, and so on. Above all, however, you HAVE TO KNOW WHAT\n  YOU'RE DOING or you can screw up to the Nth degree and have to start\n  over.  It's worth noting that the PCI "database" file is designed to\n  contain not only "raster" (image) data, but vectors (for overlaying map\n  information entered via digitizing table), land-use, and all manner of\n  other information (I observe that a remote-sensing image tape often\n  contains all manner of information about the spectral bands, latitude,\n  longitude, time, date, etc. of the original satellite pass; all of this\n  can go into the PCI "database").\n\n  I _believe_ that on workstations the built-in display is used.  On VAX\n  systems OTHER than workstations PCI supports only a couple of specific\n  third-party display systems (the name Gould/Deanza seems to come to\n  mind).  One of MY personal workarounds was a display program which would\n  display directly from a PCI "database" file to a Peritek VCT-Q (Q-bus\n  24-bit DirectColor) display subsystem.  PCI software COULD be "overkill"\n  in your case; it seems designed for the very "high end"\n  applications/users, i.e. those for whom a Mac/PC largely doesn't suffice\n  (although as you know the gap is getting smaller all the time).  It's\n  probably no coincidence that PCI is located in Canada, a country which\n  does a LOT of its land/resource management via remote sensing; I believe\n  the Canadian government uses PCI software for some of its work in these\n  areas.\n\nSPAM (Spectral Analysis Manager)\n--------------------------------\n  Back in 1985 JPL developed something called SPAM (Spectral Analysis\n  Manager) which got a fair amount of use at the time.  That was designed\n  for Airborne Imaging Spectrometer imagery (byte data, <= 256 pixels\n  across by <= 512 lines by <= 256 bands); a modified version has since\n  been developed for AVIRIS (Airborne VIsual and InfraRed Imaging\n  Spectrometer) which uses much larger images.\n\n  Spam does none of these things (rectification, classification, PC and\n  IHS transformations, filtering, contrast enhancement, overlays).\n  Actually, it does limited filtering and contrast enhancement\n  (stretching).  Spam is aimed at spectral identification and clustering.\n\n  The original Spam uses X or SunView to display.  The AVIRIS version may\n  require VICAR, an executive based on TAE, and may also require a frame\n  buffer.  I can refer you to people if you're interested.  PCW requires X\n  for display.\n\nMAP II\n------\n  Among the Mac GIS systems, MAP II is distributed by John Wiley.\n\nCLRview\n-------\n  CLRview is a 3-dimensional visualization program designed to exploit\n  the real-time capabilities of Silicon Graphics IRIS computers.\n\n  This program is designed to provide a core set of tools to aid in the\n  visualization of information from CAD and GIS sources.  It supports\n  the integration of many common but disperate data sources such as DXF,\n  TIN, DEM, Lattices, and Arc/Info Coverages among others.\n\n  CLRview can be obtained from explorer.dgp.utoronto.ca (128.100.1.129) \n  in the directory pub/sgi/clrview.\n\n  Contact:\n  Rodney Hoinkes\n  Head of Design Applications\n  Centre for Landscape Research\n  University of Toronto\n  Tel:   (416) 978-7197\n  Email: rodney@dgp.utoronto.ca\n\n==========================================================================\n\nEnd of Resource Listing

Does anyone know of software that will allow\nyou to convert CorelDraw (.CDR) files\ncontaining bitmaps to SCODAL, as this is the\nonly format our bureau's filmrecorder recognises.
I've talked with Mark and he faxed some literature, though it wasn't very helpful-\n  just a list of routine names: _BSplineSurface, _DrawString3D... 241 names.\n  There was a Product Info sheet that explained some of the package capabilities.\n  I also found a review in April/May '92 MacTutor.
Our group recently bought a Mitsubishi P78U video printer and I could use some\nhelp with it.  We bought this thing because it (1) has a parallel data input in\naddition to the usual video signal inputs and (2) claimed to print 256 gray\nlevel images.  However, the manual that came with it only describes how to\nformat the parallel data to print 1 and 4 bit/pixel images.  After some initial\nproblems with the parallel interface I now have this thing running from a\nparallel port of an Hewlett-Packard workstation and I can print 1 and 4\nbit/pixel images just fine.  I called the Mitsubishi people and asked about the\n256 level claim and they said that was only available when used with the video\nsignal inputs.  This was not mentioned in the sales literature.  However they\ndid say the P78U can do 6 bit/pixel (64 level) images in parallel mode, but\nthey didn't have any information about how to program it to do so, and they\nwould call Japan, etc.\n\nFrankly, I find it hard to believe that if this thing can do 8 bit/pixel images\nfrom the video source, it can't store 8 bits/pixel in the memory.  It's not\nlike memory is that expensive any more.  If anybody has any information on\ngetting 6 bit/pixel (or even 8 bit/pixel) images out of this thing, I would\ngreatly appreciate your sending it to me.\n\nThanks.

A while back someone had several equations which could be used for changing 3 f\niltered grey scale images into one true color image.  This is possible because\nit's the same theory used by most color scanners.

There was a very useful article in one of the 1989 issues of\nTransactions On Graphics. I believe Maureen Stone was one of\nthe authors. Sorry not to be more specific. I don't have the\nreference here with me.\n\nThe article actually was more general than this, giving a way to decide\nwhether a given (cubic) Bezier curve contains cusps, intersection points\nor whatever wierdness. The same treatment is also available in SIGGRAPH 89\ncourse notes for the course called "Math for Siggraph" or something like\nthat.

The 68070 is a variation of the 68010 that was done a few years ago by\nthe European partners of Motorola. It has some integrated I/O controllers\nand half a MMU, but otherwise it's a 68010. Think of it the same as\nthe 8086 and 80186 were.\n\n		Burkhard Neidecker-Lutz
I have an ATI Graph. Ultra Pro VLB w/2 megs, and have a small question\nabout Graphics Workshop for Windows.  When I exit from it it says my\ncurrent driver can handle on 32768 colors when I am actually in \n1024x768x65000 color mode.  Is this a driver problem, a GWS error, or\nwhat?  I am using the 1.5(59) driver under Win 3.1.  It correctly\nstates that I can display 16M colors when I switch to 800x600x24bit,\nthough.\nAnother question- Anybody know of any Viewers that support this card\nother than Windows viewers?\nAny help would be appreciated.
Off the top of my head, I might try:\n\nGiven: p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4\n\nFind:  p_c (center of sphere determined by p_1, ..., p_4), \n       dist(p_c, p_i) (radius)\n\np_c is the same distance from our four points, so\ndist(p_c,p_1) = dist(p_c,p_2) = dist(p_c,p_3) = dist(p_c,p_4) \n\nOf course, we can square the whole thing to get rid of square roots:\ndistsq(p_c,p_1) = distsq(p_c,p_2) = distsq(p_c,p_3) = distsq(p_c,p_4) \n\nPlug in the variables into the distance formula, simplify, and the \nx^2_c, y^2_c, and z^2_c terms cancel out, leaving you with three \nlinearly independent equations and three unknowns (x_c, y_c, z_c).  \nSolve using your favorite method.  :)\n\n\nAll the best,\n\n- John :)\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDr. John S.

: Concerning the proposed newsgroup split, I personally am not in favor of\n: doing this.  I learn an awful lot about all aspects of graphics by reading\n: this group, from code to hardware to algorithms.  I just think making 5\n: different groups out of this is a wate, and will only result in a few posts\n: a week per group.  I kind of like the convenience of having one big forum\n: for discussing all aspects of graphics.  Anyone else feel this way?\n: Just curious.\n: \n: \n: Daemon\n: \n\nYes. I also like knowing where to go to ask a question without getting\nhell for putting it in the wrong newsgroup.
Just because the 68070 can run upto 15Mhz doesn't mean the CD-I\nis running at that speed.  I said -> I understand it is a 68070 running\nat something like 7Mhz.  I am not sure, but I think I read this a long\ntime ago.\n\n   Anyway, still with 15Mhz, you need sprites for a lot of tricks for\nmaking cool awesome games (read psygnosis).

However, expressing\n    complex notions such as God and infinity or a seemingly well\n    defined concept such as a flower can present challenges which far\n    exceed their technical skills.\n\n    The explosive use of computers as visualization and expression\n    tools has compounded this problem.  In hypermedia, multimedia and\n    virtual reality systems vast amounts of information confront the\n    observer or participant.  Wading through a multitude of\n    simultaneous images and sounds in possibly unfamiliar\n    representions, a confounded user asks: "What does it all mean?"\n\n    Since image construction, transmission, reception, decipherment and\n    ultimate understanding are complex tasks, strongly influenced by\n    physiology, education and culture; and, since electronic media\n    radically amplify each processing step, then we, as electronic\n    communicators, must determine the fundamental paradigms for\n    composing imagery for understanding.\n\n    Therefore, the purpose of this conference is to bring together a\n    breadth of disciplines, including, but not limited to, the\n    physical, biological and computational sciences, technology, art,\n    psychology, philosophy, and education, in order to define and\n    discuss the issues essential to image understanding within the\n    computer graphics context.\n\n\n    FEATURED SPEAKERS INCLUDE:\n\n        Psychology/Perception:\n            Marc De May, University of Ghent\n            Beverly J.

Has anybody gotten CVIEW to work in 32k or 64k color mode on a Trident\n8900c hi-color card? At best the colors come out screwed up, and at worst the \nprogram hangs. I loaded the VESA driver, and the same thing happens on 2 \ndifferent machines.\n\n	If it doesn't work on the Trident, does anybody know of a viewer that \ndoes?

Look for edge inconsistencies.  Consider two vertices, p and q, which\nare connected by at least one edge.\n\nIf (p,q) is an edge, then (q,p) should *not* appear.  \n\nIf *both* (p,q) and (q,p) appear as edges, then the surface "flips" when\nyou travel across that edge.  This is bad.  \n\nAssuming (warning...warning...warning) that you have an otherwise\nacceptable surface - you can pick an edge, any edge, and traverse the\nsurface enforcing consistency with that edge.  \n\n    0) pick an edge (p,q), and mark it as "OK"\n    1) for each face, F, containing this edge (if more than 2, oops)\n       make sure that all edges in F are consistent (i.e., the Face\n       should be [(p,q),(q,r),(r,s),(s,t),(t,p)]).  Flip those which\n       are wrong. Mark all of the edges in F as "OK",\n       and add them to a queue (check for duplicates, and especially\n       inconsistencies - don't let the queue have both (p,q) and (q,p)). \n    2) remove an edge from the queue, and go to 1).\n\nIf a *marked* edge is discovered to be inconsistent, then you lose.\n\nIf step 1) finds more than one face sharing a particular edge, then you\nlose. \n    \nOtherwise, when done, all of the edges will be consistent.  Which means\nthat all of the surface normals will either point IN or OUT.  Deciding\nwhich way is OUT is left as an exercise...
Okay, I've received a whole lot of requests for the movie, so for\nsimplicity's sake I can't mail out any more than I've already received (as\nof 16:30 EDT, Tuesday).  Maybe it'll pop up on a site sooner or later.
For better worse, the source on this on is Michael Barnsley. His article\nin The Science of Fractal Images (Peitgen et al) is a fair-to-middling\nintro. Barnsley's book Fractals Everywhere is a more thorough treatment.\nThe book covers Iterated Function Systems in general, and their application\nto image compression is clear from the text.
This seems to be a simple problem but I just cannot solve it.\nI wrote a C program to draw some polygons on the screen, and I want to \nprint it on my printer. So, I press "print-screen" on the keyboard.\nThe problem is the printer just print out some ASCII characters.\nIs there any other way to print the screen without using "print-screen"????\nPlease help!
Finding the circumcenter of a tetrahedron is discussed on page 33 in\n\nCONTOURING: A guide to the analysis and display of spatial data,\nby Dave Watson, Pergamon Press,  1992, ISBN 0 08 040286 0, 321p.\n\nEach pair of tetrahedral vertices define a plane which is a \nperpendicular bisector of the line between that pair.  Express each\nplane in the form Ax + By + Cz = D\nand solve the set of simultaneous equations from any three of those\nplanes that have a vertex in common (all vertices are used).  \nThe solution is the circumcenter.

I'm sure it is, and I am not amused.  Every time I read that part of the\nTIFF spec, it infuriates me- and I'm none too happy about the\ncomplexity of the spec anyway- because I think their "arbitrary but\ncarefully chosen number" is neither.  Additionally, I find their\nchoice of 4 bytes to begin a file with meaningless of themselves- why\nnot just use the letters "TIFF"?\n\n(And no, I don't think they should have bothered to support both word\norders either- and I've found that many TIFF readers actually\ndon't.)
G'day all,\n\nCan anybody point me at a utility which will read/convert/crop/whatnot/\ndisplay HDF image files ? I've had a look at the HDF stuff under NCSA \nand it must take an award for odd directory structure, strange storage\napproaches and minimalist documentation :-)\n\nPart of the problem is that I want to look at large (5MB+) HDF files and\ncrop out a section. Ideally I would like a hdftoppm type of utility, from\nwhich I can then use the PBMplus stuff quite merrily. I can convert the cropped\npart into another format for viewing/animation.\n\nOtherwise, can someone please explain how to set up the NCSA Visualisation S/W\nfor HDF (3.2.r5 or 3.3beta) and do the above cropping/etc. This is for\nSuns with SunOS 4.1.2.\n\nAny help GREATLY appreciated.

Hi! Everyone,\n\nSince some people quickly solved the problem of determining a sphere from\n4 points, I suddenly recalled a problem which is how to find the ellipse\nfrom its offset. For example, given 5 points on the offset, can you find\nthe original ellipse analytically?\n\nI spent two months solving this problem by using analytical method last year,\nbut I failed. Under the pressure, I had to use other method - nonlinear\nprogramming technique to deal with this problem approximately.\n\nAny ideas will be greatly appreciated. Please post here, let the others\nshare our interests.

I am interested in a 2d/3d graphics library which will allow our design\nteam to write graphics software for Unix workstations and be as portable as \npossible.  Eventually this software will have to be moved to Microsoft\nWindows.

-------------------------------------\n	+ ............The OTIS Project '93  +      \n	+ "The Operative Term Is STIMULATE" + \n	-------------------------------------\n	---this file last updated..4-21-93---\n\n\nWHAT IS OTIS?\n\nOTIS is here for the purpose of distributing original artwork\nand photographs over the network for public perusal, scrutiny,    \nand distribution.  Digital immortality.\n\nThe basic idea behind "digital immortality" is that computer networks   \nare here to stay and that anything interesting you deposit on them\nwill be around near-forever.  The GIFs and JPGs of today will be the\nartifacts of a digital future.  Perhaps they'll be put in different\nformats, perhaps only surviving on backup tapes....but they'll be\nthere...and someone will dig them up.  \n \nIf that doesn't interest you... OTIS also offers a forum for critique\nand exhibition of your works....a virtual art gallery that never closes\nand exists in an information dimension where your submissions will hang\nas wallpaper on thousands of glowing monitors.  Suddenly, life is \nbreathed into your work...and by merit of it's stimulus, it will \ntravel the globe on pulses of light and electrons.\n \nSpectators are welcome also, feel free to browse the gallery and \nlet the artists know what you think of their efforts.  Keep your own\ncopies of the images to look at when you've got the gumption...\nthat's what they're here for.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWHERE?             \n\nOTIS currently (as of 4/21/93) has two FTP sites.  \n \n 	141.214.4.135 (projects/otis), the UWI site\n		\n	sunsite.unc.edu (/pub/multimedia/pictures/OTIS), the SUNsite \n	(you can also GOPHER to this site for OTIS as well)\n\nMerely "anonymous FTP" to either site on Internet and change to the\nappropriate directory.  Don't forget to get busy and use the "bin"\ncommand to make sure you're in binary.\n\nOTIS has also been spreading to some dial-up BBS systems around North\nAmerica....the following systems have a substancial supply of\nOTIStuff...\n	Underground Cafe (Omaha) (402.339.0179) 2 lines\n	CyberDen (SanFran?) (415.472.5527)  Usenet Waffle-iron\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n \nHOW DO YOU CONTRIBUTE?\n              \nWhat happens is...you draw a pretty picture or take a lovely   \nphoto, get it scanned into an image file, then either FTP-put\nit in the CONTRIB/Incoming directory or use UUENCODE to send it to me\n(email addresses at eof) in email.  After the image is received,\nit will be put into the correct directory.  Computer originated works\nare also welcome.\n\nOTIS' directories house two types of image files, GIF and JPG.  \nGIF and JPG files require, oddly enough, a GIF or JPG viewer to \nsee.  These viewers are available for all types of computers at \nmost large FTP sites around Internet.  JPG viewers are a bit\ntougher to find.  If you can't find one, but do have a GIF viewer,  \nyou can obtain a JPG-to-GIF conversion program which will change    \nJPG files to a standard GIF format. \n\nOTIS also accepts animation files.      \n\nWhen you submit image files, please send me email at the same time\nstating information about what you uploaded and whether it is to be\nused (in publications or other projects) or if it is merely for people\nto view.  Also, include some biographical information on yourself, we'll\nbe having info-files on each contributing artist and their works.  You \ncan also just upload a text-file of info about yourself (instead of \nemailing).\n\nIf you have pictures, but no scanner, there is hope.  Merely send\ncopies to:\n\nThe OTIS Project\nc/o Ed Stastny\nPO BX 241113\nOmaha, NE 68124-1113\n\nI will either scan them myself or get them to someone who will  \nscan them.  Include an ample SASE if you want your stuff back.  \nAlso include information on each image, preferably a 1-3 line \ndescription of the image that we can include in the infofile in the\ndirectory where it's finally put.  If you have preferences as to what\nthe images are to be named, include those as well.  \n \nConversely, if you have a scanner and would like to help out, please\ncontact me and we'll arrange things.\n\nIf you want to submit your works by disk, peachy.  Merely send a 3.5"\ndisk to the above address (Omaha) and a SASE if you want your disk back.\nThis is good for people who don't have direct access to encoders or FTP,\nbut do have access to a scanner.  We accept disks in either Mac or IBM\ncompatible format.  If possible, please submit image files as GIF or\nJPG.  If you can't...we can convert from most formats...we'd just rather\nnot have to.\n\nAt senders request, we can also fill disks with as much OTIS as they\ncan stand.  Even if you don't have stuff to contribute, you can send\na blank disk and an SASE (or $2.50 for disk, postage and packing) to \nget a slab-o-OTIS.\n\nAs of 04/21/93, we're at about 18 megabytes of files, and growing.  \nEmail me for current archive size and directory.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDISTRIBUTION?\n\nThe images distributed by the OTIS project may be distributed freely   \non the condition that the original filename is kept and that it is\nnot altered in any way (save to convert from one image format to\nanother).  In fact, we encourage files to be distributed to local \nbulletin boards and such.  If you could, please transport the\nappropriate text files along with the images.  \n \nIt would also be nice if you'd send me a note when you did post images\nfrom OTIS to your local bbs.  I just want to keep track of them so\nparticipants can have some idea how widespread their stuff is.\n\nIt's the purpose of OTIS to get these images spread out as much as\npossible.  If you have the time, please upload a few to your favorite\nBBS system....or even just post this "info-file" there.  It would be\nkeen of you.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUSE?\n\nIf you want to use any of the works you find on the OTIS directory,\nyou'll have to check to see if permission has been granted and the \nstipulations of the permission (such as free copy of publication, or\nfull address credit).  You will either find this in the ".rm" file for    \nthe image or series of images...or in the "Artists" directory under the \nArtists name.  If permission isn't explicitly given, then you'll have \nto contact the artist to ask for it.  If no info is available, email\nme (ed@cwis.unomaha.edu), and I'll get in contact with the artist for \nyou, or give you their contact information.\n \nWhen you DO use permitted work, it's always courteous to let the artist\nknow about it, perhaps even send them a free copy or some such\ncompensation for their files.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNAMING IMAGES?\n\nPlease keep the names of your files in "dos" format.  That means, keep\nthe filename (before .jpg or .gif) to eight characters or less.  The way\nI usually do it is to use the initials of the artist, plus a three or\nfour digit "code" for the series of images, plus the series number.\nThus, Leonardo DeVinci's fifth mechanical drawing would be something\nlike:\n \n	ldmek5.gif     OR    ldmek5.jpg    OR    ldmech5.gif   ETC\n\nKeeping the names under 8 characters assures that the filename will\nremain intact on all systems.  \n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------- \n\nCREATING IMAGE FILES?\n\nWhen creating image files, be sure to at least include your name\nsomewhere on or below the picture.  This gives people a reference in\ncase they'd like to contact you.  You may also want to include a title,\naddress or other information you'd like people to know.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHMMM?!\n\nThat's about it for now.  More "guidelines" will be added as needed.\nYour input is expected.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDISCLAIMER:  The OTIS Project has no connection to the Church of OTIS  \n 	     (a sumerian deity) or it's followers, be they pope, priest,\n	     or ezine administrator.  We do take sacrifices and donations\n	     however.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDISCLAIMER:  The OTIS Project is here for the distribution of original \n 	     image files.  The files will go to the public at large.  \n	     It's possible, as with any form of mass-media, that someone\n	     could unscrupulously use your images for financial gain.  \n    	     Unless you've given permission for that, it's illegal.  OTIS\n	     takes no responsibility for this.  In simple terms, all rights\n	     revert to the author/artist.  To leave an image on OTIS is to \n	     give permission for it to be viewed, copied and distributed \n	     electronically.  If you don't want your images distributed     \n	     all-over, don't upload them.  To leave an image on OTIS is\n	     NOT giving permission to have it used in any publication or\n	     broadcast that incurs profit (this includes, but is not \n	     limited to, magazines, newsletters, clip-art software,        \n	     screen-printed clothing, etc).  You must give specific\n	     permission for this sort of usage.  \n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRemember, the operative term is "stimulate".  If you know of people\nthat'd be interested in this sort of thing...get them involved...kick'm\nin the booty....offer them free food...whatever...\n\n....e  (ed@cwis.unomaha.edu)\n       (ed@sunsite.unc.edu)

I bought the diamond stealth 24 a few months ago.  it seems to be a\ngreat card especially with my multimedia presentations.  It runs graphics\nand animation as well as some near full motion video very well.  The only\nthing I can tell that it lacks is speed above 256 colors.  Its qualit in\nbetween 256 and 16.7 million collors un unreal but you definitly\ncompromise speed.  It seems to be a great card for graphics and it comes\nwith some great software, but Im not so sure about the excelerator\npart.  I used to own a paridise and it doesnt seem to be much faster\nthan that.  One thing I do like is that it loads its own vesa driver\nfrom ROM at startup, (I think) because I have never had to load it for\nlinks386 or any other programs that require special VESA drivers at\nstartup. \n\n\n\ngromi a16pd\n\n\n                                       HINTMATT@BA.BA.ISU.EDU

Yeah - they also gave it their "Editor's Choice" in the run-down of\ngraphics accelerators they tested in the previous issue, which is why\nI bought (and then returned) mine.  The only conclusion I can come up with\nis that PC Magazine has wildly different ways on determining the worthiness\nof a video card than I do.

Concerning the proposed newsgroup split, I personally am not in favor of\n   doing this.  I learn an awful lot about all aspects of graphics by reading\n   this group, from code to hardware to algorithms.  I just think making 5\n   different groups out of this is a wate, and will only result in a few posts\n   a week per group.  I kind of like the convenience of having one big forum\n   for discussing all aspects of graphics.  Anyone else feel this way?\n   Just curious.\n\nI disagree.  You could learn the same amount by reading all the\nsplit groups, and it would make things easier for those of us\nwho are less omnivorous.  There is no "waste" in creating news\ngroups -- its just a bit of shuffling about.  I have no problem\nwith only a few posts per week per group - I spend too much time\non this as it is.
Do you have Weitek's address/phone number?  I'd like to get some information\nabout this chip.
Hi guys.\n\nI am scanning in a color image and it looks fine on the screen.  When I \nconverted it into PCX,BMP,GIF files so as to get it into MS Windows the colors\ngot much lighter.  For example the yellows became white.  Any ideas?
'Illumination and Color in Computer Generated Imagery' by Roy Hall contains c\nsource for several famous illumination models, including Bouknight, Phong,\nBlinn, Whitted, and Hall illumination models. If you want an introduction to\nshading you might look through the book 'Writing a Raytracer' edited by\nGlassner. Also, the book 'Procedural elements for Computer Graphics' by Rogers\nis a good reference. Source for code in these book are available on the net i \nbelieve, you might check out nic.funet.fi or some site closer to you carrying \ngraphics related stuff. \n\nHope this is what you were asking for.\n-- \nTorgeir Veimo\n\nStudying at the University of Bergen\n\n"...I'm gona wave my freak flag high!"

[Please, note the Newsgroups.]\n\nRecent discussion about XV's problems were held in some newsgroup.\nHere is some text users of XV might find interesting.\nI have added more to text to this collection article, so read on, even\nyou so my articles a while ago.\n\nI hope author of XV corrects those problems as best he can, so fine\nprogram XV is that it is worth of improving.\n(I have also minor ideas for 24bit XV, e-mail me for them.)\n\nAny misundertanding of mine is understandable.\n\n\nJuhana Kouhia\n\n\n==clip==\n\n[ ..deleted..]\n\nNote that 'xv' saves only 8bit/rasterized images; that means that\nthe saved jpegs are just like jpeg-to-gif-to-jpeg quality.\nAlso, there's three kind of 8bit quantizers; your final image quality\ndepends on them too.\n \nThis were the situation when I read jpeg FAQ a while ago.\n \nIMHO, it is design error of 'xv'; there should not be such confusing\nerrors in programs.\nThere's two errors:\n  -xv allows the saving of 8bit/rasterized image as jpeg even the\n   original is 24bit -- saving 8bit/rasterized image instead of\n   original 24bit should be a special case\n  -xv allows saving the 8bit/rasterized image made with any quantizer\n   -- the main case should be that 'xv' quantizes the image with the\n   best quantizer available before saving the image to a file; lousier\n   quantizers should be just for viewing purposes (and a special cases\n   in saving the image, if at all)\n \n==clip==\n\n==clip==\n\n[ ..deleted..]\n\nIt is limit of *XV*, but not limit of design.\nIt is error in design.\nIt is error that 8bit/quantized/rasterized images are stored as jpegs;\njpeg is not designed to that.\n\nAs matter of fact, I'm sure when XV were designed 24bit displays were\nknown. It is not bad error to program a program for 8bit images only\nat that time, but when 24bit image formats are included to program the\nwhole design should be changed to support 24bit images.\nThat were not done and now we have\n -the program violate jpeg design (and any 24bit image format)\n -the program has human interface errors.\n\nOtherway is to drop saving images as jpegs or any 24bit format without\nclearly saying that it is special case and not expected in normal use.\n\n[ ..deleted.. ]\n\n==clip==\n\nSome new items follows.\n\n==clip==\n\nI have seen that XV quantizes the image sometimes poorly with -best24\noption than with default option we have.\nThe reason surely is the quantizer used as -best24; it is (surprise)\nthe same than used in ppmquant.\n\nIf you remember, I have tested some quantizers. In that test I found\nthat rlequant (with default) is best, then comes djpeg, fbmquant, xv\n(our default) in that order. In my test ppmquant suggeeded very poorly\n-- it actually gave image with bad artifacts.\n\nI don't know is ppmquant improved any, but I expect no.\nSo, use of XV's -best24 option is not very good idea.\n\nI suggest that author of XV changes the quantizer to the one used in\nrlequant -- I'm sure rle-people gives permission.\n(Another could be one used in ImageMagick; I have not tested it, so I\ncan say nothing about it.)\n\n==clip==\n\n==clip==\n\nSome minor bugs in human interface are:\n\nKey pressings and cursor clicks goes to a buffer; Often it happens\nthat I make click errors or press keyboard when cursor is in the wrong\nplace. It is very annoying when you have waited image to come about\nfive minutes and then it is gone away immediately.\nThe buffer should be cleaned when the image is complete.\n\nAlso, good idea is to wait few seconds before activating keyboard\nand mouse for XV after the image is completed.\nOften it happens that image pops to the screen quickly, just when\nI'm writing something with editor or such. Those key pressings\nthen go to XV and image has gone or something weird.\n\nIn the color editor, when I turn a color meter and release it, XV\nupdates the images. It is impossible to change all RGB values first\nand then get the updated image. It is annoying wait image to be\nupdated when the setting are not ready yet.\nI suggest of adding an 'apply' button to update the exchanges done.
Hi, \n\n	Is anyone into medical imaging?  I have a good ray tracing background,\nand I'm interested in that field.  Could you point me to some sources?  Or\nbetter yet, if you have any experience, do you want to talk about what's\ngoing on or what you're working on?

No.  That's *not* what I was complaining about, nor did I intend to\nsuggest that DEC was any better than SGI (let me tell you about the\nLynx some day, but be prepared with a large sedative if you do...).  My\ncomment regarding DEC was to indicate that I might be open to other vendors\nthat supported OpenGL, rather than deal further with SGI.\n\nWhat I *am* annoyed about is the fact that we were led to believe that\nwe *would* be able to upgrade to a multiprocessor version of the\nCrimson without the assistance of a fork lift truck.\n\nI'm also annoyed about being sold *several* Personal IRISes at a\nprevious site on the understanding *that* architecture would be around\nfor a while, rather than being flushed.\n\nNow I understand that SGI is responsible to its investors and has to\nkeep showing a positive quarterly bottom line (odd that I found myself\npressured on at least two occasions to get the business on the books\njust before the end of the quarter), but I'm just a little tired of\ngetting boned in the process.\n\nMaybe it's because my lab buys SGIs in onesies and twosies, so we\naren't entitled to a "peek under the covers" as the Big Kids (NASA,\nfor instance) are.  This lab, and I suspect that a lot of other labs\nand organizations, doesn't have a load of money to spend on computers\nevery year, so we can't be out buying new systems on a regular basis.\nThe boxes that we buy now will have to last us pretty much through the\nentire grant period of five years and, in some case, beyond.  That\nmeans that I need to buy the best piece of equipment that I can when I\nhave the money, not some product that was built, to paraphrase one\nprevious poster's words, 'to fill a niche' to compete with some other\nvendor.  I'm going to be looking at this box for the next five years.\nAnd every time I look at it, I'm going to think about SGI and how I\ncould have better spent my money (actually *your* money, since we're\nsupported almost entirely by Federal tax dollars).\n\nNow you'll have to pardon me while I go off and hiss and fume in a\ncorner somewhere and think dark, libelous thoughts.\n\n							spl
I am working on a project where we are going to be including\nboth still and moving grapics within a database.  Of course\nJPEG and MPEG come to mind as the formats of choice for the\nvarious files.  However, from what I read on the Net, it seems\nas if there are several different forms of each of these.\n\nWhat I want to do, is settle on a file format which I can count\non as being a standard format 10 years from now.  I know Apple is going\nto support Quicktime on the new Power PC's and, so this\nmay be the format of choice.\n\nWhat format does Apple's Quicktime use for their products?  I guess\nit is some kind of MPEG for their motion picture. Is it any different\nthan standard MPEG files?\n\nThanx for any info!
Actually I am trying to write something like this but I encounter some\nproblems, amongst them:\n\n- drawing a 3d wireframe view of a quadric/quartic requires that you have\nthe explicit equation of the quadric/quartic (x, y, z functions of some\nparameters). How to convert the implicit equation used by PoV to an\nexplicit one? Is it mathematically always possible?

I'm planning to buy a new VLB/EISA system with a good graphic performance.\nSo far I looked at the ATI GUP VLB as my favorite graphics-card. But \nrecently I heard something about a new card from  Miro. It was the Miro\nCrystal 24s with 3 MB and True Color support up to 1024x768. It costs just a\nlittle more than the ATI. So, can't decide which one matches better my needs.\nAny technical references and performance comparisons (especially from the\nMiro card) would be greatly appreciated.\n\n-Peter-\n\nE-Mail : kohut1@urz.unibas.ch

It's supposedly a high-performance chip based upon workstation graphics\naccelerators.  It's quite fast (I have 7), but as usual with new boards/chips\nthe drivers are buggy for Windows.  As far as Winmarks go, it depends upon\nthe version.  I think I got 42M winmarks with version 3.11.  2.5 yielded the\n50+ number.  I've also benchmarked this with Wintach at over 65 (from memory\nas well).\n\nAs far as the low-level stuff goes, it looks pretty nice.  It's got this\nquadrilateral fill command that requires just the four points.\n\nIt's very fast, but beware of buggy drivers, and otherwise no non-windows\nsupport.

THIS VERSION\nNOW RUNS WITH THINK C, I PROMISE! The Docs now contain a chapter for\nC programmers on how to use the GrafSys. If you have problems, feel free \nto contact me.\nThe other change is that I removed the FastPerfTrig calls from\nthe FPU version to make it run faster.\n\nThose of you who don't know what all this is about, read on.\n\n********\n\nProgrammers 3D GrafSys -- What it is:\n-------------------------------------\n\nDidn't you always have this great game in mind where you needed some way of \ndrawing three-dimensional scenes? \n\nDidn't you always want to write this program that visualized the structure \nof three-dimensional molecules?\n\nAnd didn't the task of writing your 3D conversions routines keep you from \nactually doing it?\n\nWell if the answer to any of the above questions is 'Yes, but what has it to \ndo with this package???' , read on.\n\nGrafSys is a THINK Pascal/C library that provides you with simple routines \nfor building, saving, loading (as resources), and manipulating \n(independent rotating around arbitrary achses, translating and scaling) \nthree dimensional objects. Objects, not just simple single-line drawings.\n\nGrafSys supports full 3D clipping, animation and some (primitive) hidden-\nline/hidden-surface drawing with simple commands from within YOUR PROGRAM.\n\nGrafSys also supports full eye control with both perspective and parallel\nprojections (If you can't understand a word, don't worry, this is just showing\noff for those who know about it. The docs that come with it will try to explain\nwhat it all means later on). \n\nGrafSys provides a powerful interface to supply your own drawing routines with\ndata so you can use GrafSys to do the 3D transformations and your own routines\nto do the actual drawing. (Note that GrafSys also provides drawing routines so\nyou don't have to worry about that if you don't want to)\n\nGrafSys 1.11 comes in two versions. One for the 881 and 020 or above \nprocessors. The other version uses fixed-point arithmetic and runs on any Mac.\nBoth versions are *100% source compatibel*. \n\nGrafSys comes with an extensive manual that teaches you the fundamentals of 3D\ngraphics and how to use the package.\n\nIf demand is big enough I will convert the GrafSys to an object-class library. \nHowever, I feelt that the way it is implemented now makes it easier to use for\na lot more people than the select 'OOP-Guild'.\n\nGrafSys is free for any non-commercial usage. Read the documentation enclosed.

There is another useful method based on Least Sqyares Estimation of the sphere equation parameters.\n\nThe points (x,y,z) on a spherical surface with radius R and center (a,b,c) can be written as \n\n   (x-a)^2 + (y-b)^2 + (z-c)^2 = R^2\n\nThis equation can be rewritten into the following form:  \n\n   2ax + 2by + 2cz + R^2 - a^2 - b^2 -c^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2\n\nApproximate the left hand part by   F(x,y,z) = p1.x + p2.x + p3.z + p4.1\n\nFor all datapoints, i.c. 4, determine the 4 parameters p1..p4 which minimise the average error |F(x,y,z) - x^2 - y^2 - z^2|^2.\n\nIn 'Numerical Recipes in C' can be found algorithms to solve these parameters.\n\nThe best fitting sphere will have \n- center (a,b,c) = (p1/2, p2/2, p3/2)\n- radius R = sqrt(p4 + a.a + b.b + c.c).\n\nSo, at last, will this solve you sphere estination problem, at least for the most situations I think ?.

The package will be described and demonstrated, and some of the \ntechnical issues will be discussed.  Marketing plans will be outlined.  The \ntalk will also present some of the technical and business problems increasingly \nconfronting small startup software companies today, and some of the \nopportunities this situation presents.\n\nTime after the event will be allocated for hands-on demonstrations to \ninterested parties.  Silicon Graphics is graciously providing an Indigo for \nthis event.  Myck Kupka will also be demonstrating his computerized interactive \nreflective stereoscope, which is installed upstairs in the McLuhan Centre, so \nfeel free to drop by for a demonstration before or after the event. BTW, be \nsure to sing "Happy Birthday, Myck"...\n\nThe names of nominees for our Siggraph executive offices will be announced at \nthis meeting.  Nominations will still be open until the election at our \nMay 18th event; call Myck Kupka at 465-0943 or fax to 465-0729.  \n\nDirections: The McLuhan Coachhouse is on the east side of Queen's Park \nCrescent, just NORTH of Wellesley, SOUTH of St. Joseph St., BEHIND (EAST of) \n39 Queen's Park Crescent, which is the centre for Mediaeval Studies.

I used this combination for a while - A QCR-Z recorder,\nI think - and as far as I remember Corel can EXPORT in\nSCODAL (.scd) format.  Just select 'EXPORT' on the main\nfile menu.  This may not be implemented in earlier versions,\nof course, in which case you're on your own!!!\n\nAlso, I seem to think that the s/w for the QCR-Z (at the time)\ndid strange (and very undesirable) things if ANY part of the\npic was outside the screen area on Corel.  I once spent an\nafternoon painfully discovering that ONE pixel had somehow\nstrayed off-screen, causing my whole slide to be blank!!!\n\nThe QCR-Z also couldn't handle grad-fill over grad-fill -\nso if you use a graduated colour background, if you then\ngrad-fill an object on top of this, the fill appears on the\nfinal slide as a circle (I think) and TOTALLY IGNORES the\nshape of the object being filled!!!\n\nOf course, if the recorder isn't a QCR, you can ignore all\nthis and feel suitably :-)

OpenGL is a graphics programming library and as such is a great, portable\ninterface for the development of interactive 3D graphics applications. It\nis not, however, an indicator of performance, as that will vary strongly\nfrom machine to machine and vendor to vendor.  SGI is committed to high\nperformance interactive graphics systems and software tools, so OpenGL\nmeans that you can port easily from SGI to other platforms, there is no\nguarantee that your performance would be comparable.\n\n\nIf your sales representative truly mislead you, then you should have a\nvalid grievance against us which you should carry up to your local SGI\nsales management team. Feel free to contact the local branch manager...we\nunderstand that repeat sales come from satisfied customers, so give it a\nshot.\n\n\nAs one of the previous posts stated, the Personal IRIS was introduced in\n1988 and grew to include the 4D/20, 4D/25, 4D/30 and 4D/35 as clock rates\nsped up over time. As a rule of thumb, SGI platforms live for about 4-5\nyears. This was true of the motorola-based 3000 series ('85-'89), the PI\n('88-'93), the Professional Series (the early 4D's - '86-'90), the Power\nSeries parallel systems ('88-'93). Individual CPU subsystems running at a\nparticular clock rate usually live for about 2 years. New graphics\narchitectures at the high end (GT, VGX, RealityEngine) are released every\n18 months to 2 years.\n\nThese are the facts of life.  If we look at these machines, they become\nalmost archaic after four years, and we have to come out with a new\nplatform (like Indigo, Onyx, Challenge) which has higher bus bandwidths,\nfaster CPUs, faster graphics and I/O, and larger disk capacities. If we\ndon't, we become uncompetitive.\n\nFrom the user perspective, you have to buy a machine that meets your\ncurrent needs and makes economic sense today.  You can't wait to buy, but\nif you need a guaranteed upgrade path for the machine, ask the Sales Rep\nfor one in writing. If it's feasible, they should be able to do that. Some\nof our upgrade paths have specific programs associated with them, such as\nthe Performance Protection Program for older R3000-based Power Series\nmultiprocessing systems which allowed purchasers of those systems to obtain\na guaranteed upgrade price for moving to the new Onyx or Challenge\nR4400-based 64-bit multiprocessor systems.\n\n\nIf that's happening, it's becausing of misunderstandings or\nmis-communication, not because SGI is directly attempting to annoy our\ncustomer base.\n\n\nMost SGI customers are onesy-twosey types, but regardless, we rarely give a\ngreat deal of notice when we are about to introduce a new system because\nagain, like a previous post stated, if we pre-announced and the schedule\nslipped, we would mess up our potential customers schedules (when they were\ncounting on the availability of the new systems on a particular date) and\nwould also look awfully bad to both our investors and the financial\nanalysts who watch us most carefully to see if we are meeting our\ncommitments.\n\n\nFive years is an awfully long time in computer years. New processor\ntechnologies are arriving every 1-2 years, making a 5 year old computer at\nleast 2 and probably 3 generations behind the times. The competitive nature\nof the market is demanding that rate of development, so if your timing is\nreally 5 years between purchases, you have to accept the limited viability\nof whatever architecture you buy into from any vendor.\n\nThere are some realities about the computer biz that we all have to live\nwith, but keeping customers happy is the most important, so don't give up,\nwe know it.\n\nJosh   |:-)\n\n--

I am working on a program to display 3d wireframe models with the user\nbeing able to arbitrarily change any of the viewing parameters.  Also,\nthe wireframe objects are also going to have dynamic attributes so\nthat they can move around while the user is "exploring" the wireframe\nworld.\n\nTo do this, I am thinking of using the SRGP package described in the\nVan Dam, Foley and Feiner book, but I was wondering if there was\nanother PD graphics package out there which was faster.  I would like\nto make the program as fast as possible so that it provides\nsatisfactory real time performance on a Sun IPX.\n\nIdeally, I'm looking for a PD graphics package which will allow me to\nopen a new window under X, and allow me to draw lines within the\nwindow.  Also, it would also need to have some sort of event driven\ninteraction handling since the user is going to move around the\nwireframe models using the keyboard.\n\nIf you know or wrote such a package, I would be grateful if you could\ndirect me to a ftp site which contains the package.\n\nThank you.

If you have the GRASP animation system, then yes, it's quite easy.\nYou simply use GLIB to extract the image (each "frame" in a .GL is\nactually a complete .PCX or .CLP file), then use one of MANY available\nutilities to convert it.  If you don't have the GRASP package, I'm afraid\nI can't help you.  Sorry.\n     By the way, before you ask, GRASP (GRaphics Animation System for\nProfessionals) is a commercial product that sells for just over US$300\nfrom most mail-order companies I've seen.  And no, I don't have it.  :)\n \n \n                                               Corey Webb
Just as a matter of interest, a self-promo computer graphics sequence \nthat one of the local TV stations used to play quite a lot a couple of\nyears ago showed a 3D flyover of Australia from the West coast to the\nEast.  The clouds were quite recognisable as fuzzy, flat, white\nMandlebrot sets!!
I sure did use version 3.2. It works fine with most software but NOT\nwith Animator Pro and that one is quite important to me. Pretty\nuseless program without that thing working IMHO.\nSo I hope the author can fix that.\n\n/Daniel...
Yes, I do.  A couple of years ago, I did a comparison of the two\nproducts.  Some of this may have changed, but here goes.\n\nAs far as a PHIGS+ implementation, Figaro+ is fine.  But, its PHIGS!\nPersonally, I hate PHIGS because I find it is too low level.  I also\ndislike structure editing, which I find impossible, but enough about\nPHIGS.\n\nI have found HOOPS to be a system that is full-featured and easy to\nuse.  They support all of their rendering methods in software when\nthere is no hardware support, their documentation is good, and they\nare easily portable to other systems.\n\nI would be happy to elaborate further if you have more specific\nquestions.

I can't fiqure this out.  I have properly compiled pov on a unix machine\nrunning SunOS 4.1.3  The problem is that when I run the sample .pov files and\nuse the EXACT same parameters when compiling different .tga outputs.  Some\nof the .tga's are okay, and other's are unrecognizable by any software.
Read Issue #2 of Wired Magazine.  It has a long article on the "hype" of\n3DO.  I've noticed that every article talks with the designers and how\n"great" it is, but never show any pictures of the output (or at least\npictures that one can understand)
I agree with you.
Does anyone out there have or know of,  line drawing USA map?\n\n\nThanks very much in advance,\nHoi

I would like to program Tseng ET4000 to nonstandard 1024x768 mode by\nswitching to standard 1024x768 mode using BIOS and than changing some\ntiming details (0x3D4 registers 0x00-0x1F) but I don't know how to\nselect 36 MHz pixel clock I need. The BIOS function selects 40 MHz.\n\nIs there anybody who knows where to obtain technical info about this.\nI am also interested in any other technical information about Tseng ET4000\nand Trident 8900 and 9000 chipsets.\n\n			thanks very much
Hello, I realize that this might be a FAQ but I have to ask since I don't get a\nchange to read this newsgroup very often.  Anyways for my senior project I need\nto convert an AutoCad file to a TIFF file.  Please I don't need anyone telling\nme that the AutoCAD file is a vector file and the TIFF is a bit map since I\nhave heard that about 100 times already I would just like to know if anyone\nknows how to do this or at least point me to the right direction.
Tommy Frandsen's VGAlib (which is probably what you're talking about)\nwill do the standard VGA modes, some tweaked modes and then the Tseng\nET4000 Super VGA modes. I have an ET4000 and I'm viewing GIF's at\n640x480/256 (I have a lousy/small monitor) with dpg-view on Linux. I\nthink I had to change some constants in the dpg-view sources to make it\nuse the ET4k modes.\n\nVGAlib's sources seem to be designed for easy addition of new Super VGA\nsupport; each mode is an array of register values and there's a program\nthat dumps an array declaration of this kind describing the current\nmode. Haven't tried it though...\n\n(Btw, my version of VGAlib is 1.2.)
I went back and looked at the review again.  They claim there were\nsignificant differences in manipulating a 27 meg test file, but with\nsmaller files, the two platforms were the about the same.  David

The best program I've seen for viewing such files is VPIC.  You'll want version 5.9 or later.  (6.0x is current.)  It allows you to view in 15 and 24 bit modes.  It really is QUITE nice.\n\nNow, for a return question:  Do you run Windows?  If so, what are the dates on your drivers?  The newest ones *I* can find are from around 4-??-92!!  My problem is they conflict with Star Trek: After Dark, and other things as well.  I'm willing to bet that it's the drivers, and NOT the programs.  Anyone out there have info on newer SS24 (NOT X) drivers for windows or OS/2?
By '8 grey level images' you mean 8 items of 1bit images?\nIt does work(!), but it doesn't work if you have more than 1bit\nin your screen and if the screen intensity is non-linear.\n\nWith 2 bit per pixel; there could be 1*c_1 + 4*c_2 timing,\nthis gives 16 levels, but they are linear if screen intensity is\nlinear.\nWith 1*c_1 + 2*c_2 it works, but we have to find the best\ncompinations -- there's 10 levels, but 16 choises; best 10 must be\nchosen. Different compinations for the same level, varies a bit, but\nthe levels keeps their order.\n\nReaders should verify what I wrote... :-)
I've got an old demo disk that I need to view. It was made using RIX Softworks.  \nThe files on the two diskette set end with: .scf\n\nThe demo was VGA resolution (256 colors), but I don't know the spatial  \nresolution.\n\nFirst problem: When I try to run the demo, the screen has two black bars that  \ncut across (horizontally) the screen, in the top third and bottom third of the  \nscreen. The bars are about 1-inch wide. Other than this, the demo (the  \nanimation part) seems to be running fine.\n\nSecond problem: I can't find any graphics program that will open and display  \nthese files. I have a couple of image conversion programs, none mention .scf  \nfiles.\n\nThe system I am using: 486clone, Diamond Speedstar 24, Sony monitor.\n\nAny suggestions?

If you aren't using your com ports for\nanything else, just define them on different com ports.  Define your internal\nmodem to be say, com1, and your external modem to be com3.  You really\nshouldn't have to worry about interrupt conflicts since you won't be using\nboth modems at the same time :).

Hello netters\n\nSorry, I don't know if this is the right way of doing this kind of thing,\nprobably should be a CFV, but since I don't have tha ability to create a \nnews group myself, I just want to start the discussion. \n\nI enjoy reading c.g very much, but I often find it difficult to sort out what\nI'm interested in. Everything from screen-drivers, graphics cards, graphics\nprogramming and graphics programs are discused here. What I'd like is a \ncomp.graphics.programmer news group.\nWhat do you other think.
I think one (not ideal) solution is to use the\ntracing utility (can't remember the name, sorry!)\nincluded in the Corel Draw s/w pack.  It can convert\nbitmaps to Corel art format.  These can then be\nimported into a drawing rather than the bitmap.\nResult - the file is completely in Corel format and\ncan be SCODAL'ed no problem!\n\nBUT the slight problem with this, which makes the\nsolution less than idea, is that the trace utility\nspits out many more points than are necessary to\ndefine the shapes being traced.  Straight lines and\ncurves are both traced as many short segments.\n\nSo... the SCODAL taking *much* longer to\nimage.\n\nThe obvious solution is time-consuming - stripping\nout the extra points by hand using Corel.\n\nOUCH!\nI've done it a few times :-]\n\n                   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nAs I say, if you don't mind the problems, go via the route...\nBITMAP -> COREL (VIA TRACE) ->\nHAND TRIMMING (USING COREL)!!! ->\nCOMBINE WITH MAIN COREL PIC (VIA IMPORT) -> SCODAL

The biggest complaint I\nhave is it is painfully SLOW. It takes about 1 minute to display an image.\nI am use to CSHOW under DOS which takes a split second. Any idea why it\nis so slow under Linux? Anybody have anything better? Plus, anybody have\nthe docs to DPG-View? Thanks!
I'm making a customized paint program in DOS and need an algorithm\nfor reading bitmap files like GIF, PCX, or BMP.  Does anyone have\nsuch an algorithm?

Up until last week, I have been running POVray v1.0 on my 486/33 under DOS5\nwithout any major problems.  Over Easter I increased the memory from 4Meg to\n8Meg, and found that POVray reboots the system every time under DOS5.  I had\na go at running POVray in a DOS window when running Win3.1 on the same system\nand it now works fine, even if a lot slower.  I would like to go back to \nusing POVray directly under DOS, anyone any ideas???\n\nJohn
Is there any program available (free or otherwise) for taking a tiff or gif\nor some other bitmapped file and turning it (or parts of it) into ascii\ncharacters?\n\n  DOS, OS/2 or platform independent programs if possible.
I need some help.  We are upgrading our animation/video editing stand. We\nare looking into the different type of setups for A/B roll and a cuts only\nstation.  We would like this to be controlled by a computer ( brand doesnt matter but maybe MAC, or AMIGA).  Low end to high end system setups would be very\nhelpful. If you have a system or use a system that might be of use, could you\nmail me your system requirements, what it is used for, and all the hardware and\nsoftware that will be necessary to set the system up.  If you need more \ninfo, you  can mail me at   eylerken@u.washington.edu\n\nthanks in advance.
Does anyone know the phone number to a place where i can get\na VGA passthrough?\n\n	I want to hook up my VGA card to my XGA card (whcih you can can).\nAll I need is the cable that connects them.  It is the same type of\ncable that you would connect from your VGA card to say a Video Blaster\nor something.

Hi,\nIt might be nice to know, what's possible on different hard ware platforms.\nBut usually the hard ware is fixed ( in my case either Unix or DOS- PC ).\nSo I'm not much interested in Amiga news. \n\nIn the case of Software, I won't get any comercial software mentioned in this\nnewgroup to run on a Unix- platform, so I'm not interested in this information.\n\nI would suggest to split the group. I don't see the problem of cross-posting.\nThen you need to read just 2 newgroups with half the size. \n\nBUT WHAT WOULD BE MORE IMPORTANT IS TO HAVE A FAQ. THIS WOULD REDUCE THE\nTRAFFIC A LOT.\n\nSincerely, Gerhard
Hi,\n\n	I have a few question about graphics programming in VGA/SVGA :\n\n1. How VESA standard works?  Any documentation for VESA standard?\n\n2. At a higher resolution than 320x200x256 or 640x480x16 VGA mode,\n   where the video memory A0000-AFFFF is no longer sufficient to hold\n   all info, what is the trick to do fast image manipulation?  I\n   heard about memory mapping or video memory bank switching but know\n   nothing on how it is implemented.   Any advice, anyone?  \n\n3. My interest is in 640x480x256 mode.  Should this mode be called\n   SVGA mode?  What is the technique for fast image scrolling for the\n   above mode?  How to deal with different SVGA cards?\n\n\n  Your guidance to books or any other sources to the above questions\nwould be greatly appreciated.

I finally got a 24 bit viewer for my POVRAY generated .TGA files.\n\nIt was written in C by Sean Malloy and he kindly sent me a copy.  He\nwrote it for the same purpose, to view .TGA files using his SpeedStar 24.\n\nIt ONLY works with the SpeedStar 24 and I cannot send copies since it is\nnot my program.  I believe the author may release a version at a future\ntime when the program is more developed.   He may or may not comment on\nthis, as he pleases.\n\nThanks to all who were helpful.\n\nRegards,
I spoke with the author of MacWireFrame earlier today. The cost is $299, but there\n are no license royalties. His name is Eric Johnson in Sacramento, CA phone\n 916/737-1550. He doesn't have email. Very nice guy... very knowledgeable about\n graphics. Seems like he may have a decent package. It's an Object Pascal Framework\n that supposedly has a fairly complete set of geometry creation classes. \n I'm going to check it out and see if it's got what I need for my CAD package.\n\n I also found another package: 3D Graphic Tools by Micro System Options in Seattle.\n The number is: 206/868-5418, also no email. The package is strong at ray tracing,\n I'm not too sure about its geometry creation tools. I also need to look into this\n package some more. I also spoke with the author, Mark Owens, another nice\n guy that seems to know his business. The price is $249, no royalties.
Does anybody out there have or know how to calculate the RGB values \nrequired to set the 256 color VGA palette so that the colors from \n0..255 will give 256 colors  of the rainbow ie red, orange, \nyellow, etc.\n\nAny help would be appreciated. Please email to eeerik@cc.newcastle.edu.au

Any pointers??\n\nthanx in advance
[ description of experiment deleted ]\n\n\n[ more deleted ]\n\n\nA few years ago a friend and I took some 256 grey-level photos from\na 1 bit Mac Plus screen using this method. Displaying all 256 levels\nsynchronized to the 60Hz display took about 10 seconds. After\nexperimenting with different aperture settings and screen\nbrightnesses we found a range that worked well, giving respectable\ncontrast. The quality of the images was pretty good. There were no\nvisible contrast bands.\n\nTo minimize the exposure time the display program built 255\ndifferent 1 bit frames. The first contained a dot only for pixels\nthat had value 255, the second only for pixels that had value 254,\netc. These frames were stored using a sparse data structure that was\nvery fast to 'or' onto the screen in sequence. Creating these\nframes sometimes took 5-10 minutes on that old Mac, but the camera\nshutter was closed during that time anyway. And yes, we wrote\ndirectly to the screen memory. Mea culpa.\n\nOur biggest problem was that small images were displayed in the\ntop left corner of the screen instead of the center. It took\nan extra week to have the film developed and printed, because the\nprocessors took the trouble to manually move the all images into\nthe center of the print. Who'd have guessed?

I've got the 6.0 spec (obviously since I quoted it in my last posting). \nMy gripe about TIFF is that it's far too complicated and nearly\ninfinitely easier to write than to read, which I think hurts your\nacceptance by anything that will need to read those images (e.g.,\npaint programs).\n\nIn a nutshell, I don't think TIFF is salvageable unless the fat is\ntrimmed significantly- and then it wouldn't be TIFF anymore.  They\nkeep trying to cut it back, but it's late now.  Maybe they >will< fix it,\nand change that magic number to signify the lack of compatibility. \nThat would probably make me happy.
Having thought about this, why don't you project the 2 lines onto the 2d\nplane formed by the lines.  Do an intersection calculation in the plane in\n2D, where you're guaranteed a unique solution (unless they're parallel which\nwon't happen in this case), and then use parametric distance along the lines\nfrom the circle centres to determine the exact point of interest.  This\nbypasses the messy error propogation required to do the calculation in 3d.\n\nHope I haven't put my foot in it again!\n\nsteve\n---

Don't get too excited; Signetics, not Motorola, gave the 68070 its number.\nThe 68070, if I understand rightly, uses the 68000 instruction set, and has\nan on-chip serial port and DMA.  (It will run at up to 15 MHz--I'm typing\nat a computer using a 68070 running at that rate, so I know that it can\ndo so--so I seriously doubt the clock rate that ricardo@rchland.vnet.ibm.com\nclaims.)
A very good modeling package I found is `irit' (look for irit.tar.Z).\nHowever there is no converter from it's format to POV format. I postet \na request for such a converter in this group but got no response,\nso I'm considering to write such a program myself.

What are the main advantages of this method?  I have seen it described, and\nthe algiorithm seems a  little bit long.  I developed my own method, which\nrequires that the points be in a counter-clockwise order, and returns\nwhether you are looking at the back or the front, similar to the plane eqn\nmethod.  It uses few calculations however, basically it is several\ncomparisons.  The only disadvantage I see is that it must be done after the\ntransformation from view coordinates to coordinates to display on the\nscreen, which means that a little more calculation isneeded beforehand.  My\nmethod basically figures out whether the points that will appear on the\nscreen are clockwise or counterclockwise.  When looking at the back of\nsomething, the points occur in an opposite direction from the front, so\nmerely by figuring out which way the points go, you can tell whether you are\nlooking at the back or front of a 2d polygon.  Has anyone heard of this\nmethod before?  It is so simple, I doubt i am the first to think of it.\n\nLibertarian, atheist, semi-anarchal Techno-Rat.

Hello again netters,\n	I finally received the information about Imagine for the PC.  They are presently shipping Version 2.0 of the software and will release Version 3.0 in the first quarter of 1993 (or so they say).  The upgrade from 2.0 to 3.0 is $100.00.  To purchase Imagine 2.0, it costs $495.00 or if you are upgrading from another eligible (call them for info) modeler, it is only $200.00 plus shipping & handling.   It requires a PC with 4 Megs a Math Coprocessor, and Dos 5.0 or up and a Microsoft Mouse and SVGA card.\n	Thanks for all your replies about the product.  I have received many contrasting replies, but once I scrounge the money together, I think I will take the plunge.  Thanks again.\n	Here is the info for Impulse if you want to find out more or get the sheet they sent.\n	Impulse Inc.\n	8416 Xerxes Avenue North\n	Minneapolis, MN 55444\n	1-800-328-0184\n\nThanks again for all your replies.\nScott\n-- \nScott Snowiss\nsasst11+@.pitt.edu

Douglas Adams once said (paraphrased from memory): "I just picked it.  It\nseemed like the sort of number you wouldn't be afraid to take home to meet\nyour parents.  Nice and even, perfectly normal."
Basically, there are two algorithms determining whether a point is inside,\noutside or on the polygon. The first one is Ray (or half line) method. In\nthis method, you can draw any ray, if the number of the intersection point\nof the ray and the polygon is even, then it is outside. If the number is odd,\nthen it is inside. Of cause, you have to deal with the special cases which\nmay make you headache.\n\nThe second method is PI algorithm. Draw the lines between the point and\nall the vertices on the polygon. Calculate and sum the angles of the\nsuccessive lines. If the result is 2*PI, then it is inside. If PI, then\nit is on the polygon. Otherwise it is outside.\n\nMy experience tells the second method is relible.\n\nHope this helps.

Our shop uses a package called CADCore - very good - to scan and\nsubsequently vectorize original maps into digital maps. The problem is that\nonce the raster file is loaded into the CADCore package, a header is added\nto the .HRF file which makes it unreadable by the supplied converter. We\nwould like to be able to ship some of the already-altered raster images for\nfurther use on our workstations. So, here are my questions:\n\n (1) What is the Hitachi format? - I need this format so I can recognize\nprecisely what to strip out. I strongly suspect that it's a compressed\nformat - if so, then t might not be possible for me to strip out the\noffending header.\n\n (2) Are there any UNIX packages that read and recognize HRF? It would be\nreally nice to find some sort of "hrftopbm" converter out there. ;)
Acorn Replay running on a 25MHz ARM 3 processor (the ARM 3 is about 20% slower\nthan the ARM 6) does this in software (off a standard CD-ROM). 16 bit colour at\nabout the same resolution (so what if the computer only has 8 bit colour\nsupport, real-time dithering too...). The 3D0/O is supposed to have a couple of\nDSPs - the ARM being used for housekeeping.\n\n\nA 25MHz ARM 6xx should clock around 20 ARM MIPS, say 18 flat out. Depends\nreally on the surrounding system and whether you are talking ARM6x or ARM6xx\n(the latter has a cache, and so is essential to run at this kind of speed with\nslower memory).\n\nI'll stop saying things there 'cos I'll hopefully be working for ARM after\ngraduation...\n\nMike\n\nPS Don't pay heed to what reps from Philips say; if the 3D0/O doesn't beat the\n   pants off 3DI then I'll eat this postscript.

I think he wanted to avoid reinventing the wheel.\nI would suggest that you take your code, and submit it to\ncomp.sys.mac.binaries to be distributed (including to the ftp sites). \nMany folks, myself included, would enjoy the extra code.\n\n\nJust to clarify, the 3D routines that are mentioned in various places\non the mac are in a libray, not the ROM of the mac.  A few years ago before\nI knew anything about implementing graphics, I came across a demo of the\nApple GrafSys3D library and it actually did a lot.  However, it is quite\nlimited in the sense that it's a low-level 3D library; your code still has\nto plot individual points, draw each line, etc ad nauseum.  It has nothing\non GL, for example, where you can handle objects.\n\nOther things to consider when talking about Apple's old 3D GrafSys library:\n\n* Unsupported;  never was and no plans exist to do so in the future\n\n* Undocumented; unless you call header files documentation...\n\nIf one knows something about graphics, you could probably figure it out,\nbut I'd assume there's better software available that gives better\noutput and is, at the same time, programmatically nicer (i.e. easier to\nprogram).\n\nJust my 2% tax
While I don't mean to damn Henrik's attempt to be helpful here,\nhe's using a common misconception that should be corrected.\n\n    Mach banding will occur for any image.  It is not the color\nquantization you see when you don't have enough bits.  It is the\nhuman eye's response to transitions or edges between intensities.\nThe result is that colors near the transistion look brighter on\nthe brighter side and darker on the darker side.\n\n--Andre

JPEG is designed for compressing either\nfull-color or gray-scale digital images of "natural", real-world scenes.\nIt does not work so well on non-realistic images, such as cartoons or line\ndrawings.\n\nJPEG does not handle black-and-white (1-bit-per-pixel) images, nor does it\nhandle motion picture compression.  Standards for compressing those types\nof images are being worked on by other committees, named JBIG and MPEG\nrespectively.\n\nJPEG is "lossy", meaning that the image you get out of decompression isn't\nquite identical to what you originally put in.  The algorithm achieves much\nof its compression by exploiting known limitations of the human eye, notably\nthe fact that small color details aren't perceived as well as small details\nof light-and-dark.  Thus, JPEG is intended for compressing images that will\nbe looked at by humans.  If you plan to machine-analyze your images, the\nsmall errors introduced by JPEG may be a problem for you, even if they are\ninvisible to the eye.\n\nA useful property of JPEG is that the degree of lossiness can be varied by\nadjusting compression parameters.  This means that the image maker can trade\noff file size against output image quality.  You can make *extremely* small\nfiles if you don't mind poor quality; this is useful for indexing image\narchives, making thumbnail views or icons, etc. etc.  Conversely, if you\naren't happy with the output quality at the default compression setting, you\ncan jack up the quality until you are satisfied, and accept lesser compression.\n\n\n[2]  Why use JPEG?\n\nThere are two good reasons: to make your image files smaller, and to store\n24-bit-per-pixel color data instead of 8-bit-per-pixel data.\n\nMaking image files smaller is a big win for transmitting files across\nnetworks and for archiving libraries of images.  Being able to compress a\n2 Mbyte full-color file down to 100 Kbytes or so makes a big difference in\ndisk space and transmission time!  (If you are comparing GIF and JPEG, the\nsize ratio is more like four to one.  More details below.)\n\nIf your viewing software doesn't support JPEG directly, you'll have to\nconvert JPEG to some other format for viewing or manipulating images.  Even\nwith a JPEG-capable viewer, it takes longer to decode and view a JPEG image\nthan to view an image of a simpler format (GIF, for instance).  Thus, using\nJPEG is essentially a time/space tradeoff: you give up some time in order to\nstore or transmit an image more cheaply.\n\nIt's worth noting that when network or phone transmission is involved, the\ntime savings from transferring a shorter file can be much greater than the\nextra time to decompress the file.  I'll let you do the arithmetic yourself.\n\nThe other reason why JPEG will gradually replace GIF as a standard Usenet\nposting format is that JPEG can store full color information: 24 bits/pixel\n(16 million colors) instead of 8 or less (256 or fewer colors).  If you have\nonly 8-bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantage\nto you.  Within a couple of years, though, 8-bit GIF will look as obsolete as\nblack-and-white MacPaint format does today.  Furthermore, for reasons detailed\nin section 7, JPEG is far more useful than GIF for exchanging images among\npeople with widely varying color display hardware.  Hence JPEG is considerably\nmore appropriate than GIF for use as a Usenet posting standard.\n\n\n[3]  When should I use JPEG, and when should I stick with GIF?\n\nJPEG is *not* going to displace GIF entirely; for some types of images,\nGIF is superior in image quality, file size, or both.  One of the first\nthings to learn about JPEG is which kinds of images to apply it to.\n\nAs a rule of thumb, JPEG is superior to GIF for storing full-color or\ngray-scale images of "realistic" scenes; that means scanned photographs and\nsimilar material.  JPEG is superior even if you don't have 24-bit display\nhardware, and it is a LOT superior if you do.  (See section 7 for details.)\n\nGIF does significantly better on images with only a few distinct colors,\nsuch as cartoons and line drawings.  In particular, large areas of pixels\nthat are all *exactly* the same color are compressed very efficiently indeed\nby GIF.  JPEG can't squeeze these files as much as GIF does without\nintroducing visible defects.  This sort of image is best kept in GIF form.\n(In particular, single-color borders are quite cheap in GIF files, but they\nshould be avoided in JPEG files.)\n\nJPEG also has a hard time with very sharp edges: a row of pure-black pixels\nadjacent to a row of pure-white pixels, for example.  Sharp edges tend to\ncome out blurred unless you use a very high quality setting.  Again, this\nsort of thing is not found in scanned photographs, but it shows up fairly\noften in GIF files: borders, overlaid text, etc.  The blurriness is\nparticularly objectionable with text that's only a few pixels high.\nIf you have a GIF with a lot of small-size overlaid text, don't JPEG it.\n\nComputer-drawn images (ray-traced scenes, for instance) usually fall between\nscanned images and cartoons in terms of complexity.  The more complex and\nsubtly rendered the image, the more likely that JPEG will do well on it.\nThe same goes for semi-realistic artwork (fantasy drawings and such).\n\nPlain black-and-white (two level) images should never be converted to JPEG.\nYou need at least about 16 gray levels before JPEG is useful for gray-scale\nimages.  It should also be noted that GIF is lossless for gray-scale images\nof up to 256 levels, while JPEG is not.\n\nIf you have an existing library of GIF images, you may wonder whether you\nshould convert them to JPEG.  You will lose a little image quality if you do.\n(Section 7, which argues that JPEG image quality is superior to GIF, only\napplies if both formats start from a full-color original.  If you start from\na GIF, you've already irretrievably lost a great deal of information; JPEG\ncan only make things worse.)  However, the disk space savings may justify\nconverting anyway.  This is a decision you'll have to make for yourself.\nIf you do convert a GIF library to JPEG, see section 14 for hints.  Be\nprepared to leave some images in GIF format, since some GIFs will not\nconvert well.\n\n\n[4]  How well does JPEG compress images?\n\nPretty darn well.  Here are some sample file sizes for an image I have\nhandy, a 727x525 full-color image of a ship in a harbor.  The first three\nfiles are for comparison purposes; the rest were created with the free JPEG\nsoftware described in section 6B.\n\nFile	   Size in bytes		Comments\n\nship.ppm	1145040  Original file in PPM format (no compression; 24 bits\n			 or 3 bytes per pixel, plus a few bytes overhead)\nship.ppm.Z	 963829  PPM file passed through Unix compress\n			 compress doesn't accomplish a lot, you'll note.\n			 Other text-oriented compressors give similar results.\nship.gif	 240438  Converted to GIF with ppmquant -fs 256 | ppmtogif\n			 Most of the savings is the result of losing color\n			 info: GIF saves 8 bits/pixel, not 24.  (See sec. 7.)\n\nship.jpg95	 155622  cjpeg -Q 95    (highest useful quality setting)\n			 This is indistinguishable from the 24-bit original,\n			 at least to my nonprofessional eyeballs.\nship.jpg75	  58009  cjpeg -Q 75    (default setting)\n			 You have to look mighty darn close to distinguish this\n			 from the original, even with both on-screen at once.\nship.jpg50	  38406  cjpeg -Q 50\n			 This has slight defects; if you know what to look\n			 for, you could tell it's been JPEGed without seeing\n			 the original.  Still as good image quality as many\n			 recent postings in Usenet pictures groups.\nship.jpg25	  25192  cjpeg -Q 25\n			 JPEG's characteristic "blockiness" becomes apparent\n			 at this setting (djpeg -blocksmooth helps some).\n			 Still, I've seen plenty of Usenet postings that were\n			 of poorer image quality than this.\nship.jpg5o	   6587  cjpeg -Q 5 -optimize  (-optimize cuts table overhead)\n			 Blocky, but perfectly satisfactory for preview or\n			 indexing purposes.  Note that this file is TINY:\n			 the compression ratio from the original is 173:1 !\n\nIn this case JPEG can make a file that's a factor of four or five smaller\nthan a GIF of comparable quality (the -Q 75 file is every bit as good as the\nGIF, better if you have a full-color display).  This seems to be a typical\nratio for real-world scenes.\n\n\n[5]  What are good "quality" settings for JPEG?\n\nMost JPEG compressors let you pick a file size vs. image quality tradeoff by\nselecting a quality setting.  There seems to be widespread confusion about\nthe meaning of these settings.  "Quality 95" does NOT mean "keep 95% of the\ninformation", as some have claimed.  The quality scale is purely arbitrary;\nit's not a percentage of anything.\n\nThe name of the game in using JPEG is to pick the lowest quality setting\n(smallest file size) that decompresses into an image indistinguishable from\nthe original.  This setting will vary from one image to another and from one\nobserver to another, but here are some rules of thumb.\n\nThe default quality setting (-Q 75) is very often the best choice.  This\nsetting is about the lowest you can go without expecting to see defects in a\ntypical image.  Try -Q 75 first; if you see defects, then go up.  Except for\nexperimental purposes, never go above -Q 95; saying -Q 100 will produce a\nfile two or three times as large as -Q 95, but of hardly any better quality.\n\nIf the image was less than perfect quality to begin with, you might be able to\ngo down to -Q 50 without objectionable degradation.  On the other hand, you\nmight need to go to a HIGHER quality setting to avoid further degradation.\nThe second case seems to apply much of the time when converting GIFs to JPEG.\nThe default -Q 75 is about right for compressing 24-bit images, but -Q 85 to\n95 is usually better for converting GIFs (see section 14 for more info).\n\nIf you want a very small file (say for preview or indexing purposes) and are\nprepared to tolerate large defects, a -Q setting in the range of 5 to 10 is\nabout right.  -Q 2 or so may be amusing as "op art".\n\n(Note: the quality settings discussed in this article apply to the free JPEG\nsoftware described in section 6B, and to many programs based on it.  Other\nJPEG implementations, such as Image Alchemy, may use a completely different\nquality scale.  Some programs don't even provide a numeric scale, just\n"high"/"medium"/"low"-style choices.)\n\n\n[6]  Where can I get JPEG software?\n\nMost of the programs described in this section are available by FTP.\nIf you don't know how to use FTP, see the FAQ article "How to find sources".\n(If you don't have direct access to FTP, read about ftpmail servers in the\nsame article.)  That article appears regularly in news.answers, or you can\nget it by sending e-mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with\n"send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources" in the body.  The "Anonymous FTP\nList FAQ" may also be helpful --- it's usenet/news.answers/ftp-list/faq in\nthe news.answers archive.\n\nNOTE: this list changes constantly.  If you have a copy more than a couple\nmonths old, get the latest JPEG FAQ from the news.answers archive.\n\n\n[6A]  If you are looking for "canned" software, viewers, etc:\n\nThe first part of this list is system-specific programs that only run on one\nkind of system.  If you don't see what you want for your machine, check out\nthe portable JPEG software described at the end of the list.  Note that this\nlist concentrates on free and shareware programs that you can obtain over\nInternet; but some commercial programs are listed too.\n\nX Windows:\n\nJohn Bradley's free XV (version 2.00 and up) is an excellent viewer for JPEG,\nGIF, and other image formats.  It's available for FTP from export.lcs.mit.edu\nor ftp.cis.upenn.edu.  The file is called 'xv-???.tar.Z' (where ??? is the\nversion number, currently 2.21); it is located in the 'contrib' directory on\nexport or the 'pub/xv' directory at upenn.  XV reduces all images to 8 bits\ninternally, which means it's not a real good choice if you have a 24-bit\ndisplay (you'll still get only 8-bit color).  Also, you shouldn't use XV to\nconvert full-color images to JPEG, because they'll get color-quantized first.\nBut XV is a fine tool for converting GIF and other 8-bit images to JPEG.\nCAUTION: there is a glitch in versions 2.21 and earlier: be sure to check\nthe "save at normal size" checkbox when saving a JPEG file, or the file will\nbe blurry.\n\nAnother good choice for X Windows is John Cristy's free ImageMagick package,\nalso available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z.\nThis package handles many image processing and conversion tasks.  The\nImageMagick viewer handles 24-bit displays correctly; for colormapped\ndisplays, it does better (though slower) color quantization than XV or the\nbasic free JPEG software.\n\nBoth of the above are large, complex packages.  If you just want a simple\nimage viewer, try xloadimage or xli.  xloadimage supports JPEG in its latest\nrelease, 3.03.  xloadimage is free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu,\nfile contrib/xloadimage.3.03.tar.Z.  xli is a variant version of xloadimage,\nsaid by its fans to be somewhat faster and more robust than the original.\n(The current xli is indeed faster and more robust than the current\nxloadimage, at least with respect to JPEG files, because it has the IJG v4\ndecoder while xloadimage 3.03 is using a hacked-over v1.  The next\nxloadimage release will fix this.)  xli is also free and available from\nexport.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/xli.1.14.tar.Z.  Both programs are said\nto do the right thing with 24-bit displays.\n\n\nMS-DOS:\n\nThis covers plain DOS; for Windows or OS/2 programs, see the next headings.\n\nOne good choice is Eric Praetzel's free DVPEG, which views JPEG and GIF files.\nThe current version, 2.4a, is available by FTP from sunee.uwaterloo.ca\n(129.97.50.50), file pub/jpeg/viewers/dvpeg24a.zip.  This is a good basic\nviewer that works on either 286 or 386/486 machines.  The user interface is\nnot flashy, but it's functional.\n\nAnother freeware JPEG/GIF/TGA viewer is Mohammad Rezaei's Hiview.  The\ncurrent version, 1.2, is available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE\nbelow), file msdos/graphics/hv12.zip.  Hiview requires a 386 or better CPU\nand a VCPI-compatible memory manager (QEMM386 and 386MAX work; Windows and\nOS/2 do not).  Hiview is currently the fastest viewer for images that are no\nbigger than your screen.  For larger images, it scales the image down to fit\non the screen (rather than using panning/scrolling as most viewers do).\nYou may or may not prefer this approach, but there's no denying that it\nslows down loading of large images considerably.  Note: installation is a\nbit tricky; read the directions carefully!\n\nA shareware alternative is ColorView for DOS ($30).  This is easier to\ninstall than either of the two freeware alternatives.  Its user interface is\nalso much spiffier-looking, although personally I find it harder to use ---\nmore keystrokes, inconsistent behavior.  It is faster than DVPEG but a\nlittle slower than Hiview, at least on my hardware.  (For images larger than\nscreen size, DVPEG and ColorView seem to be about the same speed, and both\nare faster than Hiview.)  The current version is 2.1, available from\nSimtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/dcview21.zip.\nRequires a VESA graphics driver; if you don't have one, look in vesadrv2.zip\nor vesa-tsr.zip from the same directory.  (Many recent PCs have a built-in\nVESA driver, so don't try to load a VESA driver unless ColorView complains\nthat the driver is missing.)\n\nA second shareware alternative is Fullview, which has been kicking around\nthe net for a while, but I don't know any stable archive location for it.\nThe current (rather old) version is inferior to the above viewers anyway.\nThe author tells me that a new version of Fullview will be out shortly\nand it will be submitted to the Simtel20 archives at that time.\n\nThe well-known GIF viewer CompuShow (CSHOW) supports JPEG in its latest\nrevision, 8.60a.  However, CSHOW's JPEG implementation isn't very good:\nit's slow (about half the speed of the above viewers) and image quality is\npoor except on hi-color displays.  Too bad ... it'd have been nice to see a\ngood JPEG capability in CSHOW.  Shareware, $25.  Available from Simtel20 and\nmirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/gif/cshw860a.zip.\n\nDue to the remarkable variety of PC graphics hardware, any one of these\nviewers might not work on your particular machine.  If you can't get *any*\nof them to work, you'll need to use one of the following conversion programs\nto convert JPEG to GIF, then view with your favorite GIF viewer.  (If you\nhave hi-color hardware, don't use GIF as the intermediate format; try to\nfind a TARGA-capable viewer instead.  VPIC5.0 is reputed to do the right\nthing with hi-color displays.)\n\nThe Independent JPEG Group's free JPEG converters are FTPable from Simtel20\nand mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/jpeg4.zip (or\njpeg4386.zip if you have a 386 and extended memory).  These files are DOS\ncompilations of the free source code described in section 6B; they will\nconvert JPEG to and from GIF, Targa, and PPM formats.\n\nHandmade Software offers free JPEG<=>GIF conversion tools, GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF.\nThese are slow and are limited to conversion to and from GIF format; in\nparticular, you can't get 24-bit color output from a JPEG.  The major\nadvantage of these tools is that they will read and write HSI's proprietary\nJPEG format as well as the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Since HSI-format\nfiles are rather widespread on BBSes, this is a useful capability.  Version\n2.0 of these tools is free (prior versions were shareware).  Get it from\nSimtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/gif2jpg2.zip.\nNOTE: do not use HSI format for files to be posted on Internet, since it is\nnot readable on non-PC platforms.\n\nHandmade Software also has a shareware image conversion and manipulation\npackage, Image Alchemy.  This will translate JPEG files (both JFIF and HSI\nformats) to and from many other image formats.  It can also display images.\nA demo version of Image Alchemy version 1.6.1 is available from Simtel20 and\nmirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/alch161.zip.\n\nNOTE ABOUT SIMTEL20: The Internet's key archive site for PC-related programs\nis Simtel20, full name wsmr-simtel20.army.mil (192.88.110.20).  Simtel20\nruns a non-Unix system with weird directory names; where this document\nrefers to directory (eg) "msdos/graphics" at Simtel20, that really means\n"pd1:<msdos.graphics>".  If you are not physically on MILnet, you should\nexpect rather slow FTP transfer rates from Simtel20.  There are several\nInternet sites that maintain copies (mirrors) of the Simtel20 archives;\nmost FTP users should go to one of the mirror sites instead.  A popular USA\nmirror site is oak.oakland.edu (141.210.10.117), which keeps Simtel20 files\nin (eg) "/pub/msdos/graphics".  If you have no FTP capability, you can\nretrieve files from Simtel20 by e-mail; see informational postings in\ncomp.archives.msdos.announce to find out how.  If you are outside the USA,\nconsult the same newsgroup to learn where your nearest Simtel20 mirror is.\n\nMicrosoft Windows:\n\nThere are several Windows programs capable of displaying JPEG images.\n(Windows viewers are generally slower than DOS viewers on the same hardware,\ndue to Windows' system overhead.  Note that you can run the DOS conversion\nprograms described above inside a Windows DOS window.)\n\nThe newest entry is WinECJ, which is free and EXTREMELY fast.  Version 1.0\nis available from ftp.rahul.net, file /pub/bryanw/pc/jpeg/wecj.zip.\nRequires Windows 3.1 and 256-or-more-colors mode.  This is a no-frills\nviewer with the bad habit of hogging the machine completely while it\ndecodes; and the image quality is noticeably worse than other viewers.\nBut it's so fast you'll use it anyway, at least for previewing...\n\nJView is freeware, fairly fast, has good on-line help, and can write out the\ndecompressed image in Windows BMP format; but it can't create new JPEG\nfiles, and it doesn't view GIFs.  JView also lacks some other useful\nfeatures of the shareware viewers (such as brightness adjustment), but it's\nan excellent basic viewer.  The current version, 0.9, is available from\nftp.cica.indiana.edu (129.79.20.84), file pub/pc/win3/desktop/jview090.zip.\n(Mirrors of this archive can be found at some other Internet sites,\nincluding wuarchive.wustl.edu.)\n\nWinJPEG (shareware, $20) displays JPEG,GIF,Targa,TIFF, and BMP image files;\nit can write all of these formats too, so it can be used as a converter.\nIt has some other nifty features including color-balance adjustment and\nslideshow.  The current version is 2.1, available from Simtel20 and mirror\nsites (see NOTE above), file msdos/windows3/winjp210.zip.  (This is a slow\n286-compatible version; if you register, you'll get the 386-only version,\nwhich is roughly 25% faster.)\n\nColorView is another shareware entry ($30).  This was an early and promising\ncontender, but it has not been updated in some time, and at this point it\nhas no real advantages over WinJPEG.  If you want to try it anyway, the\ncurrent version is 0.97, available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu, file\npub/pc/win3/desktop/cview097.zip.  (I understand that a new version will\nbe appearing once the authors are finished with ColorView for DOS.)\n\nDVPEG (see DOS heading) also works under Windows, but only in full-screen\nmode, not in a window.\n\nOS/2:\n\nThe following files are available from hobbes.nmsu.edu (128.123.35.151).\nNote: check /pub/uploads for more recent versions --- the hobbes moderator\nis not very fast about moving uploads into their permanent directories.\n/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/jpegv4.zip\n    32-bit version of free IJG conversion programs, version 4.\n/pub/os2/all/graphics/jpeg4-16.zip\n    16-bit version of same, for OS/2 1.x.\n/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/imgarc11.zip\n    Image Archiver 1.01: image conversion/viewing with PM graphical interface.\n    Strong on conversion functions, viewing is a bit weaker.  Shareware, $15.\n/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmjpeg11.zip\n    PMJPEG 1.1: OS/2 2.x port of WinJPEG, a popular viewer for Windows\n    (see description in Windows section).  Shareware, $20.\n/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmview84.zip\n    PMView 0.84: JPEG/GIF/BMP viewer.  GIF viewing very fast, JPEG viewing\n    fast if you have huge amounts of RAM, otherwise about the same speed\n    as the above programs.  Strong 24-bit display support.  Shareware, $20.\n\nMacintosh:\n\nMost Mac JPEG programs rely on Apple's JPEG implementation, which is part of\nthe QuickTime system extension; so you need to have QuickTime installed.\nTo use QuickTime, you need a 68020 or better CPU and you need to be running\nSystem 6.0.7 or later.  (If you're running System 6, you must also install\nthe 32-bit QuickDraw extension; this is built-in on System 7.)  You can get\nQuickTime by FTP from ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/quicktime.hqx.\n(As of 11/92, this file contains QuickTime 1.5, which is better than QT 1.0\nin several ways.  With respect to JPEG, it is marginally faster and\nconsiderably less prone to crash when fed a corrupt JPEG file.  However,\nsome applications seem to have compatibility problems with QT 1.5.)\n\nMac users should keep in mind that QuickTime's JPEG format, PICT/JPEG, is\nnot the same as the Usenet-standard JFIF JPEG format.  (See section 10 for\ndetails.)  If you post images on Usenet, make sure they are in JFIF format.\nMost of the programs mentioned below can generate either format.\n\nThe first choice is probably JPEGView, a free program for viewing images\nthat are in JFIF format, PICT/JPEG format, or GIF format.  It also can\nconvert between the two JPEG formats.  The current version, 2.0, is a big\nimprovement over prior versions.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu\n(36.44.0.6), file /info-mac/app/jpeg-view-20.hqx.  Requires System 7 and\nQuickTime.  On 8-bit displays, JPEGView usually produces the best color\nimage quality of all the currently available Mac JPEG viewers.  JPEGView can\nview large images in much less memory than other Mac viewers; in fact, it's\nthe only one that can deal with JPEG images much over 640x480 pixels on a\ntypical 4MB Mac.  Given a large image, JPEGView automatically scales it down\nto fit on the screen, rather than presenting scroll bars like most other\nviewers.  (You can zoom in on any desired portion, though.)  Some people\nlike this behavior, some don't.  Overall, JPEGView's user interface is very\nwell thought out.\n\nGIFConverter, a shareware ($40) image viewer/converter, supports JFIF and\nPICT/JPEG, as well as GIF and several other image formats.  The latest\nversion is 2.3.2.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file\n/info-mac/art/gif/gif-converter-232.hqx.  Requires System 6.0.5 or later.\nGIFConverter is not better than JPEGView as a plain JPEG/GIF viewer, but\nit has much more extensive image manipulation and format conversion\ncapabilities, so you may find it worth its shareware fee if you do a lot of\nplaying around with images.  Also, the newest version of GIFConverter can\nload and save JFIF images *without* QuickTime, so it is your best bet if\nyour machine is too old to run QuickTime.  (But it's faster with QuickTime.)\nNote: If GIFConverter runs out of memory trying to load a large JPEG, try\nconverting the file to GIF with JPEG Convert, then viewing the GIF version.\n\nJPEG Convert, a Mac version of the free IJG JPEG conversion utilities, is\navailable from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/app/jpeg-convert-10.hqx.\nThis will run on any Mac, but it only does file conversion, not viewing.\nYou can use it in conjunction with any GIF viewer.\n\nPrevious versions of this FAQ recommended Imagery JPEG v0.6, a JPEG<=>GIF\nconverter based on an old version of the IJG code.  If you are using this\nprogram, you definitely should replace it with JPEG Convert.\n\nApple's free program PictPixie can view images in JFIF, QuickTime JPEG, and\nGIF format, and can convert between these formats.  You can get PictPixie\nfrom ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/qt.1.0.stuff/pictpixie.hqx.\nRequires QuickTime.  PictPixie was intended as a developer's tool, and it's\nreally not the best choice unless you like to fool around with QuickTime.\nSome of its drawbacks are that it requires lots of memory, it produces\nrelatively poor color image quality on anything less than a 24-bit display,\nand it has a relatively unfriendly user interface.  Worse, PictPixie is an\nunsupported program, meaning it has some minor bugs that Apple does not\nintend to fix.  (There is an old version of PictPixie, called\nPICTCompressor, floating around the net.  If you have this you should trash\nit, as it's even buggier.  Also, the QuickTime Starter Kit includes a much\ncleaned-up descendant of PictPixie called Picture Compressor.  Note that\nPicture Compressor is NOT free and may not be distributed on the net.)\n\nStorm Technology's Picture Decompress is a free JPEG viewer/converter.\nThis rather old program is inferior to the above programs in many ways, but\nit will run without System 7 or QuickTime, so you may be forced to use it on\nolder systems.  (It does need 32-bit QuickDraw, so really old machines can't\nuse it.)  You can get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file\n/info-mac/app/picture-decompress-201.hqx.  You must set the file type of a\ndownloaded image file to 'JPEG' to allow Picture Decompress to open it.\n\nIf your machine is too old to run 32-bit QuickDraw (a Mac Plus for instance),\nGIFConverter is your only choice for single-program JPEG viewing.  If you\ndon't want to pay for GIFConverter, use JPEG Convert and a free GIF viewer.\n\nMore and more commercial Mac applications are supporting JPEG, although not\nall can deal with the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Adobe Photoshop, version\n2.0.1 or later, can read and write JFIF-format JPEG files (use the JPEG\nplug-in from the Acquire menu).  You must set the file type of a downloaded\nJPEG file to 'JPEG' to allow Photoshop to recognize it.\n\nAmiga:\n\n(Most programs listed in this section are stored in the AmiNet archive at\namiga.physik.unizh.ch (130.60.80.80).  There are many mirror sites of this\narchive and you should try to use the closest one.  In the USA, a good\nchoice is wuarchive.wustl.edu; look under /mirrors/amiga.physik.unizh.ch/...)\n\nHamLab Plus is an excellent JPEG viewer/converter, as well as being a\ngeneral image manipulation tool.  It's cheap (shareware, $20) and can read\nseveral formats besides JPEG.  The current version is 2.0.8.  A demo version\nis available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file\namiga/gfx/edit/hamlab208d.lha.  The demo version will crop images larger\nthan 512x512, but it is otherwise fully functional.\n\nRend24 (shareware, $30) is an image renderer that can display JPEG, ILBM,\nand GIF images.  The program can be used to create animations, even\ncapturing frames on-the-fly from rendering packages like Lightwave.  The\ncurrent version is 1.05, available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror\nsites), file amiga/os30/gfx/rend105.lha.  (Note: although this directory is\nsupposedly for AmigaDOS 3.0 programs, the program will also run under\nAmigaDOS 1.3, 2.04 or 2.1.)\n\nViewtek is a free JPEG/ILBM/GIF/ANIM viewer.  The current version is 1.04,\navailable from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file\namiga/gfx/show/ViewTek104.lha.\n\nIf you're willing to spend real money, there are several commercial packages\nthat support JPEG.  Two are written by Thomas Krehbiel, the author of Rend24\nand Viewtek.  These are CineMorph, a standalone image morphing package, and\nImageFX, an impressive 24-bit image capture, conversion, editing, painting,\neffects and prepress package that also includes CineMorph.  Both are\ndistributed by Great Valley Products.  Art Department Professional (ADPro),\nfrom ASDG Inc, is the most widely used commercial image manipulation\nsoftware for Amigas.  ImageMaster, from Black Belt Systems, is another\nwell-regarded commercial graphics package with JPEG support.\n\nThe free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Amigas from\namiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites) in directory amiga/gfx/conv, file\nAmigaJPEGV4.lha.  These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM,GIF,Targa formats.\n\nThe Amiga world is heavily infested with quick-and-dirty JPEG programs, many\nbased on an ancient beta-test version of the free IJG JPEG software (thanks\nto a certain magazine that published same on its disk-of-the-month, without\nso much as notifying the authors).  Among these are "AugJPEG", "NewAmyJPEG",\n"VJPEG", and probably others I have not even heard of.  In my opinion,\nanything older than IJG version 3 (March 1992) is not worth the disk space\nit's stored on; if you have such a program, trash it and get something newer.\n\nAtari ST:\n\nThe free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Atari ST, TT, etc,\nfrom atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/Graphics/jpeg4bin.zoo.\nThese programs convert JPEG to/from PPM, GIF, Targa formats.\n\nI have not heard of any free or shareware JPEG-capable viewer for Ataris,\nbut surely there must be one by now?  Pointers appreciated.\n\nAcorn Archimedes:\n\n!ChangeFSI, supplied with RISC OS 3 version 3.10, can convert from and view\nJPEG JFIF format.  Provision is also made to convert images to JPEG,\nalthough this must be done from the CLI rather than by double-clicking.\n\nRecent versions (since 7.11) of the shareware program Translator can handle\nJPEG, along with about 30 other image formats.  While older versions can be\nfound on some Archimedes bboards, the current version is only available by\nregistering with the author, John Kortink, Nutterbrink 31, 7544 WJ, Enschede,\nThe Netherlands.  Price 35 Dutch guilders (about $22 or 10 pounds).\n\nThere's also a commercial product called !JPEG which provides JPEG read/write\nfunctionality and direct JPEG viewing, as well as a host of other image\nformat conversion and processing options.  This is more expensive but not\nnecessarily better than the above programs.  Contact: DT Software, FREEPOST,\nCambridge, UK.  Tel: 0223 841099.\n\n\nPortable software for almost any system:\n\nIf none of the above fits your situation, you can obtain and compile the free\nJPEG conversion software described in 6B.  You'll also need a viewer program.\nIf your display is 8 bits or less, any GIF viewer will do fine; if you have a\ndisplay with more color capability, try to find a viewer that can read Targa\nor PPM 24-bit image files.\n\nThere are numerous commercial JPEG offerings, with more popping up every\nday.  I recommend that you not spend money on one of these unless you find\nthe available free or shareware software vastly too slow.  In that case,\npurchase a hardware-assisted product.  Ask pointed questions about whether\nthe product complies with the final JPEG standard and about whether it can\nhandle the JFIF file format; many of the earliest commercial releases are\nnot and never will be compatible with anyone else's files.\n\n\n[6B]  If you are looking for source code to work with:\n\nFree, portable C code for JPEG compression is available from the Independent\nJPEG Group, which I lead.  A package containing our source code,\ndocumentation, and some small test files is available from several places.\nThe "official" archive site for this source code is ftp.uu.net (137.39.1.9\nor 192.48.96.9).  Look under directory /graphics/jpeg; the current release\nis jpegsrc.v4.tar.Z.  (This is a compressed TAR file; don't forget to\nretrieve in binary mode.)  You can retrieve this file by FTP or UUCP.\nIf you are on a PC and don't know how to cope with .tar.Z format, you may\nprefer ZIP format, which you can find at Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE\nabove), file msdos/graphics/jpegsrc4.zip.  This file will also be available on\nCompuServe, in the GRAPHSUPPORT forum (GO PICS), library 15, as jpsrc4.zip.\nIf you have no FTP access, you can retrieve the source from your nearest\ncomp.sources.misc archive; version 4 appeared as issues 55-72 of volume 34.\n(If you don't know how to retrieve comp.sources.misc postings, see the FAQ\narticle "How to find sources", referred to at the top of section 6.)\n\nThe free JPEG code provides conversion between JPEG "JFIF" format and image\nfiles in GIF, PBMPLUS PPM/PGM, Utah RLE, and Truevision Targa file formats.\nThe core compression and decompression modules can easily be reused in other\nprograms, such as image viewers.  The package is highly portable; we have\ntested it on many machines ranging from PCs to Crays.\n\nWe have released this software for both noncommercial and commercial use.\nCompanies are welcome to use it as the basis for JPEG-related products.\nWe do not ask a royalty, although we do ask for an acknowledgement in\nproduct literature (see the README file in the distribution for details).\nWe hope to make this software industrial-quality --- although, as with\nanything that's free, we offer no warranty and accept no liability.\n\nThe Independent JPEG Group is a volunteer organization; if you'd like to\ncontribute to improving our software, you are welcome to join.\n\n\n[7]  What's all this hoopla about color quantization?\n\nMost people don't have full-color (24 bit per pixel) display hardware.\nTypical display hardware stores 8 or fewer bits per pixel, so it can display\n256 or fewer distinct colors at a time.  To display a full-color image, the\ncomputer must map the image into an appropriate set of representative\ncolors.  This process is called "color quantization".  (This is something\nof a misnomer, "color selection" would be a better term.  We're stuck with\nthe standard usage though.)\n\nClearly, color quantization is a lossy process.  It turns out that for most\nimages, the details of the color quantization algorithm have MUCH more impact\non the final image quality than do any errors introduced by JPEG (except at\nthe very lowest JPEG quality settings).\n\nSince JPEG is a full-color format, converting a color JPEG image for display\non 8-bit-or-less hardware requires color quantization.  This is true for\n*all* color JPEGs: even if you feed a 256-or-less-color GIF into JPEG, what\ncomes out of the decompressor is *not* 256 colors, but thousands of colors.\nThis happens because JPEG's lossiness affects each pixel a little\ndifferently, so two pixels that started with identical colors will probably\ncome out with slightly different colors.  Each original color gets "smeared"\ninto a group of nearby colors.  Therefore quantization is always required to\ndisplay a color JPEG on a colormapped display, regardless of the image\nsource.  The only way to avoid quantization is to ask for gray-scale output.\n\n(Incidentally, because of this effect it's nearly meaningless to talk about\nthe number of colors used by a JPEG image.  Even if you attempted to count\nthe number of distinct pixel values, different JPEG decoders would give you\ndifferent results because of roundoff error differences.  I occasionally see\nposted images described as "256-color JPEG".  This tells me that the poster\n(a) hasn't read this FAQ and (b) probably converted the JPEG from a GIF.\nJPEGs can be classified as color or gray-scale (just like photographs), but\nnumber of colors just isn't a useful concept for JPEG.)\n\nOn the other hand, a GIF image by definition has already been quantized to\n256 or fewer colors.  (A GIF *does* have a definite number of colors in its\npalette, and the format doesn't allow more than 256 palette entries.)\nFor purposes of Usenet picture distribution, GIF has the advantage that the\nsender precomputes the color quantization, so recipients don't have to.\nThis is also the *disadvantage* of GIF: you're stuck with the sender's\nquantization.  If the sender quantized to a different number of colors than\nwhat you can display, you have to re-quantize, resulting in much poorer\nimage quality than if you had quantized once from a full-color image.\nFurthermore, if the sender didn't use a high-quality color quantization\nalgorithm, you're out of luck.\n\nFor this reason, JPEG offers the promise of significantly better image quality\nfor all users whose machines don't match the sender's display hardware.\nJPEG's full color image can be quantized to precisely match the user's display\nhardware.  Furthermore, you will be able to take advantage of future\nimprovements in quantization algorithms (there is a lot of active research in\nthis area), or purchase better display hardware, to get a better view of JPEG\nimages you already have.  With a GIF, you're stuck forevermore with what was\nsent.\n\nIt's also worth mentioning that many GIF-viewing programs include rather\nshoddy quantization routines.  If you view a 256-color GIF on a 16-color EGA\ndisplay, for example, you are probably getting a much worse image than you\nneed to.  This is partly an inevitable consequence of doing two color\nquantizations (one to create the GIF, one to display it), but often it's\nalso due to sloppiness.  JPEG conversion programs will be forced to use\nhigh quality quantizers in order to get acceptable results at all, and in\nnormal use they will quantize directly to the number of colors to be\ndisplayed.  Thus, JPEG is likely to provide better results than the average\nGIF program for low-color-resolution displays as well as high-resolution ones!\n\nFinally, an ever-growing number of people have better-than-8-bit display\nhardware already: 15-bit "hi-color" PC displays, true 24-bit displays on\nworkstations and Macintoshes, etc.  For these people, GIF is already\nobsolete, as it cannot represent an image to the full capabilities of their\ndisplay.  JPEG images can drive these displays much more effectively.\nThus, JPEG is an all-around better choice than GIF for representing images\nin a machine-independent fashion.\n\n\n[8]  How does JPEG work?\n\nThe buzz-words to know are chrominance subsampling, discrete cosine\ntransforms, coefficient quantization, and Huffman or arithmetic entropy\ncoding.  This article's long enough already, so I'm not going to say more\nthan that here.  For technical information, see the comp.compression FAQ.\nThis is available from the news.answers archive at rtfm.mit.edu, in files\n/pub/usenet/news.answers/compression-faq/part[1-3].  If you need help in\nusing the news.answers archive, see the top of this article.\n\n\n[9]  What about lossless JPEG?\n\nThere's a great deal of confusion on this subject.  The JPEG committee did\ndefine a truly lossless compression algorithm, i.e., one that guarantees the\nfinal output is bit-for-bit identical to the original input.  However, this\nlossless mode has almost nothing in common with the regular, lossy JPEG\nalgorithm, and it offers much less compression.  At present, very few\nimplementations of lossless JPEG exist, and all of them are commercial.\n\nSaying "-Q 100" to the free JPEG software DOES NOT get you a lossless image.\nWhat it does get rid of is deliberate information loss in the coefficient\nquantization step.  There is still a good deal of information loss in the\ncolor subsampling step.  (With the V4 free JPEG code, you can also say\n"-sample 1x1" to turn off subsampling.  Keep in mind that many commercial\nJPEG implementations cannot cope with the resulting file.)\n\nEven with both quantization and subsampling turned off, the regular JPEG\nalgorithm is not lossless, because it is subject to roundoff errors in\nvarious calculations.  The maximum error is a few counts in any one pixel\nvalue; it's highly unlikely that this could be perceived by the human eye,\nbut it might be a concern if you are doing machine processing of an image.\n\nAt this minimum-loss setting, regular JPEG produces files that are perhaps\nhalf the size of an uncompressed 24-bit-per-pixel image.  True lossless JPEG\nprovides roughly the same amount of compression, but it guarantees\nbit-for-bit accuracy.\n\nIf you have an application requiring lossless storage of images with less\nthan 6 bits per pixel (per color component), you may want to look into the\nJBIG bilevel image compression standard.  This performs better than JPEG\nlossless on such images.  JPEG lossless is superior to JBIG on images with\n6 or more bits per pixel; furthermore, JPEG is public domain (at least with a\nHuffman back end), while the JBIG techniques are heavily covered by patents.\n\n\n[10]  Why all the argument about file formats?\n\nStrictly speaking, JPEG refers only to a family of compression algorithms;\nit does *not* refer to a specific image file format.  The JPEG committee was\nprevented from defining a file format by turf wars within the international\nstandards organizations.\n\nSince we can't actually exchange images with anyone else unless we agree on\na common file format, this leaves us with a problem.  In the absence of\nofficial standards, a number of JPEG program writers have just gone off to\n"do their own thing", and as a result their programs aren't compatible with\nanybody else's.\n\nThe closest thing we have to a de-facto standard JPEG format is some work\nthat's been coordinated by people at C-Cube Microsystems.  They have defined\ntwo JPEG-based file formats:\n  * JFIF (JPEG File Interchange Format), a "low-end" format that transports\n    pixels and not much else.\n  * TIFF/JPEG, aka TIFF 6.0, an extension of the Aldus TIFF format.  TIFF is\n    a "high-end" format that will let you record just about everything you\n    ever wanted to know about an image, and a lot more besides :-).  TIFF is\n    a lot more complex than JFIF, and may well prove less transportable,\n    because different vendors have historically implemented slightly different\n    and incompatible subsets of TIFF.  It's not likely that adding JPEG to the\n    mix will do anything to improve this situation.\nBoth of these formats were developed with input from all the major vendors\nof JPEG-related products; it's reasonably likely that future commercial\nproducts will adhere to one or both standards.\n\nI believe that Usenet should adopt JFIF as the replacement for GIF in\npicture postings.  JFIF is simpler than TIFF and is available now; the\nTIFF 6.0 spec has only recently been officially adopted, and it is still\nunusably vague on some crucial details.  Even when TIFF/JPEG is well\ndefined, the JFIF format is likely to be a widely supported "lowest common\ndenominator"; TIFF/JPEG files may never be as transportable.\n\nA particular case that people may be interested in is Apple's QuickTime\nsoftware for the Macintosh.  QuickTime uses a JFIF-compatible format wrapped\ninside the Mac-specific PICT structure.  Conversion between JFIF and\nQuickTime JPEG is pretty straightforward, and several Mac programs are\navailable to do it (see Mac portion of section 6A).  If you have an editor\nthat handles binary files, you can strip a QuickTime JPEG PICT down to JFIF\nby hand; see section 11 for details.\n\nAnother particular case is Handmade Software's programs (GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF and\nImage Alchemy).  These programs are capable of reading and writing JFIF\nformat.  By default, though, they write a proprietary format developed by\nHSI.  This format is NOT readable by any non-HSI programs and should not be\nused for Usenet postings.  Use the -j switch to get JFIF output.  (This\napplies to old versions of these programs; the current releases emit JFIF\nformat by default.  You still should be careful not to post HSI-format\nfiles, unless you want to get flamed by people on non-PC platforms.)\n\n\n[11]  How do I recognize which file format I have, and what do I do about it?\n\nIf you have an alleged JPEG file that your software won't read, it's likely\nto be HSI format or some other proprietary JPEG-based format.  You can tell\nwhat you have by inspecting the first few bytes of the file:\n\n1.  A JFIF-standard file will start with the characters (hex) FF D8 FF E0,\n    followed by two variable bytes (often hex 00 10), followed by 'JFIF'.\n\n2.  If you see FF D8 at the start, but not the rest of it, you may have a\n    "raw JPEG" file.  This is probably decodable as-is by JFIF software ---\n    it's worth a try, anyway.\n\n3.  HSI files start with 'hsi1'.  You're out of luck unless you have HSI\n    software.  Portions of the file may look like plain JPEG data, but they\n    won't decompress properly with non-HSI programs.\n\n4.  A Macintosh PICT file, if JPEG-compressed, will have a couple hundred\n    bytes of header followed by a JFIF header (scan for 'JFIF').  Strip off\n    everything before the FF D8 and you should be able to read it.\n\n5.  Anything else: it's a proprietary format, or not JPEG at all.  If you are\n    lucky, the file may consist of a header and a raw JPEG data stream.\n    If you can identify the start of the JPEG data stream (look for FF D8),\n    try stripping off everything before that.\n\nIn uuencoded Usenet postings, the characteristic JFIF pattern is\n\n	"begin" line\n	M_]C_X ...\n\nwhereas uuencoded HSI files will start with\n\n	"begin" line\n	M:'-I ...\n\nIf you learn to check for the former, you can save yourself the trouble of\ndownloading non-JFIF files.\n\n\n[12]  What about arithmetic coding?\n\nThe JPEG spec defines two different "back end" modules for the final output\nof compressed data: either Huffman coding or arithmetic coding is allowed.\nThe choice has no impact on image quality, but arithmetic coding usually\nproduces a smaller compressed file.  On typical images, arithmetic coding\nproduces a file 5 or 10 percent smaller than Huffman coding.  (All the\nfile-size numbers previously cited are for Huffman coding.)\n\nUnfortunately, the particular variant of arithmetic coding specified by the\nJPEG standard is subject to patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi.\nThus *you cannot legally use arithmetic coding* unless you obtain licenses\nfrom these companies.  (The "fair use" doctrine allows people to implement\nand test the algorithm, but actually storing any images with it is dubious\nat best.)\n\nAt least in the short run, I recommend that people not worry about\narithmetic coding; the space savings isn't great enough to justify the\npotential legal hassles.  In particular, arithmetic coding *should not*\nbe used for any images to be exchanged on Usenet.\n\nThere is some small chance that the legal situation may change in the\nfuture.  Stay tuned for further details.\n\n\n[13]  Does loss accumulate with repeated compression/decompression?\n\nIt would be nice if, having compressed an image with JPEG, you could\ndecompress it, manipulate it (crop off a border, say), and recompress it\nwithout any further image degradation beyond what you lost initially.\nUnfortunately THIS IS NOT THE CASE.  In general, recompressing an altered\nimage loses more information, though usually not as much as was lost the\nfirst time around.\n\nThe next best thing would be that if you decompress an image and recompress\nit *without changing it* then there is no further loss, i.e., you get an\nidentical JPEG file.  Even this is not true; at least, not with the current\nfree JPEG software.  It's essentially a problem of accumulation of roundoff\nerror.  If you repeatedly compress and decompress, the image will eventually\ndegrade to where you can see visible changes from the first-generation\noutput.  (It usually takes many such cycles to get visible change.)\nOne of the things on our to-do list is to see if accumulation of error can\nbe avoided or limited, but I am not optimistic about it.\n\nIn any case, the most that could possibly be guaranteed would be that\ncompressing the unmodified full-color output of djpeg, at the original\nquality setting, would introduce no further loss.  Even such simple changes\nas cropping off a border could cause further roundoff-error degradation.\n(If you're wondering why, it's because the pixel-block boundaries move.\nIf you cropped off only multiples of 16 pixels, you might be safe, but\nthat's a mighty limited capability!)\n\nThe bottom line is that JPEG is a useful format for archival storage and\ntransmission of images, but you don't want to use it as an intermediate\nformat for sequences of image manipulation steps.  Use a lossless format\n(PPM, RLE, TIFF, etc) while working on the image, then JPEG it when you are\nready to file it away.  Aside from avoiding degradation, you will save a lot\nof compression/decompression time this way :-).\n\n\n[14]  What are some rules of thumb for converting GIF images to JPEG?\n\nAs stated earlier, you *will* lose some amount of image information if you\nconvert an existing GIF image to JPEG.  If you can obtain the original\nfull-color data the GIF was made from, it's far better to make a JPEG from\nthat.  But if you need to save space and have only the GIF to work from,\nhere are some suggestions for getting maximum space savings with minimum\nloss of quality.\n\nThe first rule when converting a GIF library is to look at each JPEG, to\nmake sure you are happy with it, before throwing away the corresponding GIF;\nthat will give you a chance to re-do the conversion with a higher quality\nsetting if necessary.  Some GIFs may be better left as GIFs, as explained in\nsection 3; in particular, cartoon-type GIFs with sixteen or fewer colors\ndon't convert well.  You may find that a JPEG file of reasonable quality\nwill be *larger* than the GIF.  (So check the sizes too.)\n\nExperience to date suggests that large, high-visual-quality GIFs are the best\ncandidates for conversion to JPEG.  They chew up the most storage so offer\nthe most potential savings, and they convert to JPEG with least degradation.\nDon't waste your time converting any GIF much under 100 Kbytes.  Also, don't\nexpect JPEG files converted from GIFs to be as small as those created\ndirectly from full-color originals.  To maintain image quality you may have\nto let the converted files be as much as twice as big as straight-through\nJPEG files would be (i.e., shoot for 1/2 or 1/3rd the size of the GIF file,\nnot 1/4th as suggested in earlier comparisons).\n\nMany people have developed an odd habit of putting a large constant-color\nborder around a GIF image.  While useless, this was nearly free in terms of\nstorage cost in GIF files.  It is NOT free in JPEG files, and the sharp\nborder boundary can create visible artifacts ("ghost" edges).  Do yourself\na favor and crop off any border before JPEGing.  (If you are on an X Windows\nsystem, XV's manual and automatic cropping functions are a very painless\nway to do this.)\n\ncjpeg's default Q setting of 75 is appropriate for full-color input, but\nfor GIF inputs, Q settings of 85 to 95 often seem to be necessary to avoid\nimage degradation.  (If you apply smoothing as suggested below, the higher\nQ setting may not be necessary.)\n\nColor GIFs of photographs or complex artwork are usually "dithered" to fool\nyour eye into seeing more than the 256 colors that GIF can actually store.\nIf you enlarge the image, you will see that adjacent pixels are often of\nsignificantly different colors; at normal size the eye averages these pixels\ntogether to produce the illusion of an intermediate color value.  The\ntrouble with dithering is that, to JPEG, it looks like high-spatial-frequency\ncolor noise; and JPEG can't compress noise very well.  The resulting JPEG\nfile is both larger and of lower image quality than what you would have\ngotten from JPEGing the original full color image (if you had it).\nTo get around this, you want to "smooth" the GIF image before compression.\nSmoothing averages together nearby pixels, thus approximating the color that\nyou thought you saw anyway, and in the process getting rid of the rapid\ncolor changes that give JPEG trouble.  Appropriate use of smoothing will\noften let you avoid using a high Q factor, thus further reducing the size of\nthe compressed file, while still obtaining a better-looking output image\nthan you'd get without smoothing.\n\nWith the V4 free JPEG software (or products based on it), a simple smoothing\ncapability is built in.  Try "-smooth 10" or so when converting GIFs.\nValues of 10 to 25 seem to work well for high-quality GIFs.  Heavy-handed\ndithering may require larger smoothing factors.  (If you can see regular\nfine-scale patterns on the GIF image even without enlargement, then strong\nsmoothing is definitely called for.)  Too large a smoothing factor will blur\nthe output image, which you don't want.  If you are an image processing\nwizard, you can also do smoothing with a separate filtering program, such as\npnmconvol from the PBMPLUS package.  However, cjpeg's built-in smoother is\na LOT faster than pnmconvol...\n\nThe upshot of all this is that "cjpeg -quality 85 -smooth 10" is probably a\ngood starting point for converting GIFs.  But if you really care about the\nimage, you'll want to check the results and maybe try a few other settings.\n\n\n---------------------\n\nFor more information about JPEG in general or the free JPEG software in\nparticular, contact the Independent JPEG Group at jpeg-info@uunet.uu.net.

Version 3 RevB\nis better but if you try to export in SCODAL\nwith a bitmap image included in the drawing\nit will say something like "cannot export\nSCODAL with bitmap"- at least it does on my\nversion.\n If anyone out there knows a way around this\nI am all ears.\n Temporal images make a product called Filmpak\nwhich converts Autocad plots to SCODAL, postscript\nto SCODAL and now GIF to SCODAL but it costs $650\nand I was just wondering if there was anything out\nthere that just did the bitmap to SCODAL part a tad\ncheaper.

WGT is the WordUp Graphics Toolkit, designed by yours truly and my\nco-programmer (and brother) Chris Egerter. It is a Turbo/Borland C++ graphics\nlibrary for programming in 320*200*256 VGA. We are currently producing it as\nshareware, but in a few years it may be a commercial product (excuse typos,\nthere's no backspace on this terminal). Features include:\n\n- loading and saving bit-images (called blocks from herein)\n- flipping, resizing and warping blocks\n- loading and saving palette, fading, several in memory at once\n- graphics primitives such as line, circle, bar, rectangle\n- region fill (not the usually useless floodfill)\n- sprites (animated bitmaps), up to 200 onscreen at once\n- joystick/mouse support\n- SB support (VOC and CMF)\n- tile-based game creation using 16*16 pixel tiles to create\n  a 320*200 tile map (or game world) like in Duke Nuke 'Em\n- number of sprites increased to 1000\n- Professional Sprite Creator utility and Map Maker\n-  routines to simplify scrolling games using maps, etc\n- FLI playing routines, sprites can be animated over the FLI while playing\n- PCX support, soon GIF\n- EMS/XMS coming soon as well\n\nLeave E-mail to Barry Egerter at    egerter@obelix.gaul.csd.uwo.ca\n\nFiles available on:      (use  mget wgt*.zip)\n\nSIMTEL20 and mirrors                pd1:<msdos.turbo-c>\n\nnic.funet.fi                        pub/msdos/games/programming

DMorf (Dave's Morph, I think is what it means) and DTax (Dave's \nTGA Assembler) are available in the MSDOS_UPLOADS directory\non the wuarchive.\n\nThey are arjed and bundled with their respective xmemory versions,\ndmorfx.exe and dtax.exe, you can also find a version of aaplay.exe\nthere, with which you can view files you create with dta.exe or\ndtax.exe.\n\nI downloaded the whole bunch last week and have been morphing \naway the afternoons since.  The programmes are all a bit buggy and\ndefinitely not-ready-to-spread-to-the-masses, but they are very\nwell written. \n\nThe interface is frustrating at first, but it gets easy once you\nfigure out the tricks.\n\nI have noticed that dmorfx will crash horribly if you try to morph\nwithout using the splines option.  Not sure why, since I don't have\nthe source.  I think it was written for TP 6.0.\n\nIf anyone else comes up with any other hints on getting the thing \nto work right, tell me; it took me several hours the first time\njust to figure out that if I just used the durned splines then \nit would work...
I understand there have been a couple of raves in LA billing themselves as\n"Virtual Reality" parties. What I hear they do is project .GIF images around\non the walls, as well as run animations through a Newtek Toaster.\n\nSeems like we need to adopt the term Really Virtual Reality or something, except\nfor the non-immersive stuff which is Virtually Really Virtual Reality.\n\n\netc.\n\n\n\n\n___Samuel___
Hi, \n\nthe subject says it all. Is there a PD viewer for gl files (for X)?\n\nThanks
Greetings all.\n	According to a FAQ I read, on 30 July 1992, Joshua C. Jensen posted an \narticle on bitmap manipulation (specifically, scaling and perspective) to the \nnewsgroup rec.games.programmer. (article 7716)\n	The article included source code in Turbo Pascal with inline assembly \nlanguage.\n\n	I have been unable to find an archive for this newsgroup, or a current \nemail address for Joshua C. Jensen.\n	If anyone has the above details, or a copy of the code, could they \nplease let me know.	Many thanks.\n					Yours gratefully, etc.  Myles.
It should have been made fairly clear that the *most* Crimson would\never get was a 150 (75 old style) MHz CPU upgrade.  Certainly this\nwas mentioned on comp.sys.sgi on more than one occasion as being\nlikely.  If our sales folks were saying otherwise, they were either\nconfused, or less than honest/ethical, or somebody further up the\nchain inside SGI was misleading them.\n\n\nThere were 4 versions (20, 25, 30, 35), although admittedly the 30 came\nout at the same time as the 35, over a period of 2 1/2 years.  The\nchassis simply couldn't be pushed any further.  I'd say 4 years was\na pretty good lifespan, myself, for a system design in this day and\nage.  Getting the 35 to work caused a lot of gray hairs in both the\nhardware and product design groups; we would have been out of our\nminds to push it further, and I *know* that was made clear, almost\nfrom the day the 35 started shipping.  We had one last kicker in\nthe form of the Elan graphics, which made 3 graphics versions over\nits lifespan, which I also think is pretty good.\n\n\nPlease, by all means send a complaint letter through SGI support\nor sales on your concerns.  There should be no reason for sales folks\nto misrepresent future upgrades to customers (sure, sometimes there\nwill be confusion for a while, over whether an upgrade will be available,\nbut that shouldn't last too long, and doesn't seem to be what you\nare referring to).\n\nYes, the sales folks *do* get bonus's at the end of some (all?) quarters,\nbut that is pretty common industry wide, and sometimes that can result\nin good deals for customers (sometimes it probably pushes folks into\nsystems that aren't what they need, I'm sure, but nobody is *forcing*\nyou to buy at end of quarter, after all...)\n\n\nThey don't get all that long a lead time either; although certainly\nthey get presentations on possible new products, and their opinions\nmay well influence the end product, but that also is life in the\nindustry.  We can't design systems that meet just their needs, or we\nwon't sell too many systems, after all (which is not to say that we\ndon't have some niche products, like Reality Engine).\n\n\nBut surely you don't expect a system you buy now for a five year\nperiod to be constantly upgradable over that entire five year\nperiod?  That's a rather unreasonable expectation, in my experience\n(with workstations/microcomputers).  Supported, and parts available,\nyes, but certainly not upgradable to the latest and greatest!\n\n\nI missed your first posting, but as I say, by all means share your\nfrustation with somebody at a level inside SGI where it might\nhave an effect (not immediate, I'm sure, but complaints aren't\ngoing to be ignored, and *may* affect future plans, if we \nhear similar things from more than one person/site).\n\nAll of the above is, as usual, my personal opinion, not SGI's.
Sean, the 68070 exists! :-)\n\n\n\n   Sean, I don't want to get into a 'mini-war' by what I am going to say,\nbut I have to be a little bit skeptic about the performance you are\nclaiming on the Centris, you'll see why (please, no-flames, I reserve\nthose for c.s.m.a :-) )\n\n   I was in Chicago in the last consumer electronics show, and Apple had a\nbooth there.  I walked by, and they were showing real-time video capture\nusing a (Radious or SuperMac?) card to digitize and make right on the spot\nquicktime movies.  I think the quicktime they were using was the old one\n(1.5).\n\n   They digitized a guy talking there in 160x2xx something.  It played back quite\nnicely and in real time.  The guy then expanded the window (resized) to 25x by\n3xx (320 in y I think) and the frame rate decreased enough to notice that it\nwasn't 30fps (or about 30fps) anymore.  It dropped to like 15 fps.  Then he\nincreased it just a bit more, and it dropped to 10<->12 fps. \n\n   Then I asked him what Mac he was using... He was using a Quadra (don't know\nwhat model, 900?) to do it, and he was telling the guys there that the Quicktime\ncould play back at the same speed even on an LCII.\n\n   Well, I spoiled his claim so to say, since a 68040 Quadra Mac was having\na little bit of trouble.  And this wasn't even from the hardisk!  This was\nfrom memory!\n\n   Could it be that you saw either a newer version of quicktime, or some\nhardware assisted Centris, or another software product running the \nanimation (like supposedly MacroMind's Accelerator?)?\n\n   Don't misunderstand me, I just want to clarify this.\n\n   But for the sake of the posting about a computer doing it or not, I can\nclaim 320x200 (a tad more with overscan) being done in 256,000+ colors in \nmy computer (not from the hardisk) at 30fps with Scala MM210.\n\n   But I agree, if we consider MPEG stuff, I think a multimedia consumer\nlow-priced box has a lot of market... I just think 3DO would make it, \nno longer CD-I.
I am looking for a program that is capable of displaying a graph\nwith nodes and links and with the possibility to edit interactively\nthe graph : add one node, change one link etc...\n\nActually, a very _simple_ X11 program would be ok; all I need is to\nput some "boxes" (i.e. the nodes ) on a pane and be able to\nmanipulate them with the mouse (move, add or delete boxes).\n\nDoes anyone know if such program is available ?\nThanks for any help !!
Does anyone out there have or know of, any kind of utility program for\n\nRibbons?\n\n\nRibbons are a popular representation for 2D shape.  I am trying to\nfind symmetry axis in a given any 2D shape using ribbons.\n\n\nAny suggestions will be greatly appreciated how to start program. \n\n\nThanks very much in advance,\nHoi
Does anybody know what Delaunay Triangulation is?\nIs there any reference to it? \nIs it useful for creating 3-D objects? If yes, what's the advantage?\n\nThanks in advance.
Yeah, of course... The term 'mach banding' was not the correct one, it should've\nbeen 'color quantization effect'. Although a bad color quantization effect could\nresult in some visible mach-bands on a picture that was smooth before it was\nquantizised.
I need the file format for cc:Mail file formats - it seems to be PCX-based,\nbut with a twist: only the first page of a multi-page fax will come out\nreadable. The other pages disappear. The format seems to be 'proprietary'.\n\nAnybody got any clues? I have to give my email FAXes to my secretary in\norder to get 'em unscrambled. I want a filter from cc:Mail to .p[nb]m.\n\nCome to think of it, p[nb]m to cc:Mail would be nice too.
Hello,\n\n    I have been searching for a quality image enhancement and\n    manipulation package for Unix/X/Motif platforms that is comparable\n    to Adobe Photo Shop for the Mac.\n\n    I have not been able to find any, and would appreciate any\n    information about such products you could provide.\n\n    I would be particularly interested in software that runs on HP or\n    Sun workstations, and does not require special add-in hardware, but\n    would also be interested in other solutions.\n\n\nThank You.\nWayne
Yesterday I wrote a program to do bilinear interpolation ala Numerical\nRecipes, with the PBMPLUS libraries.  I'm pretty happy with the results,\nbut I'm looking for any already-coded non-linear interpolation schemes\nbefore I go ahead an try to write one.  Any pointers?\n\n--
: Are there significant differences between V2.01 and V2.00 ?\n: Thank you for helping\n\n\nNo.  As I recall, the only differences are in the 3ds.set parameters - some\nof the defaults have changed slightly.  I'll look when I get home and let\nyou know, but there isn't enough to actually warrant upgrading.
Dominik,\n\n	Have you tried xgrasp?  It's out there on several ftp sites.(not sure which, but archie can find it, I'm sure.)  It works ok but it lacks an interface.
Hi there\n\nI am very interested in Rayshade 4.00. I have managed to make a chessboard\nfor Rayshade. Unfortunately I still have to do the knight (horse). Any ideas?\nI am also looking for a surface for the chesspieces. The board is marble.\nUnfortunately black won't work very well for the one side. Anybody with ideas\nfor nice surfaces?\n\nI would also like to use the image command of rayshade and the heightfield\ncommand. Unfortunately the manual is very vague about this, and I don't have\nCraig Kolb's email address. Anybody with ideas, because this is essential\nfor my next venture into raytracing.\n\nWhere should I post the finished chessboard?\n\nIs there anybody else using rayshade on non-Unix systems?\n\nHow fast does Unix render?\n\nThanks
That's closer, but I dislike "apps".  "software" (vs. "hardware")\nwould be better.  Would that engulf alt.graphics.pixutils?  Or would\nthat be "programmer"?\n\nI don't know if traffic is really heavy enough to warrant a newsgroup\nsplit.  Look how busy comp.graphics.research is (not).\n\nIt's true that a lot of the traffic here is rehashing FAQs and\ndiscussing things that would probably be better diverted to\nsystem-specific groups, but I don't know whether a split would help\nor hurt that cause.\n\nMaybe we need a comp.graphics.RTFB for all those people who can't be\nbothered to read the fine books out there.  Right, Dr. Rogers? :-)
Hi! Everyone,\n\nBecause no one has touched the problem I posted last week, I guess\nmy question was not so clear. Now I'd like to describe it in detail:\n\nThe offset of an ellipse is the locus of the center of a circle which\nrolls on the ellipse. In other words, the distance between the ellipse\nand its offset is same everywhere.\n\nThis problem comes from the geometric measurement when a probe is used.\nThe tip of the probe is a ball and the computer just outputs the\npositions of the ball's center. Is the offset of an ellipse still\nan ellipse? The answer is no! Ironically, DMIS - an American Indutrial\nStandard says it is ellipse. So almost all the software which was\nimplemented on the base of DMIS was wrong. The software was also sold\ninternationaly. Imagine, how many people have or will suffer from this bug!!!\nHow many qualified parts with ellipse were/will be discarded? And most\nimportantly, how many defective parts with ellipse are/will be used?\n\nI was employed as a consultant by a company in Los Angeles last year\nto specially solve this problem. I spent two months on analysis of this\nproblem and six months on programming. Now my solution (nonlinear)\nis not ideal because I can only reconstruct an ellipse from its entire\nor half offset. It is very difficult to find the original ellipse from\na quarter or a segment of its offset because the method I used is not\nanalytical. I am now wondering if I didn't touch the base and make things\ncomplicated. Please give me a hint.\n\nI know you may argue this is not a CG problem. You are right, it is not.\nHowever, so many people involved in the problem "sphere from 4 poits".\nWhy not an ellipse? And why not its offset?\n\nPlease post here and let the others share our interests \n(I got several emails from our netters, they said they need the\nsummary of the answers).
Hi Folks,\n\n   Does anyone have a copy of Playmation they'd be willing to sell me.  I'd \nlove to try it out, but not for the retail $$$.  If you have moved onto \nsomething bigger (3DS) or better (Imagine), I'd love to buy your table scraps.\n\n   If noone is selling, can anyone recommend a place to buy Playmation \nmail-order for cheap?  \n\n   Thanks in advance,\n\n   Mark\n\n\n\n--

I downloaded an image of the earth re-constructed from elevation data taken\nat 1/2 degree increments. The author (not me) wrote some c-code (included)\nthat read in the data file and generated b&w and pseudo color images. They\nwork very well and are not incumbered by copyright. They are at an aminet\nsite near you called earth.lha in the amiga/pix/misc area...\n\nI refer you to the included docs for the details on how the author (sorry, I\nforget his name) created these images.

Places to find the Resource Listing\n======================================\n\n#This file is crossposted to comp.graphics, comp.answers and news.answers,\nso if you can't locate it in comp.graphics, you're advised to search in\n#comp.answers or news.answers\n(The latter groups usually are archived in your site. Contact your sysadmin\nfor more info).\n\nThese 3 articles are posted to comp.graphics 3-4 times a month and are kept in\nmany places (see below)\n\n--\n\nMany FAQs, including this one, are available on the archive site\npit-manager.mit.edu (alias rtfm.mit.edu) [18.172.1.27] in the directory\npub/usenet/news.answers.  The name under which a FAQ is archived appears\nin the Archive-name line at the top of the article.\nThis FAQ is archived as graphics/resources-list/part[1-3]\n\nThere's a mail server on that machine. You send a e-mail message to\nmail-server@pit-manager.mit.edu  containing: help in the Subject: field\n\n--\n\nThe inria-graphlib mail server mirrors this posting (see under the\nSubject 4: Mail servers )\n\n--\n\nThe Resource Listing is accesible through WAIS in the machine\nenuxva.eas.asu.edu (port 8000) under the name graphics-resources-list.\nIt's got a digest-type line before every numbered item for purposes of\nindexing.\n\n--\n\nAnother place that monitors the Listing is the MaasInfo files.\nFor more info contact Robert E. Maas <rem@btr.com>\n\n--\n\nYet another place to search for FAQs in general is the SWITCH\n(Swiss Academic and Research Network) system in Switzerland:\n\ninteractive:\n  telnet nic.switch.ch [130.59.1.40], login as "info". Move to the\n  info_service/Usenet/periodic-postings directory. Search in the\n  00index file by typing "/" and the word to look for.\n  You may then just read the FAQ in the "faqs" directory, or decide\n  to fetch it by one of the following methods.\n\nftp:\n  login to nic.switch.ch [130.59.1.40] as user anonymous and\n  enter your internet-style address after being prompted for a\n  password.\n\n	cd info_service/Usenet/periodic-postings\n\nmail:\n  send e-mail to\n\nRFC-822:\n   archive-server@nic.switch.ch\nX.400:\n  /S=archive-server/OU=nic/O=switch/PRMD=switch/ADMD=arcom/C=ch/\n\nEnter 'help' in the bodypart to receive instructions. No information\nis required in the subject header line.\n\n\n1. ARCHIE\n=========\n\nThe Archie is a service system to locate FTP places for\nrequested files. It's appreciated that you will use Archie\nbefore asking help in the newsgroups.\n\nArchie servers:\n  archie.au or 139.130.4.6             (Aussie/NZ)\n  archie.funet.fi or 128.214.6.100  (Finland/Eur.)\n  archie.th-darmstadt.de or 130.83.128.111  (GER.)\n  cs.huji.ac.il or 132.65.6.5             (Israel)\n  archie.kuis.kyoto-u.ac.jp or 130.54.20.1 (JAPAN)\n  archie.sogang.ac.kr or 163.239.1.11      (Korea)\n  archie.ncu.edu.tw or telnet 140.115.19.24  (TWN)\n  archie.doc.ic.ac.uk or 146.169.3.7  (UK/Ireland)\n  archie.sura.net or 128.167.254.179    (USA [MD])\n  archie.unl.edu (password: archie1)    (USA [NE])\n  archie.ans.net or 147.225.1.2         (USA [NY])\n  archie.rutgers.edu or 128.6.18.15     (USA [NJ])\n  archie.nz or 130.195.9.4           (New Zealand)\n\nConnect to Archie server with telnet and type "archie" as username.\nTo get help type 'help'.\nYou can get 'xarchie' or 'archie', which are clients that call Archie\nwithout the burden of a telnet session.\n'Xarchie' is on the X11.R5 contrib tape, and 'archie' on comp.sources.misc,\nvol. 27.\n\nTo get information on how to use Archie via e-mail, send mail with\nsubject "help" to "archie" account at any of above sites.\n\n(Note to Janet/PSS users -- the United Kingdom archie site is\naccessible on the Janet host doc.ic.ac.uk [000005102000].\nConnect to it and specify "archie" as the host name and "archie" as\nthe username.)\n\n==========================================================================\n\n2. Notes\n========\n(Excerpted from the FAQ article)\n\nPlease do *not* post or mail messages saying "I can't FTP, could\nsomeone mail this to me?"  There are a number of automated mail servers\nthat will send you things like this in response to a message.\n\nThere are a number of sites that archive the Usenet sources newsgroups\nand make them available via an email query system.  You send a message\nto an automated server saying something like "send comp.sources.unix/fbm",\nand a few hours or days later you get the file in the mail.\n\n==========================================================================\n\n3.

Printer model and specification:\n\nCanon CLC 500 (Color Laser Copier)\nps-ipu unit (postscript intelligent processing unit)\n\n\nHello,\n\nWe have recently purchased a very expensive and nice color copier/printer. \nWe want to be able to print to it from our SGI iris network.  The \ncopier/printer has both a parallel and SCSI interface.  I have configured the\nprinter with the "lp" system using the parallel interface and can print \npostscript files to the printer.  I can also print rgb files, but these are in \nturn converted to postscript by an internal filter.  The Canon CLC 500 is a \npublication quality printer but the quality of our postscript printouts \nare less than acceptable.  We create the postscript files with a variaty of \nprograms, such as showcase, xv, and tops.  When we convert to postscript \nwith tops and use the -l option to specify the halftone screen density of 98 \nrather than the default 40 the output is better, but still much less that \nacceptable.  Note, that we are starting with a screen image in rgb image format\nand translating the image into postscript.\n\nWe suspect that if we could use the SCSI interface we would get higher quality \npictures.  We have not purchased the software that drives the printer from the \nSCSI port.  To my knowledge this software is $5000 and does not come with a \nwarranty.  The management here does not want to spend this much money without \nsome assurance that the product will work.\n\n\nHere my questions:\n\nIf anybody on the net uses this printer are you using the SCSI or \nparallel port?  What is the quality of the printouts?\n\nIs there a way to create high quality postscript printouts?  What is the\nlimiting component, the postscript language or the postscript interpretor on \nthe printer?\n \nThe Big question:\n\nWhere can I get some software to drive the SCSI port for this printer?\n\n\n\nPlease email directly to me, I don't not read news on a regular basis. \nI will post a summary.\n\nThanks in advance.
I was recently talking to a possible employer ( mine! :-) ) and he made a reference to a\n48-bit graphics computer/image processing system.  I seem to remember it being called IMAGE or\nsomething akin to that.  Anyway, he claimed it had 48-bit color + a 12-bit alpha channel.  That's\n60 bits of info--what could that possibly be for?  Specifically the 48-bit color?  That's 280\ntrillion colors, many more than the human eye can resolve.  Is this an anti-aliasing thing?  Or\nis this just some magic number to make it work better with a certain processor.\n\n	Also, to settle a bet with my roommate, what are SGI's flagship products?  I know of\nIris, Indigo, and Crimson, but what are the other ones, and which is their top-of-the-line?\n(sadly, I have access to none of them.  Just a DEC 5000/25.  Sigh.)

A 3DO marketing rep. recently offered a Phillips marketing rep. a $100\nbet that 3DO would have boxes on the market on schedule.  The Phillips\nrep. declined the bet, probably because he knew that 3DO players are\nalready in pre-production manufacturing runs, 6 months before the\ncommercial release date.\n\nBy the time of commercial release, there will be other manufacturers of\n3DO players announced and possibly already tooling up production.  Chip\nsets will be in full production.  The number of software companies\ndesigning titles for the box will be over 300.\n\nHow do I know this?

We\ngot to see the unit displaying full-screen movies using the CompactVideo codec\n(which was nice, very little blockiness showing clips from Jaws and Backdraft)\n... and a very high frame rate to boot (like 30fps).\n\nNote however that the 3DO's screen resolution is 320x240.\n\nCompactVideo is pretty amazing... I also wanted to point out that QuickTime\ndoes indeed slow down when one dynamically resizes material as was stated\nabove... I'm sure if the material had been compressed at the large size\nthen it would play back fine (I have a Q950 and do this quite a bit). The\nprice of generality... personally I don't use the dynamic sizing of movies\noften, if ever. But playing back stuff at its original size is plenty quick\non the latest 040 machines.\n\nI'm not sure how a Centris/20MHz 040 stacks up against the 25 MHz ARM in\nthe 3DO box. Obviously the ARM is faster, but how much?

Hello,
A shareware graphics program called Pman has a filter that makes a picture\nlook like a hand drawing.  This picture could probably be converted into\nvector format much easier because it is all lines. (With Corel Trace, etc..)
What kind of polygons?  Shaded?  Texturemapped?  Hm?  More comes into play with\nfast routines than just "polygons".  It would be nice to know exaclty what\nsystem (VGA is a start, but what processor?) and a few of the specifics of the\nimplementation.  You need to give  more info if you want to get any answers! :P\n\n                                  - Ian Romanick\n                                    Dancing Fool of Epsilon

Hi Everyone--\n\n  It's spend-the-money-before-it-goes-away time here at U.Florida\nand we need to find some PC-based software that will do contour\nplotting with irregular boundaries,i.e., a 2-D profile of a soil\n                                    system with a pond superimposed\n                /-----------------  on it.  We've given SURFER a\n    POND      /                  |  trial run but it interpolates\n            /                    |  contours out into the pond and/or\n----------/                      |  creates artifacts at the borders.\na response, I'll post a summary.

OK, I don't use CView anymore, but I saw that no one had explaind this\n"bug" in the thread, so here goes:\n\nIt is NOT the fault of CView.  It is DOS!  If you leave a file open on a\nfloppy drive, then change the disk and do something which updates or closes\nthat file, you have a good chance of getting part of the directory and FAT\nfrom the other disk written to the new disk.  This has always been true,\nand has destroyed data under other programs, not just CView.\n\nThe only thing CView can do to improve the situation is to try not to leave\nfiles open unless it's actively using them (ie, reading and decoding).
We are interested in purchasing a grayscale printer that offers a good\nresoltuion for grayscale medical images.  Can anybody give me some\nrecommendations on these products in the market, in particular, those\nunder $5000?
Greetings,\n    I have an Epson HI-80 4 pen plotter forsale.  It emulates an HP 7570\nor 7574 - I'm not sure which.  It has an option board on it that does\nthe emulation.  It has a serial interface with Hardware handshake. I\nalso have 340 Pens for it as follows:  10 packs of 4 Black Oil based, 16\npacks of 4 Red,Green, Blue, and Black pens, 22 packs of 4 Aqueous Black,\n7 packs of 4 Aqueous R,G,Blue,Black,  1 pack of 6 Aqueous Multi color\npens,  and 114 assorted non-packaged pens mostly colored.\n\n    The plotter is used.  I have tested it using the Windows drivers for\nHP 7570 and HP 7574 and both worked fine.  It accepts either A or B\nsized paper. (8.5 x 11 or 11x17).\n\n    I figure that the plotter is worth about $300 and the pens are worth at\nleast another $200 more..  One thing is certain, you won't need to\npurchase any pens for quite a while...  All of the packaged pens were\nsealed so they are all still fresh.  The rest were capped and seem to\nfunction as well.\n\n    I'd be willing to sell the pens seperate if anyone is interested in\njust them.\n\n    I'm selling it because I got a HP LaserJet and I don't need color.\n\n    I'd like $350 or best offer...\n\n    -Chert
RADIOSITY SOURCES WANTED !!!\n============================\n\nWhen I read the comp.graphics group, I never found something about \nradiosity. Is there anybody interested in out there? I would be glad \nto hear from somebody.\nI am looking for source-code for the radiosity-method. I have already\nread common literature, e. g.Foley ... . I think little examples could \nhelp me to understand how radiosity works. Common languages ( C, C++, \nPascal) prefered.\nI hope you will help me!
Yes, I am very interested in this chip.  Please follow up or email.

This algorithm works well for me:\n\nAlgorithm to attempt to find outward-facing normals:\n---------------------------------------------------\nFirst, mark all faces as UNKNOWN.\n\nThen create an edge dictionary that allows you to find all of the\nfaces sharing a given edge (where an edge is two integers representing\nthe two shared vertices).\n\nPick an arbitrary face and mark it COUNTER_CLOCKWISE.  Using the edge\ndictionary, orient all surrounding faces based on the orientation of\nthis face.  And recurse for all surrounding faces, consistently\norienting the entire surface.\n\nFind the average of the vertices in this surface.  Using that point,\ncalculate a volume measurement, taking into account the face's\norientation.  If the volume turns out to be positive, assume the faces\nare oriented correctly.  If it is negative, reverse their orientations\n(mark them CLOCKWISE).\n\nIf any faces are still UNKNOWN after this, choose another face\nand go through the algorithm again.\n\nAt the end, faces marked CLOCKWISE must have their indices reversed\nbefore facet normals are found.\n\n(Note: if you are running on Silicon Graphics machines and buy the\nIRIS Inventor 3D toolkit developers package you have the source to\nthis algorithm-- see /usr/src/Inventor/tools/ivnorm/.  If you're\nnot... sorry, I can't give out the source, and even if I could it\nrelies heavily on Inventor).

This sounds wonderful, but it seems no one either wants to spend time doing\nthis, or they don't have the power to do so.  For example, I would like\nto see a comp.graphics architecture like this:\n\ncomp.graphics.algorithms.2d\ncomp.graphics.algorithms.3d\ncomp.graphics.algorithms.misc\ncomp.graphics.hardware\ncomp.graphics.misc\ncomp.graphics.software/apps\n\nHowever, that is almost overkill.  Something more like this would probably\nmake EVERYONE a lot happier:\n\ncomp.graphics.programmer\ncomp.graphics.hardware\ncomp.graphics.apps\ncomp.graphics.misc\n\nIt would be nice to see specialized groups devote to 2d, 3d, morphing,\nraytracing, image processing, interactive graphics, toolkits, languages,\nobject systems, etc. but these could be posted to a relevant group or\nhave a mailing list organized.\n\nThat way when someone reads news they don't have to see these subject\nheadings, which are rather disparate:\n\nSystem specific stuff ( should be under comp.sys or comp.os.???.programmer ):\n\n	"Need help programming GL"\n	"ModeX programming information?"\n	"Fast sprites on PC"\n\nHardware technical stuff:\n\n	"Speed of Weitek P9000"\n	"Drivers for SpeedStar 24X"\n\nApplications oriented stuff:\n\n	"VistaPro 3.0 help"\n	"How good is 3dStudio?"\n	"Best image processing program for Amiga"\n\nProgramming oriented stuff:\n\n	"Fast polygon routine needed"\n	"Good morphing alogirhtm wanted"\n	"Best depth sort for triangles?"\n	"Which C++ library to get?"\n\nI wish someone with the power would get a CFD and then a CFV going on\nthis stuff....this newsgroup needs it.

Scott,\n	I'm not so sure if this is helpful, but I usually use XV v2.21.  I use Sun IPCs and IPXs, and it works fine.

Hi.  I'm writing a program to convert .dxf files to a database\nformat used by a 3D graphics program I've written.  My program stores\nthe points of a polygon in CCW order.  I've used 3D Concepts a \nlittle and it seems that the points are stored in the order\nthey are drawn.\n\nDoes the DXF format have a way of indicating which order the \npoints are stored in, CW or CCW?  Its easy enough to convert,\nbut if I don't know which way they are stored, I dont know \nwhich direction the polygon should be visible from.\n\nIf DXF doesn't handle this, can anyone recommend a workaround?\nThe best I can think of is to create two polygons for each one\nin the DXF file, one stored CW and the other CCW.  But that\ndoubles the number of polygons and decreases speed...\n\nThanks in advance for any help,
Yes, but... shouldn't size of newsgroup be an issue?  Sorry if this\nhas been covered before, but comp.grahpics.animation get how much \ntraffic per day?  50 articles?

Hi.\n\nThe RTrace ray tracer supports 3D text as a primitive, not collections of\nspheres, cylinders and so on...\nThe 3D chars are made of lines and splines that are extruded...\n\nPlease have a look at asterix.inescn.pt [192.35.246.17] in directory\npub/RTrace.\nIn pub/RTrace/tmp there are some demo images with high quality text.\nAll of them are called Text?.jpg (JPEG encoded). See them first and then\ntell me what you think.
Hi there,\n\nI've made a VGA mode 13h graphics library available via FTP.  I originally\nwrote the routines as a kind of exercise for myself, but perhaps someone\nhere will find them useful.  They are certainly useable as they are, but\nare missing some higher-level functionality.  They're intended more as an\nintro to mode 13h programming, a starting point.\n\n*** The library assumes a 386 processor, but it is trivial to modify it\n*** for a 286.  If enough people ask, I'll make the mods and re-post it as a\n*** different version.\n\nThe routines are written in assembly (TASM) and are callable from C.  They\nare fairly simple, but I've found them to be very fast (for my purposes,\nanyway).  Routines are included to enter and exit mode 13h, define a\n"virtual screen", put and get pixels, put a pixmap (rectangular image with\nno transparent spots), put a sprite (image with see-thru areas), copy\nareas of the virtual screen into video memory, etc.  I've also included a\nsimple C routine to draw a line, as well as a C routine to load a 256\ncolor GIF image into a buffer.  I also wrote a quick'n'dirty(tm) demo program\nthat bounces a bunch of sprites around behind three "windows".\n\nThe whole package is available on spang.camosun.bc.ca in /pub/dos/vgl.zip \nIt is zipped with pkzip 2.04g\n\nIt is completely in the public domain, as far as I'm concerned.  Do with\nit whatever you like.  However, it'd be nice to get credit where it's due,\nand maybe an e-mail telling me you like it (if you don't like it don't bother)

Yes, there are serveral programs which can convert font files (eq the Borland\nfonts) to objects consisting of spheres, cones etc. \nI've used a program (forgot its name/place, but i can look for it) which\nconverted these Borland fonts to three different raytracers. Vivid, POV and\nPolyray (which i like more (more flexibel/faster/use of expressions etc).\nThe program has a lot nice features.\nSo if interested give me a mail.
I wanted to know if any of you out there can recommend a good\nbook about graphics, still and animated, and in VGA/SVGA.\n\nThanks in advance
Actually the most flexible way to create temp files is to check for a TEMP or\nTMP environment variable and create the files on the drive and directory pointedto by the variable.  This is pretty much a standard for DOS, Windows and OS/2\napplications.\n\n\n-- \nWhat I have to say is my own opinion and has no bearing on any other person or\norganization including my employer.
Note the Followup-To: header ...\n\n\nOn my SVR4 Amiga Unix box, I've got -lform, -lmenu, and -lpanel for\nuse with the curses library.  Guess what they provide? :-)\n\nUnix Press, ie. Prentice-Hall, has a programmer's guide for these\ntools, referred to as the FMLI (Forms Mgmt Language Interface) and\nETI (Extended Terminal Interface), now in it's 2nd edition.  It is\nISBN 0-13-020637-7.\n\nParaphrased from the outside back cover:\n\n    FMLI is a high-level programming tool for creating menus, forms,\n    and text frames.  ETI is a set of screen management library\n    subroutines that promote fast development of application programs\n    for window, panel, menu, and form manipulation.\n\nThe FMLI is a shell package which reads ascii text files and produces\nscreen displays for data entry and presentation.  It consists of a\n"shell-like" environment of the "fmli" program and it's database\nfiles.  It is section 1F in the Unix Press manual.\n\nThe ETI are subroutines, part of the 3X manual section, provide\nsupport for a multi-window capability on an ordinary ascii terminal\nwith controls built on top of the curses library.

Another source:  There's a poly blitter for mode y (mode x in 320x200)\nat sunee.uwaterloo.ca.  Also there is REND386, an even faster 3D\nrenderer with VR extensions.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Of course, I do not agree.  It does have more horsepower.  Horsepower is not\nthe only measurement for 'better'.  It does not have full motion, full screen\nvideo yet.  Does it have CD-ROM XA?\n\nWhich other manufacturers?\nWe shall see about the date.\n\nThis is second hand, but it still hard to look to the future ;-).
There are several public domain utilities available at your usual\narchive site that allow 'extraction' of single frames from a .gl\nfile, check in the 'graphics' directories under *grasp.  The problem \nis that the .clp files you generate cannot be decoded by any of \nthe many pd format converters I have used. Any hint welcome!\nLet me know if you have problems locating the utilities.\nHope it helps.
Hi all,\n\n  I am looking for a recommandation on a good royalty free graphics\nlibrary package for C and C++ program.  This is mainly use to write\nchildren games and education software.  I heard someone mentioned Genus\nand also GFX ?  Are they any good?\n\nPlease pardon me if my question sounds a little strange, I am asking\nthis question for a friend.\n\nThanks in advance!
A developable surface is s.t. you can lay it (or roll it) flat on the\nplane (it may require you to give it a "cut" though...)\n\nE.g., a cylinder, a cone, a plane (of course!) or any surface or patch\nhaving vanishing Gaussian (intrinsic) curvature (i.e., with singular\nHessian, the matrix of 2nd derivatives for an adequate coordinate patch)\nare "developable". In more technical words, a developable surface is\n"locally isometric to a plane" at all points.\n\n\nThink also of the sphere (or the earth) which in a non-developable:\nwhatever way(s) you cut it, you will not be able to lay flat any pieces\nof it... (its intrinsic curvature is nowhere vanishing).\n\nFor more details on this look at any book on differential geometry\nwhich treats surfaces (2D manifolds); e.g., M. do Carmo's book:\n\n@Book{Carmo76Differential,\n  author =      {do Carmo, Manfredo P.},\n  title =       {Differential Geometry of Curves and Surfaces},\n  year =        1976,\n  publisher =   {Prentice-Hall},\n  note =        {503 pages.}}\n\nEnjoy!

There is a new version of the RTrace ray-tracing package (8.2.0) at\nasterix.inescn.pt [192.35.246.17] in directory pub/RTrace.\nCheck the README file.\n\nRTrace now can use the SUIT toolkit to have a nice user interface.\nCompile it with -DSUIT or modify the Makefile.\nSUIT is available at suit@uvacs.cs.virginia.edu\nI have binaries of RTrace with SUIT for SUN Sparc, SGI Indigo\nand DOS/GO32.\nPlease contact me if interested.\n\n****************************************\n\nThe MAC RTrace 1.0 port is in directory pub/RTrace/Macintosh\nThanks to Reid Judd (reid.judd@east.sun.com) and\nGreg Ferrar (gregt@function.mps.ohio-state.edu).\n\n****************************************\n\nSmall changes were done since version 8.1.0, mainly:\n\n1. Now it is possible to discard backface polygons and triangles\n   for fast preview...\n\n2.

First, thanks to all who replied to my original question.
I'm not sure if you got the information you were looking for, so I'll\npost it anyway for the general public.  To load an image on your root\nwindow add this line to the end of your .xsession file:\n\n xloadimage -onroot -fullscreen <gif_file_name> &\n\nThis is assuming of course you have the xloadimage client, and as\nfor the switches, I think they pretty much explain what is going on.\nIf you leave out the <&>, the terminal locks till you kill it.\n(You already knew that though...)\n\nHope this helps.

There is a new product for the (IBM'ers) out there... it is called\nIMAGINE and it just started shipping yesterday... I can personally attest that it will blow the doors off of 3D-Studio.  It is made by IMPUlSE, and is in its\n3rd version....(1st) for the IBM.... it can do morphing, your standard key-framming animation, it is a raytracer (reflections & shadows), and can do/apply special FX to objects... (like ripple, explode, bounce) things of that nature.  Also it has algorithmic texture maps....and your standard brushmapping also...\n\nyou can have animated brushmaps...(ie. live video mapped on the objs)...\nalso animated backdrops (ie. live video backgrounds)\nalso animted reflections maps....\n\nyou get the idea.... it will run for about 500$ retail (I think)...\n\ndont let the low price fool you.... this product can do it all when it\ncomes to 3D-animation and Renderering...!\n\nalso....does anyone here know how to get in the Imagine mailing list??\nplease e-mail me if you do or post up here....\n\noh...the number for IMPULSE is --->1 800 328 0184

About a year ago I started work on a problem that appeared to\nbe very simple and turned out to be quite difficult.  I am wondering if\nanyone on the net has seen this problem and (hopefully) some published \nsolutions to it.\n\n	The problem is to draw an outline of a surface defined by two\nroughly parallel cubic splines.  For inputs the problem essentially\nstarts with two sets of points where each set of points is on the \nedge of an object which we treat as two dimensional, i.e. only extant\nbetween the edges, but which exists in three dimensional space.  To draw \nthe object we \n\n1) fit a cubic spline through the points.  Each spline is effectively\n	computed as a sequence of line segments approximating the\n        curve.  Each spline has an equal number of segments.  We assume\n	that the nth segment along each spline is roughly, but not\n	exactly, the same distance along each spline by any reasonable\n	measure.\n2) Take each segment (n) along each spline and match it to the nth segment\n	of the opposing spline.  Use the pair of segments to form two\n	triangles which will be filled in to color the surface.\n3) Depth sort the triangles\n4) Take each triangle in sorted order, project onto a 2D pixmap, draw\n	and color the triangle.  Take the edge of the triangle that is\n	along the edge of the surface and draw a line along that edge\n	colored with a special "edge color"\n\n	It is the edge coloring in step 4 that is at the heart of the\nproblem.  The idea is to effectively outline the edge of the surface.\nThe net result however generally has lots of breaks and gaps in\nthe edge of the surface.  The reasons for this are fairly complicated.\nThey involve both rasterization problems and problems resulting\nfrom the projecting the splines.  If anything about this problem\nsounds familiar we would appreciate knowing about other work in this\narea.

Hi Noel,\n\nI've made some attempts to write a converter that reads Adobe Type 1 fonts,\ntriangulates them, bevelizes them and extrudes them to result in a generic\n3d object which could be used with PoV f.i.\n\nThe problem I'm currently stuck on is that theres no algorithm which\ntriangulates any arbitrary polygonal shape. Delaunay seems to be limited\nto convex hulls. Constrained delaunay may be okay, but I have no code\nexample of how to do it.\n\nAnother way to do the bartman may be\n\n- TGA2POV\n- A selfmade variation of this, using heightfields.\n\n  Create a b/w picture (BIG) of the text you need, f.i. using a PostScript\n  previewer. Then, use this as a heightfield. If it is white on black,\n  the heightfield is exactly the images white parts (it's still open\n  on the backside). To close it, mirror it and compound it with the original.\n\nExample:\n\nobject {\n   union {\n      height_field { gif "abp2.gif" }\n      height_field { gif "abp2.gif" scale <1 -1 1>}\n   }\n   texture {\n      Glass\n   }\n   translate <-0.5 0 -0.5>      //center\n   rotate <-90 0 0>             // rotate upwards\n   scale  <10 5 100>            // scale bigger and thicker\n   translate <0 2 0>            // final placement\n}\n\n\nabp2.gif is a GIF of arbitrary size containing "ABP" black on white in\nTimes-Roman 256 points.
I don't have nor Imagine nor Real 3d, but as old\nAmiga user I think you should take a look also to \nReal 3d 2.0 for the Amiga. I saw Imagine 2.0 on the\nAmiga for a long time at my friend's home, and\nI've seen R3D 2.0 in action at Bit.Movie 93 in Riccione,\nItaly (an Italian Computer Graphics Contest).\nMany professionals using 3d Studio on PC, SoftImage\nfor Silicon Graphics and Imagine on the Amiga were \n*VERY IMPRESSED* by the power of this programs.\nSorry, I've lost the posting with full description \nof features of this great program.\n\nFor more informations give a look in comp.sys.amiga.graphics.\n\nRepresentative of Activa International told me that\nit will be out in 2 weeks for the Amiga and that\nPC MS-Windows, Silicon Indigo and Unix version are \nunder development.\n\nCiao,\n	Sergio
Hello,\nI purchased my new 486 with a NoName graphics card installed which is obviously \nSpeedstar 24 compatible. Its name is "VGA 4000 TrueColor".\nIt is accompanied with some drivers and the utilities VMODE, XMODE and\nat least one more MODE, as well as some drivers for Lotus, Windows, etc.\nOnly one of the drivers is told to provide the TrueColor mode, namely\nthe Windows 3.1 driver.\nNowhere else, except in the ad, is any pointer to the TrueColor mode.\nSome articles in this group about the Speedstar 24 and some other facts\nmade me believe that my card is compatible to that one.\n\nDoes anybody out there know how this mode can be adjusted? How can I write\na driver which allows me to have 16.7 millions of colors with a resolution\nof 640 x 480 with 45 Hz interlaced ?

Hi Steve,\n\nAs the author of Multiverse, I feel I had better respond to your\nmailnote questioning whether anyone had managed to compile this\nsoftware - the quick answer is yes! The long answer is yes - but a\nfew have had a few problems with their platforms - not all unix's are\nthe same, you know! As far as "many bugs" go, it would probably be more\nuseful to everyone (including you) if you were a bit more explicit! :-)\n\nPlatforms it has succesfully compiled and run on are: RS6000, Dec Ultrix\nSun Solaris so it is possible.\n\nThe main problem is that I don't have access to other platforms than the\nRS6000, so if there are portability problems then the only way I hear\nabout them is by people letting me know and giving me a clue as to\nhow to fix it.\n\nAs far as the software not doing anything, do you really think I would\nbother releasing it, if that was the case? Perhaps you didn't read the\nfew docs that ARE supplied. The dogfight world is made up of clients\nonly, so if you're in there on your own, then you're not going to see\nanything! The dactyl world has quite a lot of scenary - so if you don't\nsee anything there, then this is definitely a problem!\n\nOne final word - if you're not interested, don't bother with it.\nIf you are interested, then please remember that I'm not asking for\nany money! So why not try a little patience and constructive criticism,\nmaybe that will get results??

A very kind soul has mailed me this reply for the bugs in CView.\nSince he isn't in the position to post this himself, he asked me to post\nit for him, but to leave his name out. So here it comes:\n\nCView has quite a number of bugs.  The one you mention is perhaps the most\nannoying, but not the most dangerous.  As far as I can determine, it has to\ndo with the temp files that CView creates.  CView gives the user no control\nover where it places its temp files: it just places them in its\n"current directory".  The problem you mention occurs (as far as I can tell)\nwhen it runs out of disk space for its temp files. It seems as if CView\ndoesn't check properly for this situation.  As Cview decodes a jpeg, it seems \nto write out a temp file with all the pixel data with 24 bit colour\ninformation. Then, for 8 bit displays, it does the "dithering", again writing\nanother file with the 8 bit colour information.  While it is writing this\nsecond file, it also writes the data to your colour card. Then when it does\nthe last chunk of 8 bit data, it recopies all the data from the 8 bit file to\nyour screen again.  (It does this last "recopy" operation for its\n"fit to screen" feature, even when this feature is not enabled.)\n\n The result of this process is the following:\n  \n     1) If it runs out of disk space when writing the first 24 bit file, all\n        you ever see is as much data as it has room for, and the last bit of\n        data is simply repeated over and over again because CView never\n        realizes the disk has filled up and disk writes/reads aren't performed.\n\n     2) If it has enough room for the 24 bit data, but runs out of room for\n        the 8 bit data, you see almost all of the picture as it does the\n        dithering and writes to the screen card.\n        However, then when it finishes the dithering and recopies the data\n        from the 8 bit file to screen (for whatever reason it does this)\n        one again just gets a repetition of the last chunk of data for which\n        there was room on the disk.\n\nThis is just a guess, but probably fairly accurate.  At least the general\nidea is on track I think, although I have probably made errors in details\nabout file I/O etc.  The way around this is  of course to clear up sufficient\ndisk space.  The temp files for large JPEG's (1200x900 and bigger) can be\nvery large (3 Meg + 1 Meg ).  On some of the largest I have needed in excess\nof 6 Meg free disk space.\n\n\nCView has a much more serious bug: if you are trying to display a file from\na floppy, and you change floppies while CView has some temp file open on the\nfloppy, then CView in certain circumstances will write the directory (and FAT\ntable? I can't remember) for the removed floppy onto the newly inserted\nfloppy, thus corruptimg the new floppy in a very serious, possibly\nunrevcoverable way.  SO BE CAREFUL!  It is incredibly poor programming for a\nprogram to do this.  On the other hand, when choosing files in the Open Files\nmenu, CView insists on doing a few disk reads every time one moves the\nhi-lighter square.  Incredibly annoying when it could do them all at once\nwhen it gets the directory info.  And really, how much effort does it take to\nsort a directory listing?
: >over where it places its temp files: it just places them in its\n: >"current directory".\n\n: I have to beg to differ on this point, as the batch file I use\n: to launch cview cd's to the dir where cview resides and then\n: invokes it.  every time I crash cview, the 0-byte temp file\n: is found in the root dir of the drive cview is on.\n\nThis is what I posted that cview uses the root directory of the drive\ncview is on.  However, since It has so much trouble reading large files\nfrom floppy, I suspect that it uses the root directory of the drive the\nimage files are on.

I think you are too optimistic! PostScript is a very big language and\nso the fig format can not be able to be an interpreter of ANY arbitrary\nps code. The only program I know to manipulate PostScript files is\nIslandDraw.\nI for myself use xfig and include the PostScript files (converted to\nepsi format). Small changes then are possible (erasing some letters,\nadding text and so on).\nReinhard
I don't think speed has been determined, since it has never run on Intel chips.\nBut on the Amiga's Motorola Chips, it was one of the fastest true 'Ray Tracers'\n\nI don't think Impulse would port it over and not take speed into consideration.\n\nIn terms of features, and learning curve... ALL that you stated for 3DS is also\ntrue for Imagine, and lots more... But I'll have to admit that after 3 years of\nuse on the Amiga, the learning curve is very steep. This is due ONLY to the\nmanual. It is realy BAD. However, there is a lot of after market support for\nthis product, including regular 'Tips' articles in many magazines such as "AVID\nand a great book by Steve Worley called "Understanding Imagine 2.0" This book i\nis not just recommened, IT IS A MUST!
I would guess that it requires X, almost certainly DV/X, which commonly\nuses the GO32 (DJGPP) setup for its programs.  If you don't have DV/X\nrunning, you can't get anything which requires interfacing with X.
Am I glad you write that. I got flamed all along because I begged NOT to\ncrosspost some nonsense articles.\n\nThe problem with crossposting is on the first poster. I am aware that this\nposting is a crossposting too, but what else should one do. You never know\nwhere the interested people stay in.\n\nTo split up newsgroups brings even more crossposting.\n\n-- \n\nJan Holler, Bern, Switzerland         Good is not good enough, make it better!\nholli!holler@augs1.adsp.sub.org      ((Second chance: holler@iamexwi.unibe.ch))
I agree with you about the upgrade path; but I think I was fair.\n\nThe original posting complained (1) about SGI coming out with newer (and\nbetter) architectures and not having an upgrade path from the older ones,\nand (2) that DEC did.\n\nOn statement (1), I merely attempted to point out that all computer\ncompanies are constantly attempting to improve their product (& market\nposition/share).  In so doing, they eventually come to a point where they\nhave a new architecture, and the only upgrade path is to replace the\nsystem.  And the particular system he was complaining about was (in\ncomputer lifetimes) relatively old.\n\nOn statement (2), I felt DEC's history of providing upgrades was not far\nsuperior than the industry "average", and that, in my opinion, SGI's\nhistory is better than DEC's.\n\n(And what is DEC doing with it's MIPS based DECstation line?  Are they\ngoing to "abandon" it for their Alpha based line, or provide an upgrade\npath to R4400's and TFP's and R5's?)

#I use xwd/xpr (from the X11R5 dist.) and various programs of the\n#ppm-tools to print hardcopies of colored X windows. My problem is,\n\nI don't like xpr. It gives (at least, the X11R4 version does) louzy\noutput: the hardcopy looks very grainy to me.\nInstead, I use pnmtops. This takes full advantage PostScript, and\nlets the printer do the dirty job of dithering a (graylevel)\nimage to black and white dots.\n\nSo: if you have a PostScript printer, try:\n	xwdtopnm <xwdfile> |	# convert to PPM\n	[ppmtopgm |]		# .. to graylevel for smaller file to print\n	pnmtops -noturn |	# .. to PostScript\n	lpr			# print\n\npnmtops Has several neat options, but use them with care:\nIf you want your image to be 4" wide, use:\n	pnmtops -noturn -scale 100 -width 4\n-noturn Prevents the image from being rotated (if it is wider than it\n	is high)\n-width 4 Specifies the PAPER width (not the image width - see below)\n-scale 100 Is used because if the image is small, it may fit within a\n	width less than 4", and will thus be printed smaller than 4" wide.\n	If you first scale it up a lot, it will certainly not fit in 4", and\n	will be scaled down by pnmtops automatically to fit the specified\n	paper width. \n	In short: pnmtops will scale an image down to fit the paper size,\n	but it will not blow it up automatically.\n\nHope this helps.\nMarcel.
I have a Paradise SVGA with 1Mb, the 90c030 chip (1D). The docs say that\nI can display the following modes : 640x480x32k colours and 800x600x32k cols\nif I have the RAMDAC HiColor Chip. I have checked the board and I do have\nsuch a chip.

Instead of TV signal one can process any\n       other analog signal (including signals from slow-speed scanning\n       devices).\n       The controller has the following technical characteristics:\n       - memory volume - from 256 K to 2 Mb ;\n       - resolution when working with standard video signal - from 64x64\n       to 1024x512 pixels ;\n       - resolution when working in slow input regime - up to 2048x1024\n       pixels;\n       - video signal capture time - 40 ms.\n       - maximum size of a screen when memory volume is 2Mb - 2048x1024\n       pixels ;\n       - number of gray level - 256 ;\n       - clock rate for input - up to 30 MHz ;\n       - 4 input video multiplexer ;\n       - input/output lookup table (LUT);\n       - possibility to realize "scroll" and "zoom";\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       - 8 lines for external synchronization (an input using external\n       controlling signal) ;\n       - electronic adjustment of black and white reference for analog -\n       digital converter;\n       - possibility output image to the color RGB monitor.\n       One can change all listed above functions and parameters of the\n       controller by reprogramming it.\n\n\n              IMAGE PROCESSOR VS100

Good I had a bad feeling about this problem because of a special case\nwith no solution that worried me.\n\nFour coplanar points in the shape of a square have no unique sphere \nthat they are on the surface of.\nSimilarly 4 colinear point have no finite sized sphere that they are on the\nsurface of.\n\nThese algorithms being geometrical designed rather than algebraically design\nmeet these problems neatly.\n\nWhen determining which plane the 3 points are on if they are colinear\nthe algorithm should afil or return infinite R.\nWhen intersecting the two lines there are 2 possibilities\nthey are the same line  (the 4 points were on a planar circle)\nthey are different lines but parallel. There is a sphere of in radius.\n\nThis last case can be achieved with 3 colinier points and any 4th point\nby taking the 4th point and pairs of the first 3 parallel lines will be produced\n\nit can also be achieved by\n\nIf all 4 points are coplanar but are not on one circle. \n\nIt seems to me that the algorithm only fails when the 4 points are coplanar.\nThe algorithm always fails when the points are coplanar.\n(4 points being colinear => coplanar)\n\nTesting if the 4th point is coplanar when the plane of the first 3 points\nhas been found is trivial.
Recently I saw the latest Computer Shopper and in it there was an article\non nice shareware graphics programs. They looked pretty good and of the 6\nlisted in the article, one I had (Graphics Workshop), one I found via\narchie (Draft Choice - old version though) and the rest I couldn't find.\nSo if there is anyone that knows where I can get the following programs\nvia anonymous ftp, please let me know.\n\nAdkins Graphics :AG1.ZIP, AG2.ZIP\nDraft Choice (latest VGA version) : DRAFTC.ZIP\nEnvision Publisher: ENVIS1.ZIP, ENVIS2.ZIP\nNeopaint: NEOPNT.ZIP\n\nThanx in advance.\nD.PETRO

Hi Everyone ::\n\nI am  looking for  some software  called SHADOW as \nfar as  I know  its a   simple  raytracer  used in\nthe  visualization  of  synchrotron   beam  lines.\nNow we have  an  old  version of the  program here\n,but unfortunately we don't have any documentation\nif anyone knows  where I  can  get  some  docs, or\nmaybe  a  newer  version  of  the program or  even \nanother  program that does the same sort of  thing\nI would love to hear from you.\n\nPS I think SHADOW was written by a F Cerrina?\n\nAnyone any ideas?
Hi,\n\n  I'm looking for an algorithm that would generate a good cross-section of\nRGB colours given a limited colour map size. \n\nThe problem: I'm writing an application for the PC that may have at most 256\ncolors. I want to use one colormap (palette) for the application but I'd like\nit to contain an even spread of colours of the visible spectrum. I could use \na 6x6x6 RGB cube but the problem is that a lot of those colours are almost\nidentical to the human eye.
Could anyone direct me to the FTP site where I can find the DOS-based\nmorphing package called DMORF12.ZIP?  I had downloaded this file last week,\nbut the new DOS 6 crashed my hard drive and I lost it. Now I can't find the\nsite where I got it from.......\n\nAlso, are there any other morphing packages out for DOS (freeware or shareware)\n\n\nThanks in advance,\nBarry\n\n/---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\___________________________________________________________________________/\n--

If this question is covered elsewhere, I apologize, but I need information\nfast.\n\nMy department has been given a large sum of money to install a video system\non our network of IBM RS6000 workstations.  This is not an area in which I\nhave any expertise, so I wonder if anyone out there can offer advice.  We\nwould like a system, based either on VHS or 8mm video which will allow one \nwrite video, frame by frame on tape for play-back in real time.  It's for\nvisualization of physics problems.  Can anyone tell me what hardware is\navailable which would work for our system?  Some support software is\nobviously needed too, but nothing particularly sophisticated, since the\nsoftware we actually use for the visualization is all already written.\n\nPlease email with replies, as I don't read this group.  Many thanks for your\nhelp.

I have a Diamond Speedstar 24X board that I want to program\nfor 24 bit 640x480 graphics, or possibly 800x600 16 bit color.\nDoes anybody have any libraries supporting these modes on this\nboard? Even somes simple routines to set the graphics mode and\nplot individual pixels would be a great help. I plan to use the\nroutines with djgp.\n\n   Thanks in advance. Please respond also via e-mail.
Hi,\n\nCan anybody suggest robust algorithms/code for computing the point of intersection\non n, 2-d lines in a plane. The data has outliers and hence a simple least squares\ntechnique does not seem to provide satifactory results.\n\nPlease respond by e-mail and I will post the summary to the newsgroups\nif there is sufficient interest.\n\nThanks,\n\nRaj Talluri\nMember Technical Staff\nImage Understanding Branch\nTexas Instruments\nCentral Research Labs\nDallas, Texas 75248
Nope, this won't work for a cylinder. You can have a line arbitrarily close\nto the the cylinder backbone, and yet not intersect it. The test works for a\npillbox, though. (a cylinder with two hemispheres attached at the ends.)\n\n\n-arun
On a related topic, I have been searching (with no success)\nfor a specification of the Enhanced Metafile format.  I have\nthe original WMF format (Graphics File Formats, Levine et al),\nbut no info on the 32 bit version.\n\nAny pointers ?
Is there a precompiled version of hp2xx for DOS out there - prefereably\nfor 386/486?
Does anybody have an algorithm for "flattening" out a globe, or any other\nparametric surface, that is definied parametrically. \nThat is, I would like to take a sheet of paper and a knife and to be\nable to calculate how I must cut in the paper so I can fold it to a\nglobe (or any other object).
I have a routine that changes the color (RGB) attributes on my\nVGA adapter, but it doesn't work in the mode that I need.  \nSpecifically 68 hex.  An obscure mode, of course, but I need to\nchange the zillions of colors to 64 shade greyscale, but I do\nnot have the correct memory address for the pointer I need.\n\nPLEASE, someone, I need the starting address, or maybe somewhere \nI can find it.  Thank you.
re: majority of users not readding from floppy.\nWell, how about those of us who have 1400-picture CD-ROMS and would like to use\nCVIEW because it is fast and it works well, but can't because the moron lacked\nthe foresight to create the temp file in the program's path, not the current\ndidrectory?
The equation of the sphere through the 4 points (x1,y1,z1),...,(x4,y4,z4) is\n  | x^2+y^2+z^2  x1^2+y1^2+z1^2  ...  x4^2+y4^2+z4^2 |\n  |      x             x1        ...        x4       |\n  |      y             y1        ...        y4       | = 0\n  |      z             z1        ...        z4       |\n  |      1             1         ...        1        |\nWhen this 5 by 5 determininant is expanded on its first column you get the\nequation in the form\n  A(x^2+y^2+z^2) + Bx + Cy + Dz + E = 0\nIf you need the center and radius, jyst divide through by A (it cannot be\nzero if the 4 given points form a non-degenerate tetrahedron) and complete\nthe square on x, y, and z to obtain\n  (x-xc)^2 + (y-yc)^2 + (z-zc)^2 = r^2
The idea is to clip one polygon using another polygon (not\nnecessarily rectangular) as a window.  My problem then is in\nfinding out all the new vertices of the resulting "subpolygons"\nfrom the first one.  Is this simply a matter of extending the\nusual algorithm whereby each of the edges of one polygon is checked\nagainst another polygon???  Is there a simpler way??\n\nComments welcome.
I've recently got hold of a PC with an S3 card in it, and I'd like to do some\nC programming with it, are there any libraries out there that will let me\naccess the high resolution modes available via Borland Turbo C?
I am writing some utilies to convert Regis and Tektonic esacpe sequences  \ninto some useful formats. I would rather not have to goto a bitmap format.  \nI can convert them to Window Meta FIles easily enough, but I would rather  \nconvert them to Corel Draw, .CDR, or MS Power Point, .PPT, files.  \nMicrosoft would not give me the format. I was wondering if anybody out  \nthere knows the formats for these two applications.
The most ridiculous example of VR-exploitation I've seen so far is the\n"Virtual Reality Clothing Company" which recently opened up in Vancouver. As\nfar as I can tell it's just another "chic" clothes spot. Although it would be\ninteresting if they were selling "virtual clothing"....\n\nE-mail me if you want me to dig up their phone # and you can probably get\nsome promotional lit.
