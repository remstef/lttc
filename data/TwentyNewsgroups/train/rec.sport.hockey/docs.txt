I think that NHLPA' 93 is the best video game available now.\nof course many things could be done better, but i really appreciate that\nthe names of players are the real ones, no matter if it lacks some logos...\nI am still playing it since November leading different teams to the finals\nand making scorers from the same team compete for the top scoring:\nYesterday I won the title using Toronto against Hartford (4 games to two),\nI played the playoffs in a 7 games fashion (5 minutes for each period) and\nthe best scorer and shooter was Gilmour (116 shots if I remember well)\n-- \n_____________________________________________________\n\n  Iskander AYARI
I have one complaint for the cameramen doing the Jersey-Pitt series:  Show\nthe shots, not the hits.  On more than one occassion the camera zoomed in\non a check along the boards while the puck was in the slot.  They panned\nback to show the rebound.  Maybe Mom's camera people were a little more \nexperienced.

If I'm not mistaken, San Jose had more wins than Ottawa. First tiebreaker in\nthe NHL is always most wins.
I think that Mike Foligno was the captain of the Sabres when he\ngot traded to the Leafs. Also, wasn't Rick Vaive the captain of\nthe Leafs when he got traded to Chicago (with Steve Thomas for\nEd Olcyzk and someone). Speaking of the Leafs, I believe that\nDarryl Sittler was their captain (he'd torn the "C" off his\njersey but I think he re-claimed the captaincy later on) when he\nwas traded to the Flyers.\n\nOh yeah, of course, Gretzky was the captain of the Oilers before\nhe was traded wasn't he?
What's the deal?  c.s.h. has nothing on it yet.  Is it in OT, is it over,\nwhat?  I want to know!  We all want to know!  Where's Roger when you need\nhim?!?!?!?!  :-)\n\n--\n    Keith Keller				LET'S GO RANGERS!!!!!\n						LET'S GO QUAKERS!!!!!\n	kkeller@mail.sas.upenn.edu		IVY LEAGUE CHAMPS!!!!
Punch Imlach's contributions as a coach and GM were far greater than\nthose of the above combined.  Should we name a division or trophy after\nhim?  Smythe and Norris and the bunch were honoured purely because they\nwere powerful owners.  As owners they certainly did help to build the\nleague but whether they developed the game is another question altogether.\nAre we going to honour those who contributed to the league's evolution\nor are we going to honour those who contributed to the glory of the \nsport itself?   \n\n\nI can't disagree with you here.\n\n\n\nWhat have you heard?  The Major was the *definitive* little asshole!  He\noriginated the phrase "if you can't beat 'em in the alley you can't beat\n'em on the ice."  That was his idea of hockey.  Do you think, by chance,\nthat Don Cherry is a classy individual?\n\n\nThe money issue is irrelevant to the point that we would agree on, and\nthat is: "it is the players that are what make the game great and not the\npeople who put them on the ice"\n\nExactly true.  Naming divisions and trophies after Smythe and the bunch\nis the same kind of nepotism that put Stein in the hall of fame.  I have\nalways thought that this was nonsense.\n\n\n--
There is really nothing inherently wrong with it but they tried it just\na little over a decade ago, and noone showed up for the early rounds in\nthe playoffs...whereas soon after they went to the divisional set-up\narenas were mostly filled in the early rounds.  \n\nThe empirical evidence of the last two decades is that more people will\nshow up to see the Bruins play the Sabre umpteen times than see the\nBruins play the Captials in the first round.\n\nMaybe hockey has increased in popularity sufficiently that this will\nno longer be the case.  The experiment is worthwhile with the uneven\ndistribution of the expansion teams, but I prefer the divisional \nplayoff.
No.  Patrick Roy is the reason the game was lost, and Ron Hextall is the\nreason Quebec won.  Everybody said it would come down to goaltending, that\ngoaltending was the key, etc etc.  Well, the key doesn't quite fit if you're\nMontreal.  The Dionne penalty was kind of a cheesy call, but let's face it;\nhe literally left his feet to throw an elbow.  Blaming Stewart is just an\nexcuse to avoid facing the fact that Roy allowed what was one of the worst\ngoals he could possibly allow.  He even saw the whole shot, dammit.  Besides,\nStewart evened things up a bit by calling a Quebec penalty in OT.\n\nMontreal played a solid game (although they still don't know how to clear\ntraffic in front of the net; the loss of Schneider will hurt even more). \nNormally I would say that any team that blows a 2-goal lead with less than \nfive, let alone two, minutes to go in regulation time IN A PLAYOFF GAME \nESPECIALLY needs to be smacked upside their collective heads.  But I don't\nthink this was a team loss (although Keane should have been able to clear \nthe zone just prior to the first Quebec goal).  Roy is paid big money to \nplay.  He looked like a player in an industrial league on Sakic's shot.\n\nDemers should start Racicot in the next game.  If not that, he should let\nthe damn team read the papers for the next day or two....and maybe this\narticle, if possible.\n\n\nI didn't think the wrap-around was as bad as the second goal.  I also didn't\nthink Scott Young should have gotten around the defender (can't remember who)\nin the first place.  But you are correct, it shouldn't have gone in\nregardless.\n\n\nYep.  Moog looked bad on Mogilny's goal with five seconds left in the second,\nIMO.  How about Neely though?   Holy shit, what a player.\n\nSpeaking of great players, man-oh-man can Quebec skate.  I haven't seen a\nteam so potent on the rush in a long time.  Watching them break out of their\nzone, especially Sundin, is a treat to watch.  They remind me of the Red \nArmy.  \n\nBut I still hate the team.\n\nOn the rest of the games:  Didn't St. Louis' winning goal come on a\npowerplay?  Penalties will cost Chicago dearly, especially against Detroit. \nSame goes for Calgary; very, very undisciplined.  When Marty McSorely is\nwaving guys to the bench to *avoid* fights, you know something's up.  New\nJersey was overmatched, Terreri's heroics notwithstanding.  Mario is\nunbelievable, and Jagr for some reason shows up in the playoffs.  But I \nhate that team anyway.
I live in the desolate MidWest (as far as hockey is concerned) and our "sports"\nstores around here carry VERY LITTLE hockey stuff, except for San Jose, Tampa\nBay, L.A., Pittsburgh, and if you're lucky Chicago.\n\nI would like to know if anyone knows of any m,ail order, phone order stores that\nI might be able to get in contact with.  I am dying for some real hockey stuff\n(hats, shirts, key chains, etc.) for some other teams (Edmonton, Montreal, etc.)\nso if you have any information, PLEASE e-mail me DIRECTLY.  Most appreciated!\n\nGood luck to your teams in the Stanley Cup playoffs!\n\nGO EDMONTON (likely...NOT!!)  Maybe next year...\n-- \n	"If you assult someone you get 5 years--In hockey, 5 minutes.\n			Is this a great sport or what?!"
The Hawks win!!  Jermey Roenick scored his 50 th goal and the Hawks put the\nLeafs in their place, the losers column.  If the Leafs can not even beat the\nHawks in a match that had little or no meaning I will hate to see them against\nthe Wings.  \n\nOh btw I laugh at rm, that jerky!!!\n\nGO HAWKS!!!
Close Roger, but no banana, er avocado or is it artichoke ?!?\n\n	Geracie in the Murky News said Kingston will be the new 49ers\n	quarterback.  I'm still trying to determine if he is kidding\n	or not :).  If I happen to pound down enuff pints sometime \n	this week I'll go back and check what stooper idiot Purdy\n	said in his column.  That ought to be worth a few Leafs, I\n	mean Laughs.   If I'm really depressed I'll read the SF Comicle.\n\n	mark\n\n just say
Well, it seems that the Habs have been much talked-about of late, so here's my\n$0.02.  These guys have absolutely no concept of how to play in front of the\ndamn net!!!  Watch them in the offensive zone, especially on the powerplay. \nDamphousse or Lebeau will skate all over the bloody zone, maybe pass to the\npoint, get it back, skate some more, pass it around....BUT WHERE'S THE SHOT??!\nAnswer: the shot is totally useless because they lack a forward who stands\nin front of the net a la` Neely, Shanahan, Tocchet, etc etc.  Too bad \nDemers won't put Dipietro or LeClair on the powerplay more often.  Dammit,\neven Ewen would at least cause some disruptions.  Montreal desperately needs\na power forward with some talent, IMO.\n\nThen watch them in their own zone. Patrick Roy is screened on everything. Say\nwhat you want about his performance; IMNSHO he cannot stop what he cannot see. \nAnd Montreal's defence does a miserable job of clearing the front of the net. \nLast night against Washington Roy played a *great* game.  The first goal came\non the most ridiculous goalmouth scramble I've seen in a long time, and he\ndidn't have a hope in hell of stopping the shot.  The second goal came on a\ndeflection of a shot he only partially saw anyway.  Pathetic defence.  The\nthird goal was EN.\n\nNo wonder he gets pissed off at his defencemen.
Do you have a basis for this claim?  Try these stats (taken from Playboy Magazine\nJune 1989):\n\nPercentage of pro football fans who have attended college:    39.7\nPercentage of pro baseball fans who have attended college:    41.5\nPercentage of pro basketball fans who have attended college:  39.9\nPercentage of pro hockey fans who have attended college:      54.6\n\nPercentage of pro football fans who earn more than $50K:      34.9\nPercentage of pro baseball fans who make more than $50K:      22.7\nPercentage of pro basketball fans who make more than $50K:    27.7\nPercentage of pro hackey fans who make more than $50K:        44.0\n\n\nThe biggest advantage that kids from Boondock or Weedville have is the\navailability of ice.  In the San Jose area we have a population of 800,000\nand that population is served by 2 ice arenas.  In contrast, Kamloops,\nBritish Columbia has a population of about 50,000 and has 5 rinks!  There\nare also myriad ponds, pools, etc that freeze in the winter.  Down here\nit's hard to find a kid without a bicycle; up there it's hard to find a kid\nwithout a pair of skates.  And before you say "what does he know? He's from\nCalifornia." let me say that I was born and raised in Trail, British Columbia,\na town of about 8,000 with lots of ice in the winter.  My father did radio\nplay by play for the local team, the Trail Smokeaters, who by  the way, were\nthe last Canadian team to win the World Championship (back in 1961).  I was\non skates almost as soon as I could walk, and have been playing recreational\nhockey for about 35 years.\n\n\n\nLack of ice is a big factor, but costs is a bigger factor.  Both my kids play for\nthe Santa Clara Valley Hockey Association and this season, which just ended,\ncost me $75 per kid for membership in Hockey USA, plus $750 per kid for club\ndues.  The Hockey USA fees cover excess medical insurance, and the club dues\ncover ice time, officials, trophies, etc.  Other areas have similar fees, unless\nthe city government subsidises some of the costs, as Stockton does.\n\nBy the way; most ice arenas are located in what could be called the "inner city"\nareas.  Eastridge and Vallco are exceptions ... Redwood City's rink is in an\nindustrial area on Bay Rd, near 101, Berkeley's is near Ashby and Martin Luther\nKing, Stockton's is in Oak Park, Sacramento's is in an older section of downtown\n(I forget the name of the street), Fresno's is out on the edge of town, just west\nof 99.  Santa Rosa's is a nice rink, but it's in an older section of town.\nDublin's is outside of town, off 580.  Most of the rinks are old, and expensive\nto run, with huge electric bills and insurance premiums.  If you want to buy ice\ntime expect to pay around $100 per hour at any of these rinks.  Some of them\ngive you a 60 minute hour for your money; others give you a 50 minute hour and\ninclude the resurfacing time in the fee.

Local to the Joe Louis Arena? You mean local to Olympia Stadium, where\nRed Wings games were played until fairly recently (early 80s comes to\nmind). As far as I know, the rest of the post is basically correct. If\nwhat you meant by local was simply Detroit and I'm being incredibly\npicky, okay, sorry about that.
Showing a meaningless (relatively) baseball game over the overtime of\ngame that was tied up with less than 3 seconds left on the clock?\nGimme a break!  Where does ESPN get these BRILLIANT decisions from?
I AM an Ulf (and Pgh) fan, and what pisses me off about the whole Adam Graves/\nUlf Samuesson debate is that Ulf plays hard-hitting hockey (nothing wrong with \nthat) while Graves does what he does when the only way to win a game is to \nintentionally hurt someone (which bites!).\n\n\nI thought they had instituted all kinds of new rules this season to stop crap \nlike that?!?  Is it just me, or does the officiating just still stink to high\nheaven?  IMHO, if they could get rid of the existing refs, and institute a new\nsystem with more than one ref on the ice to keep an eye on the trouble-makers\nthen a lot of these things would stop, and then the game would be ruled by the\nfinnesse players:  Mario, Selanne, Bure, Messier, et.al...
In Detroit, the octopus is a symbol from the old days of the league. In\nthe era of the Original 6, four teams made the playoffs.  To win the Cup,\na team had to win two seven-game series - in other words it took 8\nplayoff wins to win the Cup.  The octopus (8 legs) has become a common\nDetroit symbol.  Every year around playoff time people start sneaking\noctopus (octopi?) into the Joe Louis Arena and throwing them onto the ice.
The FLYERS closed out the season last night with their 8th straight victory,\na 5-4 OT winner over the Hartford Whalers. The OT game winner came from Dimitri\nYushkevich, just his 5th of the season and his first game winner. The FLYERS\nnever led up until that point in the game. For the Whalers, the loss marked an\nNHL record 9th OT loss this season.\n\nRoster move:\n\nGord Hynes was called to to play in place of Ryan McGill\n\nInjuries:\n\nRyan McGill injured his hand in a fight 4/15 and was scratched.\n\nLines:\n\nEklund-Lindros-Recchi\nBeranek-Brind'Amour-Dineen\nLomakin-Butsayev-Conroy\nFaust-Acton-Brown\n\nGalley-Bowen\nYushkevich-Hawgood\nCarkner-Hynes\n\nDominic Roussel\n\nGame Summary:\n\nI didn't get TV coverage of the game, and since it was stormy in these parts\nI didn't have the best radio coverage either. Here's the box score followed by\na few things I did pick up:\n\nFirst Period:\n	Hartford, Nylander 10, 8:51\n	Philadelphia, Recchi 53 (Lindros, Brind'Amour), 19:59.8 (pp)\nPenalties - Verbeek, Har (holding), :55; Carkner, Phi (roughing), 13:53; Houda,\nHar (interference) 18:43\n\nSecond Period:\n	Hartford, Burt 6 (Cunneyworth, Kron), 2:00\n	Philadelphia, Bowen 1 (Eklund, Recchi), 7:09\n	Hartford, Nylander 11 (Zalapski, Sanderson), 9:38\nPenalties - Galley, Phi, major-game misconduct (spearing) :58; Verbeek, Har\nmajor-game misconduct (spearing), :58; Brown, Phi (tripping), 3:22; Zalapski,\nHar (tripping), 15:51; Brind'Amour, Phi (slashing), 19:50\n\nThird Period:\n	Hartford, Kron 14 (Sanderson, Cassels), 1:24 (pp)\n	Philadelphia, Beranek 15 (Lomakin, Yushkevich), 3:11\n	Philadelphia, Faust 2 (Brind'Amour, Roussel), 3:38\nPenalties - Houda, Har (tripping), 4:20; Hawgood, Phi (holding), 5:30\n\nOvertime:\n	Philadelphia, Yushkevich 5 (Faust), 1:15.\nPenalties - None\n\nPower Play:\n	Philadelphia 1 of 4, Hartford 1 of 4\n\nGoalies:\n	Philadelphia, Roussel 14-11-5 (30 shots - 26 saves)\n	Hartford, Lenarduzzi, 1-1-1 (38 - 33)\n\nOn the first Hartford goal, Gord Hynes misplayed the puck at the FLYERS blue\nline and Nylander stripped him and took off.\n\nThe Recchi goal was a 2 on 1 with Lindros.\n\nThe Bowen goal was just a puck he threw at the net, got a good carom and it\nended up behind the goalie.\n\nOn the second Nylander goal he got three whacks at the puck before it went in.\nThis is the most frustrating part of the FLYERS defense. Take the body, and if\nthey get one shot and beat you fine. Don't give them another chance. Carkner,\nGalley and McGill are all terrible about this, I'll bet money at least one of\nthem was the closest FLYER to the play.\n\nThat's all I have, my radio got bad after that and I was lucky to know who it\nwas that scored, much less how.\n\nFrom what I heard, Roussel had a very strong game. After the game, Gene Hart\nasked Bobby Taylor to pick the three stars of the season rather than of the\ngame. It was Garry Galley #3 for his career high point total (I'm surprised\nthat a former goalie wouldn't look closer at his defensive play), Tommy \nSoderstrom #2 for his team record tying 5 shutouts in only about 1/2 a season\nand, Mark Recchi #1 for his all time high team single season scoring mark.\nBut here's the odd part. He couldn't decide between Lindros and Recchi for\nnumber 1. If he picks Recchi as #1 after he had a hard time choosing between\nhim and Lindros, doesn't that make Lindros #2????\n\nWhat? You wanna know my three stars of the season? Well, since you asked...\n\n#1 Eric Lindros. Eric dominates a game simply by stepping out onto the ice.\nThe difference between the team's record with him and without him is no\naccident. I believe that the team could have been almost as successful without\nRecchi. There is no question that this team is significantly better with Eric\nLindros on it, and I think that he will deservedly wear the 'C' on his jersey\nnext season.\n\n#2 Tommy Soderstrom. 5 shutouts was second in the league to only Ed Belfour,\nand Tommy didn't have a Chris Chelios (booo) in front of him. He also didn't\nplay a complete season due to heart problems (sentimental edge here, my family\nhas a history of heart problems). There's no question in my mind that Tommy\nSoderstrom is this teams goalie of the future, and if Roussel complains again\nabout being number 2 look for him to be traded within 2 years.\n\n#3 Mark Recchi. Again, you can't argue with an all-time team high single season\nscoring mark. There are an awful lot of teams that didn't have a single player\nget as many points. Plus, Mark is the only FLYER to play the entire season.\nNot a tough choice.\n\nHonorable mentions: Rod Brind'Amour topped his single season high point total\nwhich he set last year. The difference was that he wasn't on the top line\nthis year and didn't get as much playing time. Then again, he didn't get the\ndefensive attention that he got last year from the other team either.\n\nDimtri Yushkevich was the teams most consistent defenseman. Yes, he made rookie\nmistakes, but he was usually fast enough to make up for them. I have a feeling\nthat with his shot he'll score a few more points next year without giving up\nanything in his own zone, and I suspect that he'll be the teams top defenseman\nin years to come.\n\nGarry Galley was the team's point leader from defensemen. Again, there are some\nthings you just can't argue with. And he battled with chronic fatigue syndrome,\nhe certainly deserves kudos for only missing one game, and that was against his\nwishes under doctors orders. But his defensive play often negates his offensive\ncontribution. A little more caution, and a little bit smarter in his own end\nwill make him a much more important part of the team next year.\n\nBrent Fedyk was the leagues biggest improvement over last years point total.\nBut consistency became a problem for him.\n\nA couple misc notes mostly for mailing list members:\n\nTom Misnik, a member of the mailing list, would like to exchange E-mail\naddresses with any list members who want to keep in touch over the summer.\nIf you're interested, you can send him mail at:\n\natt!ACR.ORG!TMISNIK\n\nThe FLYERS end the season 1 game below .500 in 5th place, their best winning\npercentage since going .500 in 1988-89. 14-20-3 within the division (4th in\nPatrick), 23-14-5 at home. They finished 17th overall, will draft 10th in\nnext years entry draft (Quebec had the 1st rounder, though). They scored as\nmany goals as they allowed, 319.\n\nThe 8 straight wins is the most since they won 13 in a row in 1985.\n\nI will be sending out final stats as soon as I get the issue of the Hockey\nNews that contains them, since there are no more games for me to go to I have\nno other way of getting them.\n\nI hope you've all enjoyed this years hockey season as much as I have. Knowing\nthe future that we have coming to us made missing the playoffs one more time\nalmost bearable.\n\nFLYERS team record watch:\n\nEric Lindros:\n\n41 goals, 34 assists, 75 points\n\n(rookie records)\nclub record goals:			club record points:\nEric Lindros	40 1992-93		Dave Poulin	76 1983-84\nBrian Propp	34 1979-80		Brian Propp	75 1979-80\nRon Flockhart	33 1981-82		Eric Lindros	75 1992-93\nDave Poulin	31 1983-84		Ron Flockhart	72 1981-82\nBill Barber	30 1972-73		Pelle Eklund	66 1985-86\n\nMark Recchi:\n\n53 goals, 70 assists, 123 points.\n\nclub record goals:			club record points:\nReggie Leach	61 1975-76		Mark Recchi	123 1992-93*\nTim Kerr	58 1985-86,86-87	Bobby Clarke	119 1975-76\nTim Kerr	54 1983-84,84-85	Bobby Clarke	116 1974-75\nMark Recchi	53 1992-93*		Bill Barber	112 1975-76\nRick Macliesh	50 1972-73		Bobby Clarke	104 1972-73\nBill Barber	50 1975-76		Rick Macliesh	100 1972-73\nReggie Leach	50 1979-80\n\n*More than 80 games.\n\nFLYERS career years:\n\nPlayer		Points	Best Prior Season\nMark Recchi	123	113 (90-91 Penguins)\nRod Brind'Amour	86	77 (91-92 FLYERS)\nGarry Galley	62	38 (84-85 Kings)\nBrent Fedyk	59	35 (90-91 Red Wings)\n\nThat's all for now...

Well, since you mentioned it...\n\n  \n\nNo question here.  Chip in the Masterson as well...\n\n\nYep. \n\n\nIf you asked me 30 days ago, I'd agree with you.  I now give the nod to\nRaymond Bourque; his play took off the same time the B's did.  Chelios\ngets a close second...\n\n  \nBarrasso finally gets his due, in a close one over Eddie the Eagle...\n\n\nIn *your* case, that bias is acceptable :-)... Mine shows with the Norris pick,\nso we're even...\n\nI'm impressed with what all the coaches you mentioned did, but my pick would be \nAl Arbour.  Not too many folks thought the Isles would be in the playoffs, let \nalone contend for 3rd in their division... Granted that they *did* have a little\nhelp from their cousins on Broadway... :-)\n\nAnd I like the Islanders about as much as I like mowing my lawn...
Here is a review of some of the off-ice things that have\naffected the AHL this year.\n\n\nST JOHN'S MAPLE LEAFS PROBLEMS\nThe St John's Maple Leafs sophomore season has been plagued by\nproblems. On-ice, the Leafs won the Atlantic Division title but\noff ice was less happy. A strike by public workers has forced the\nleafs out of the Newfoundland city for much of the last half of\nthe seaosn (since mid-Jan). They have played "home" games in places\nlike Montreal, Cornwall and Charlottetown. Their playoff "home"\ngames will be played in the Metro Center in Halifax, NS. One\ndemostration got violent. Workers attacked a Leafs' bus and\nrocked it and broke windows in the St John's Memorial Stadium.\nDespite the problems, Toronto officials insist that the Leafs\nwill return to St John's once the strike ends.\n===================================================\nSENATORS SOLD\nThe New Haven Senators have been sold by Peter Shipman to\nthe Ottawa Senators NHL organization. They are the only Canadian\nNHL team with an American AHL affiliate, and have made it clear\nthey intend to move the team to somewhere in the Canadian Atlantic\nProvinces. This sale and move has yet to be approved by the AHL\nhead office, but is expected to pass easily at the general meeting\nin May. The quote in the story from Jack Butterfield made it \nclear the league was more interested in the stability of the \nAHL franchise accompanied by NHL ownership, rather than maintaining\nthe 56-year history of the AHL in New Haven. \n\nThe Senators are currently in serious negotiations with Charlottetown\nNew Brunswick and are expected to move there.\n==================================================\nDALLAS HELPS HAWKS STAY IN MONCTON\nAfter announcing that they would pull their affiliation out\nof Moncton, the Winnipeg Jets changed their mind. \n\nThe Jets announced the move when they said that they would be slashing\ntheir minor league roster from 20-something to around a dozen; and they\nwanted to share with an existing AHL or IHL franchise.\n\nEnter the Dallas Lone Stars. Dallas agreed to supply the remaining\n6 or 8 players to the Moncton franchise. Thus keeping the Hawks\nin the New Brunswick city.\n\nThe deal is for one year and will be extended to three years if\nthe season ticket base increases to over 3000. The Hawks only sold\n1400 for this year.\n============================================================\nSAINT JOHN FLAMES OFFICIAL\nThe Calgary Flames have officially signed a deal with the city of\nSaint John, NB. The Saint John Blue Flames will play in the 6200\nExhibition Center. The Flames still have to apply for an expansion\nfrnachise from the AHL but are expected to have no trouble.\n=========================================================\nCAPS FOLLOW JACKS TO MAINE\nDespite rumors to the contrary, the Capitals will follow the Baltimore\nSkipjacks to Maine. The Caps' current farm team, the Baltimore Skipjacks,\nannounced that they would move to Maine and become the Portland Pirates.\nThere was much doubt as to if the Caps would follow but they announced\na limited deal with Portland. They would supply a dozen or so players\nincluding 2 goalies. They become the third team to announce a limited\nfarm team along with Moncton and the Capital District Islanders.\n======================================================\nAHL GAME OF THE WEEK\nIn early January, the AHL started a game of the week. The game, produced\nby, I believe, Pyman Productions, was televised across the Canadian\nMaritimes and northeastern US. The first few weeks saw two games of\nthe week, one in Canada and another in the US but since then, there\nhas been only one. Sunday afternoon and night games were covered and\nshown on Sportschannel NY and NE in the US and, I believe, Atlantic\nSports Network in Canada (but I'm not sure about that). I am not\nsure if playoff games will be covered.\n=====================================================\nUTICA GONE? SYRACUSE ADDED?\nThere were heavy rumors that the Utica Devils will not be around next\nseason. There were rumors that they might be headed to a midwestern\ncity and that the city of Syracuse is trying to lure them.\n=====================================================\nWHAT THE AHL MIGHT LOOK LIKE NEXT YEAR\n\nONE OPTION				ANOTHER OPTION\n			\nNorthern Division			Southern Division\nADIRONDACK RED WINGS			ADIRONDACK\nSPRINGFIELD INDIANS			SPRINGFIELD\nPROVIDENCE BRUINS			PROVIDENCE\nCD ISLANDERS				CDI\nPORTLAND PIRATES			HERSHEY\n					BINGHAMTON\nSouthern Division			ROCHESTER\nHERSHEY BEARS				HAMILTON\nBINGHAMTON RANGERS			UTICA\nROCHESTER AMERICANS\nHAMILTON CANUCKS			Atlantic Division\nUTICA (?)

Ok, but have you seen Tabaracci play yet?  In his two starts and\nhis relief effort for Beaupre, he has looked mighty sharp - don't\nforget the shutout.  I think he's let in just four goals over eight\nperiods of play.  I like Hrivnak, but we might actually have to give\nsome credit to David Poile for a change after this trade.\n\nHopefully if Tabaracci starts against the Isles tonight, I haven't\njinxed him.
RA>    Here's the point: there are far too many Europeans in the NHL. \nR> I am sick of watching a game between an American and a Canadian \nRA> team (let's say, the Red Wings and the Canucks) and seeing names \nR> like "Bure" "Konstantinov" and "Borshevshky". Is this North America \nRA> isn't it?\n \nI disagree.  I think the NHL should feature the best hockey talent in\nthe world -- regardless of nationality.  I have to admit that when I \nsee players like Gretzky and Messier traded off to the US because the\nCanadian teams can't afford them, I have been know to say (only half-\nseriously) that we'd probably be better off if we had our own Canadian\nhockey league for Canadian players! ;-)\n\nRA> I'm all for the creation of a European Hockey League, and let \nRA> te Bures and Selannes of the world play on their own continent.    \n\nRA> \nRA> I just don't want themon mine.   \n \nAgain, it doesn't matter to me -- Russian, Finnish, Mexican, Albertan,\nNew Yorker, black, white, korean, martian, plutoneon, ... it doesn't\nmatter.\n \nAny of them can put a Leafs' jersey on if they can put the puck in! \n:-)
I've had, and still have a few aluminum sticks.  I got my first when I was 15\n(a Christian), and broke the shaft halfway through the season, two years \nlater.  I bought another (a Canadian) at the beginning of the next season, \nand I still have it.  I also have an Easton, that a friend was getting rid \noff, after giving up the game.  I find that Easton blades are easier to get, \nbut all brands of blades are pretty well interchangeable.  Watch out for \ndried up bits of firewood, that some stores pass off as blades.  In my \nexperiences, the blades of an aluminum break more often than regular sticks, \nbut I've only ever broken one aluminum shaft.\n\nI like aluminum sticks.  The blades are quickly changed, even on the bench \nif you have to.  On the downside, the shaft won't break if you decide to \nimpale yourself on it :-)\n\nCiao,\nMark S.
As the subject suggests the Flames were not impressive this afternoon,\ndropping a 6-3 decision to the LA Kings. Most of the Flames neglected\nto show up, especially in their own zone, as the Kings hit at least\nfive posts! The Flames best line was probably\nSkrudland-Paslawski-Berube (which tells how bad the Flames were). Gary\nSuter scored a great goal (in fact all three Flame goals were scored\nby D-men - Yawney and Dahlquist getting the others), but also made\nsome bonehead plays. For the Kings, Pat Conacher was especially\nimpressive. \n\nThe games was VERY chippy, as Dan Mirouelli lost control early and\nnever recovered it; there were high-sticks, cross-checks, punches,\nhits from behind. Fleury got a game misconduct for rubbing out Warren\nRychel from behind. Flames dominated the game physically, but failed\nto take advantage due to horrendous defensive lapses (I don't think\nVernon can be blamed for any of the goals). Calgary went with 7 D-men,\nas Roger Johansson played LW; he looked lost IMHO - I hope King\ninserts Chris Lindbergh, Paul Kruse, or Sergei Makarov for Wednesday's\ngame. Gretzky left the game in the 2nd period with a charley-horse; no\nidea how serious - he didn't return.\n\nI still think the Flames should win this series, but they better\nbuckle down.

There are many teams in the NHL who have taken a liking to Russian players.\nThe "whole Russian strategy" is not specific to Detroit or to Devellano,\nwho was GM before Murray.  What the previous GM also did was to trade \naway several players who have gone on to do well with other teams, most\nnotably (in my memory) Murray Craven, who had a few very good years with\nPhilly after leaving here.  Also, it's not the volume of trades that will \nnecessarily improve a team, but the quality of them.  Trading Adam Oates\nfor Bernie Federko was just plain stupid, even if Federko used to be a \ngreat player at one time.  Most of Murray's trades have worked significantly\nto the Wings' advantage, with those that didn't being soured mainly by \ninjury to the players involved (such as Troy Crowder, who suffered back\nproblems from which he never really recovered).\n\nPut Scotty Bowman, Pat Burns, or any of the other better coaches in the \nleague behind the bench of this Detroit team, and they could beat anybody.
No no no!!!  It's a squid!  Keep the tradition alive!  (Kinda like the\nfish at UNH games....)

Not only that, but if I'm not mistaken Detroit scored 4 goals on their first\nfive shots on net...looks like Toronto's cream cheese run continues (or is\nthat swiss cheese? after watching Potvin I'm leaning towards the latter)
That's true, but according to your stats, Chicago has just as good a\nrecord as Toronto.  It's interesting that you should list Toronto ahead\nof Chicago.
Roberts played in last night game against the Sharks and got a goal (38th)\nand an assist.\n\nThis definitely bolsters Calgary's chances in the playoffs.\n\n\n							Rahim Hirji
Way back in the early years (~50's) it took 8 wins to garner the Stanley Cup. \nSoooooo, a couple of local fish mongers (local to the Joe Louis Arena, that is)\nstarted the tradition of throwing an octopi onto the ice with every win.  After\neach victory, one leg would be severed before the octopus found its way to the\nice.  (They are dead by the way.)  It was a brilliant marketing strategy to\nshore up the demand for one of their least popular products.\n\nHope this helps.
Hi.  According to my always questionable newspaper, there's a silver\ndollar being minted in Canada, the back of which commemorates the\nanniversary of the Stanley Cup.  Now, I know full well what coins are\nused every day in Canada.  I can easily fish a few out of my pocket\nchange right now, in fact.  My question is, since the loon is the only\ndollar coin that I know is legal tender, is this just a commemorative\ncoin with no monetary exchange value, or what?  Is it the sort of\nthing that only hockey buffs and coin collectors might covet, with no\nchance of it being circulated?  If it is an uncirculated coin, what's\nthe current cost and what's its potential value?  Just curious.  If no\none knows, I'll take this to soc.culture.canada and rec.collecting (or\nwhatever it is).  Thanks again
I'd personally prefer Buffalo-Boston, as a birthday gift from ESPN,\nbut I don't think the folks at ESPN will accomodate that for me ;-)\nESPN has this inexplicable affinity for the Patrick division, it\nseems.
boards injuring his shoulder and they blotted out the injury report.\n\nThe Wings player was Yves Racine, and he returned later in that same period.
Nice try Deepak, but "tough Whaler squad" should have clued you in to the\nfact that my Leaf woofing was tongue-in-cheek.\n\nIf playoff hockey is any more intense than the regular season variety then\nit is because the teams are facing each other at least 4 consecutive times\nin 7 days and hockey being the contact sport that it is, some things will\nbe carried over that might dissipate during the regular season.  But that is\nonly for some of the players.  Many of the rest, who have been playing with\ninjuries, who miss their families, or who, like Grant Fuhr, would really\nrather be playing golf, don't really give a damn.  Of course I can't say this\nfor sure, but I believe that this is fairly typical of human nature and I\ndon't think that hockey players are above having what I consider typically\nhuman attitudes.  \n\nWith the recent salary escalations the key players are actually losing \nmoney by participating in the playoffs.  The ones who regard the playoff\n"take" as some kind of a bonanza are fringe players who are unlikely\nto consistently be a force in the playoffs.  Now I know some of you are\ngoing to come back with "winning spirit" and all of that crap but these\nplayers are professionals after all.  While they may love to play the \ngame that love is entirely incidental to their purpose, which is, to make\na decent living. \n\nOf course, the coach is a professional as well, and part of what he is \nbeing paid to do is motivate the players.  So, if the coach does his\njob well enough the players may respond with a winning effort.\n\nThe second season, is after all, merely an exhibition.  The true Champions\nof the league are the division winners, the teams that come out on top \nafter the long struggle of the season.  The Stanley cup playoffs merely\naccord victory to the team that has remained healthy and "hot".  The \nemphasis on the playoffs, with their "sudden death" appeal has been promoted\nby the media and the owners with profit purely in mind.  Even if Pittsburgh\nloses the playoffs, we all know that they were really the best team in the\nleague over the year.  They proved it.\n\ncordially, as always,\n\nrm
A fine 26 year history came to a close tonight, as the Minnesota North Stars, \nor Norm's Stars (whichever you prefer) lost to the Red Wings by a score of\n5-3.  The Stars goals were scored by Mike McPhee and Ulf Dahlen, who netted\ntwo including the final one in franchise history, with less than a minute to\nplay.\n\nTonight, on the air on the Stars TV telecast, announcer Al Shaver, the voice\nof the North Stars, stated basically that he will not follow the team to \nDallas.  Shaver, when asked by his son (who was doing the broadcast with him),\n"What will you do now?" responded, "First I'm going to get me a new pair of\nslippers.  Then I'm going to sit in my easy chair and watch the world go by."\n\nThank you North Stars, and thank you Al Shaver, for 26 years of Minnesota\nmemories.

The Blues scored two power-play goals in 17 seconds in the third period\nand the beat the Chicago Blackhawks 4-3 Sunday afternoon at Chicago Stadium.\nBrendan Shanahan tied the game 3-3 and Brett Hull scored the game winner 17\nseconds later. Jeff Brown and Denny Felsner scored the other Blues goals.\nBrian Noonan had the hat trick for the Hawks, who also had some very good\ngoaltending from Ed Belfour. Blues goalie Curtis Joseph was solid down the\nstretch to preserve the Blues lead.\n\nThe Hawks came out strong in the first period, outshooting the Blues 6-1 and\ntaking a 1-0 lead on Noonan's first goal. Right after an interference penalty\non Rick Zombo had expired, Keith Brown intercepted a clearing attempt at the\nblue line and passed the puck to Steve Larmer in the right circle. Larmer fired\na long slap shot, and Noonan deflected the puck between Joseph's pads. After\nthe goal, the Blues picked up the intensity and went on to outshoot the Hawks\n10-9 in the first period.\n\nJeff Brown tied the game 1-1 at 3:12 of the second. Nelson Emerson broke in on\nthe left side, got by Craig Muni and pushed the puck across the slot. Belfour\ncame out to play the pass and shoveled it to the right boards, where Brown\ncollected it and slapped it in before Belfour could get back to the goal.\n\nTwo minutes later on a Hawks power play, Belfour stopped Rich Sutter on a\nshort-handed break-in. Chris Chelios picked up the puck and passed it to Jeremy\nRoenick who carried it on right wing and found an open Noonan with a nice pass\nacross the slot. Noonan fired it past Joseph at 5:30 for the 2-1 lead.\n\nNoonan completed his hat trick 3:11 later to increase the Hawks' lead to 3-1.\nStephane Matteau made a nice pass from the right boards to Noonan who beat\nStephane Quintal by driving to the net. Joseph had no chance as Noonan\ndeflected the puck in the net.\n\nDenny Felsner reduced the Blues deficit to 3-1 at 12:49 after picking up the\nrebound of Basil McRae's slap shot from the slot. Janney set up McRae for\nthe shot, and the puck sailed wide of the net and bounced off the end boards\nto Felsner. Felsner sticked the rebound into the partially open net. The Blues\noutshot the Hawks 10-5 in the second period.\n\nWith the Blackhawks leading 3-2 at 9:56 of the third, Stephane Matteau picked\nup a high sticking penalty. Just 53 seconds into the power play, Steve Smith\nwas called for slashing, giving the Blues a 5-on-3 advantage for 1:07.\n\nThe Blues didn't waste time as Brendan Shanahan scored just 23 seconds into\nthe two-man advantage to tie the game 3-3. Janney found Hull in the slot,\nand Hull fired a rocket at Belfour. Jeff Brown collected the rebound and\npassed it to Shanahan in the left circle. Shanahan beat Belfour from a sharp\nangle.\n\nJust 17 seconds later, Hull scored the game winner for the Blues. Nelson\nEmerson broke in on right wing, carried the puck behind the net along with\ntwo Hawks defensemen. Emerson made a nice pass to an unchecked Hull in the\nslot, and Hull beat Belfour to put the Blues up 4-3.\n\nThe Hawks had several chances to tie the game in the final minutes, but Joseph\nmade some brilliant saves to prevent the Hawks from scoring. He stopped Troy\nMurray point blank from just right of the crease with 2:30 left in the game.\nThe Blues killed off a late Hawks power play, with Rich Sutter clearing the\npuck with his hand as it was trickling along the goal line. The Blues held\non to win the game. The Hawks oushot the Blues 13-7 in the third period,\ntotaling 27 shots on goal for each team. The Blues special teams were excellent\nin the game. The Blues killed 6 of 7 Hawks power plays, and scored twice on\non four power play chances. The Blues ranked among the best special teams in\nthe league. They rank 2nd in penalty killing and 3rd on the power play.\n \nThe game was carried live on ABC, the first time an NHL game other than an\nAll-Star game has been shown on network television since May 24, 1980, when\nCBS carried Game 6 of the Stanley Cup finals.\n\nThe best-of-seven series continues Wednesday in Chicago and Friday and Sunday\nin St. Louis.\n\nBox score\n---------\nBlues 4, Blackhawks 3\n\nBLUES       0    2    2   --   4\nCHICAGO     1    2    0   --   3\n\nFIRST PERIOD\n\n   CHI -- Noonan 1 (Larmer, K.Brown), 8:17.\n\n   Penalties -- Shanahan, StL (holding), 2:28; Zombo, StL (interference), 6:00;\nMurphy, Chi (high-sticking), 11:30; Grimson, Chi (boarding), 14:39; Zombo, StL\n(holding), 18:46.\n\nSECOND PERIOD\n\n   STL -- Brown 1 (Shanahan, Emerson), 3:12.\n   CHI -- (PPG) Noonan 2 (Roenick, Chelios), 5:40.\n   CHI -- Noonan 3 (Matteau, Sutter), 8:51.\n   STL -- Felsner 1 (McRae, Janney), 12:49.\n\n   Penalties -- Baron, StL (interference), 4:33; Wilson, StL (tripping), 9:31.\n\nTHIRD PERIOD\n\n   STL -- (PPG) Shanahan 1 (J.Brown, Hull), 11:12.\n   STL -- (PPG) Hull 1 (Emerson, J.Brown), 11:29.\n\n   Penalties -- Shanahan, StL (roughing), 1:54; Matteau, Chi (high-sticking),\n9:56; Smith, Chi (slashing), 10:49; Baron, StL (roughing), 14:23.\n\nSHOTS ON GOAL\n\nBLUES       10    10     7   --   27\nCHICAGO      9     5    13   --   27\n\nPower-play Opportunities -- St. Louis 2 of 4; Chicago 1 of 7.\n\nGoaltenders -- St. Louis, Joseph, 1-0-0 (27 shots-24 saves).\n               Chicago, Belfour, 0-1-0 (27-23).\n\nReferee -- Kerry Fraser.

And of course, Mike Ramsey was (at one time) the captain in Buffalo prior to\nbeing traded to Pittsburgh.  Currently, the Penguins have 3 former captains\nand 1 real captain (Lemieux) playing for them.  They rotate the A's during the\nseason (and even the C while Mario was out).  Even Troy Loney has worn the C\nfor the Pens.\n\n-Jay
First,Happy Birthday,Val. Second, ESPN's affinity with Patrick has probably\nmore to do with the travel/production costs for a once a week NHN(National Hockey\nNight) affair.(ESPN-ABC owner,Capital Cities, is a company known for being\nquite thrifty with minimal overhead costs. It's quite possible that Jim\nSchoenfeld may be working for doughnuts :-).\n\nGary Thorne and Bill Clement are both NJ-based and the rest of ESPN crew\nresides in the suburban CT with a very close proximity to tri-state area.\nPlus,it makes sense in terms of solid hockey following in the NorthEast\ncorridor(PA-NY-NJ-DC/Maryland). Whereas,in the Adams you have only\n3-American based teams, out of which 2(Buffalo and Hartford) are not\nin Top-20  US TV-markets.
News reports in Toronto say that the Rangers are insisting that\nKovalev, Zubov, and Andersson play for Binghampton in the Calder\nCup playoffs, rather than return to play for their "home" countries\nin the World Championships.\n\n...shame on the Rangers.\n\nAnother black eye for the NHL in Europe.
The Ottwawa Senators fired Mel Bridgman at 1:00 PM today.\nRandy Sexton is gonna replace him.
Duh! He was making a joke about how long the Leafs would last in the\nplayoffs. (Y'know, hit the courses in the off season). Sheesh... People are\nso quick to complain...
People are seeming to be less concerned about Kariya's size as he leads\nteams to championships (World Junior and US College) and collects\nawards...everyone is watching with interest as to how he will perform\non left wing with Eric Lindros and Mark Recchi at the world\nchampionships.\n\n4 months of go...chances were not very good that he would go in the\ntop five...now it has become probable...a great world championship\ncould put him in the top 3 with Daigle and Pronger.

I thought the red light went on...thus, in the review, the presumption\nwould be to find conclusive evidence that the puck did not go in the\nnet...from the replays I say, even from the rear, the evidence wasn't\nconclusive that the puck was in or out...in my opinion...
What can you expect from a buffoon who said that the Pens should have\ndrafted Kirk Muller instead of Mario Lemieux?  \n\nPerhaps once upon a time Don Cherry had some insight into the game of\nhockey, but he's really degenerated into a parody of himself.
From where I come from in Canada, Borshevsky sounds more Canadian than\nSmith! -)\n\nAnyways, crawl back into the hole you crawled out of...the NBA doesn't\ncare where they get basketball players from, major league baseball\ndoesn't give a damn where they get baseball players from (except Cuba,\nthat is).\n\nCanada is in no imminent danger of being overtaken as the primary \nsupplier of players...Sweden, Finland, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia\nare all relatively small countries, and cannot really produce players\nat a greater rate than they are already producing them, and the\npotential influx from the former Soviet Union is severely blunted\nbecause the system has been raided and is starved for finances and\nwill take a decade or two, to recover and become a real threat, and\nthe US will just maintain its slow increase.  Canada should continue\nto supply 60% plus of the top hockey players in the world for the\nforseeable future.\n\nBesides we need the European hockey market if hockey is to take\nits rightful place besides soccer as the two predominant world\nsports...and since soccer is essentially boring, unlike hockey.\n\n\nCanadians are under no threat...the European numbers will soon saturate,\nif they haven't already...and by the time Russia comes online again,\nthe NHL should be a world league, and there will be many more teams\nto stock and many more jobs for Canadian hockey players.  In the near\nteam, the percentage of Canadians will mostly decline because of \nAmericans, not because of Europeans.\n\n\nCrawl into a hole and die...

Let's start over.  I'm not arguing about who is the better goaltender.  I'd\ntake Soderstrom right now.  What I am saying is that Roussel can be a #1\nnetminder.  The GAA difference is less than half a goal per game (less than\nthat after last night), their save percentages are close, and their records\nare similar.  And with that, I just don't see how you can label Roussel as\nthe most disappointing player on the Flyers this season.\n\nYou say Soderstrom played against better competition.  That may very well\nbe, but there is no way of knowing how Roussel would have performed in\nthose games.  Besides, against the better scoring teams like Pittsburgh,\nthe defense is more keyed up than they are against San Jose.\n\n\nBut I'm not just judging Roussel on that game alone.  I've seen him play\nfor the past two seasons in Philly and before that in Hershey.  It's just\nmy opinion, but I think he's got what it takes.  Of course, I thought that\nabout Mark LaForest, too.  But I never did about Wendell Young.  So I'm\nbatting .500 in judging Hershey talent since the Hextall-era.\n\nAs for the Rangers game, you can say he was saved by a mistake by the\noffensive player if you like.  But Rou had his leg in position to make the\nsave.  If he didn't, it wouldn't have mattered if the Rangers player didn't\nget the puck up or not.  It would have been a goal.  On a breakaway that's\nwhat the goalie wants to do, take away as much as possible and force the\nshooter to beat him.\n\n\nI seem to remember Roussel doing an excellent job against Pittsurgh on\nopening night to give the Flyers a tie against the two-time defending\nchamps.  And not to take anything away from Soderstrom because he was\nsenational in that game agains the Habs.  But you can't tell me that a\nMontreal player had an open net to shoot at some point during that game\nand just flat out missed it.  Mistakes, both on offense and defense are\npart of the game.  Or there'd never be shutouts.\n\nAnyway, I'm happy the Flyers have both Soderstrom and Roussel and\nI'm not going to argue about it anymore.  Besides, with the current\n7-game winning streak and expectations soaring for next year, I\ndon't want to piss you off to the point that you don't sell me any\ntickets next season:-).
How do you beat the Penguins?\n\n\nCrash the team plane.
Bowman tended to overplay Francis at times because he is a Bowman-style\nplayer.  He plays hard at all times, doesn't disregard his defensive\nresponsibilities and is a good leader.  Bowman rewarded him be increasing his\nice time.\n\nJagr can be very arrogant and juvenile and display a "me first" attitude.\nThis rubbed Bowman the wrong way and caused him to lose some ice time.\n\nThroughout the year, Francis consistently recieved more ice time than\nJagr.  Althouhg I have never seen stats on this subject, I am pretty\nsure that Jagr had more points per minute played that Francis.  When\nyou add to that Jagr's better +/- rating, I think it becomes evident\nthat Jagr had a better season- not that Francis had a bad one.
...\n...\n\nYeah...I've seen you're grand mother...I bet she could.
<discussion deleted>\n \n \n \nMY HOCKEY EDUCATION?  What the f--- are you talking about?  I'm\nnot even going to try to refute this absolutely insane statement. \n \n \n \n"I hate the Habs" ?...you sound like a 10-year old.  This\nstatement is just further exemplifies your total inability to\nargue objectively about hockey.  Don't give me this crap about\n"cogent arguments"...I've yet to read something of yours that is\ncogent.  You consistently argue with: (1) emotion; (2) huge,\nsweeping statements\n \nFrankly, you have a very unconvincing style.\n \nI'm not defending Bob Gainey...frankly, I don't care for him all\nthat much.  But your dismissal of him as something less than an\neffective hockey player is tiresome...it has no basis in\nanything.  How many Calders did he win? I think it was four (go\nahead and refresh my memory).  What about the Conn Smythe?  Was\nthat a fluke?  Yeah, not the makings of a hockey superstar, I\nknow, but try to have a reason, any reason, to shoot him down.\n \n \n \n \nHey cowboy!  You're the "expert" who introduced the idiotic\ncomparison of Gainey with Gretzky and Lemieux...you figure it\nout.\n \n \n \nHow many individual awards between them? Eight...I don't remember\n(once again, please feel free to refresh my memory...and try to\nbe as sarcastic as possible about my "hockey education").\n \n \n \nOH MY GOD!!!  Did I say that?  Roger...what's your point?  Fuhr\nis a goaltender, goaltender's don't "plug"...in his prime, he was\none of the best.  Sanderson was a scrapper...if you stick him on\nyou may as well include half the Flyers team of the same era.\n \n \n \nOh Roger, you shouldn't...really.  I don't deserve this...you are\nfar too accomodating already.\n \n \n \nYou seem to have allowed all of these other players fall into\nyour sweeping, vacuous statement...that's why.  If you want to\ndebate Gainey, go ahead...but why bring up everybody else?  How\ndoes it support your argument?  Do you have an argument, or do\nyou just like to throw around a few names hoping to impress us?\n \n \n \nGreat.  I couldn't agree more.  The Flyers won two cups for the\nsame reasons...deservedly so.  So what?  I don't get it.  Are you\nangry that the Leafs didn't get more recognition?  \n \nYou seem to think these pluggers are "hyped"...I don't\nagree...plain and simple.  If you're last statement is some sort\nof compromise, fair enough.\n \n \n \nNot a pleasant bone in your body, eh Rog?  Why are you so\nunhappy?  Not getting invited to enough parties?  What?\n \n \nRoger, why are you under the impression that responding to your\nposts is some great honour?  You really should stop...it sounds\na little bit pathetic.  Frankly, it's about as honourable as a\ngood fart.\n \ncongenially, as always, \n \njd\n \n-- \nJames David \nj3david@student.business.uwo.ca/s
The worst thing is that this is exactly what I did last year.  I had the Rangers\non MSG, and the two different games on SCNY and SCA on at the same time.  Yes,\nI'd rather have SC cover it, just for the amount of coverage.\n\n \n\nI think Thorne earns his money.  The best part is that he is the same way when \nhe is earning his $$ from SportsChannel as the Devils announcer (i.e.,\nunbiased).  He goes orgasmic for goals, despite which team scores, and even more \nexcited (if possible) for great saves.  He did a good job of explaining certain \nthings to non-hockey types without offending those of us who follow the sport\n(unlike NBC's clowns for the ASG).\n\n-JPC\n\n(Ob. Playoff-time flame-bait)\n\n      Don't any of you Pittsburgh fans tell me how Mike Lang(e) is better. \n      Maybe if he were a little spontaneous, rather than reading rehearsed\n      lines of B.S having nothing to do with hockey he would be better.\n\n--
I only have one comment on this:  You call this a *classic* playoff year\nand yet you don't include a Chicago-Detroit series.  C'mon, I'm a Boston\nfan and I even realize that Chicago-Detroit games are THE most exciting\ngames to watch.
From this account, it doesn't sound like you even saw the goal, Mike. Smith\ncame out from behind his own net and fired a breakout pass that hit Fuhr in the\nback of the leg. Fuhr was backing up at the time and never saw what\nhappened. The puck went straight off Fuhr's leg and into the net. Fuhr never\nhad a chance. There was no play back to the goaltender, in fact Perry Berezan\nof Calgary had just dumped it in and Smith was retrieving it. \n\nIt was unfortunate that it happened; Smith is a nice guy and was only a rookie\nat the time, and on his birthday too. But all the blame lies with him. Starting\nin pee-wee coaches tell players never to make a cross-ice pass in front of \ntheir own net. Too much chance of having it intercepted, or hitting the \ngoaltender, or whatever.\n\nAnd to the people who say that Smith cost the Oilers the series, I can only\nsay that he certainly didn't cause the team to lose the other three games.\nThere was no reason for a powerhouse team like Edmonton to be tied late\nin the third period of the 7th game of the second round. Everybody on the team\nhas to take responsibility for them even being in that situation.
Gretzky, Lemieux, Gilmour etc do not play the role of checking centreman.\nThey play an offensive role as opposed to a defensive one.  If they\nwere used as defensive centres it would be a waste of their offensive\nabilities. \n\nWhen you compare Gretzky et al to Jarvis, Gainey etc you are comparing \napples and oranges.  It is like me telling you that Felix Potvin isn't \nvery good because a team would be better if the had Lemieux instead of\nhim.  Sure Lemieux is a better player, but he is a different type of\nplayer.  For a team to be successful, they need to have all types of\nplayers- this includes defensive forwards.\n\nWhen compared with other defensive forwards, Bob Gainey is the greatest\ndefensive forward ever.  He is the player who's talents best suited being\na defensive forward- who completely dominated the game when he played.\n\nMaybe if a more talented player such as Gretzky had decided to waste his\noffensive talents and play defensively, he could have been a better\ndefensive forward, but he wasn't.\n\nBob Gainey is the best defensive forward that has ever played hockey.
: I have one complaint for the cameramen doing the Jersey-Pitt series:  Show\n: the shots, not the hits.  On more than one occassion the camera zoomed in\n: on a check along the boards while the puck was in the slot.  They panned\n: back to show the rebound.  Maybe Mom's camera people were a little more \n: experienced.\n\n\n\n: Joseph Stiehm\n\nExactly.  That is my biggest complaint about the coverage so far.\nFollow that damn puck!\n\n\n\n\n--\nRavi Shah\nshah+@pitt.edu

Here are the standings after game 1 of each of the divisional semi-finals.\n(Hey, look who's #4!)  I'll try to post the standings after "each game"\n(i.e. every two days).\n\nI managed to recover the email lost up to Saturday night, so all I'm missing\nis mail that arrived between early Saturday morning and Sunday afternoon.\nMany people re-sent their teams, so you may have received two replies back\nfrom me.  If your team name is not on this list, please resend your team\nto me and I'll see what I can do.

In the interests of saving badnwidth during this "heated" time of the\nyear (viz. the early flurry of "retard" comments coming from a certain\nstate whose name starts with P and ends with A), why don't you tell us\nsomething we don't already know?\n\nGeorge
After watching the Pengiuns all year (and as many other teams as\npossible), I've really noticed an increase in Tom Barasso's cheap shots\nthis year (and not noticed a corrsponding increase with other\ngoaltenders). I've also noticed that he usually gets away with it. Just\nas examples last night, I noticed him elbowing Scott Stevens in the\nhead, which basically started the whole shoving match that got Stevens\n(Scott) and Tocchet 2 minute minors. He also KICKED John McLean. Of\ncourse he wasn't called for that. Isn't kicking an automatic match\npenalty and 10 game suspension? I think Glenn Anderson got one a few\nyears ago for kicking Gaetan Duchesne in the chest. There's no doubt in\nmy mind that Barasso is the dirtiest golatender since Hextall. He's also\nvery good.\n\nHow about that Tocchet head-butt? Is there an automatic susppension that\ngoes along with a (non-kicking) match penalty? I can't remember anymore.
Pocklington just wanted to wake up the powers that be holding political\noffice, in Northlands, and in the business community that the Oilers\nwith their current lease arrangement are in a state where on a yearly\nbasis they will likely have an operating loss based on "normal" hockey\nrevenues and expenses.  That he did this was a good thing...it is better\nhe complain early, and make the city aware of a potential looming crisis\nbefore he begins to lose millions and millions of dollars...which would\ntruly jeopardize the franchise.\n\nPocklington's first option is not to sell or to move, but to sell\na minority share of the team (to realize some of the appreciated value\nof the team) and to get a better arena deal, either in Northlands, or\nvia a new building.  Pocklington probably isn't going to get exactly\nwhat he wants...but ultimately he will probably get enough, or will\nsell to someone who will probably get enough.\n\nThere are a lot of risks in moving a team also...\n\n...one has to remember "Peter Puck's principle"...it is better to\nspend other people's money than one's own if at all possible.
How can you assume it was a sarcastic remark?
CENTERS\n[...]\n[...]\n\nSanderson will be on Team Canada, but he'd be out of position as a center.\nAlthough he was drafted as a center and played there as a rookie, Sanderson\nscored 46 goals this season as a left wing.
NJ> : >And, while we are on the subject, has a captain ever been \ntraded,  \nNJ> : >resigned, or been striped of his title during the season? Any \nother \nNJ> : >team captain trivia would be appreciated.    \n \nMike Foligno was captain of the Buffalo Sabres when he was traded to\nToronto.
First, I enjoyed reading your post.  Second, I disagree with the Pen's weak\nspot being defense and goaltending - for a couple of reasons.  Barrasso has\nhad a spectacular year - no slow start, consistently sharp, GAA < 3.0, and \nleads the league in wins.  Tommy deserves the Vezina.  Given the lack of \nrespect he commands, though, I doubt he will win it.  The other reason \nconcerns the Pens' team defense.  They are hovering around 3rd or 4th in the\nfewest goals allowed.  That is a big improvement for them, and it indicates\nthat they are playing better team defense.\n\n\nWe'll see.  It'll be fun.
In the mist of the Rangers soap box (i.e. Captain neMesis-ier/ex-coach \nRoger Nebula bad blood bath) and with high hopes turned to new coach \nMr. Klean (Commissar Keenan)... I would like to know what procedures \nhockey teams use to select their captains (including A's). Are they \nselected by the coaching staff, do the players vote for a captain, or \nare they appointed by management?\n\nAnd, while we are on the subject, has a captain ever been traded, \nresigned, or been striped of his title during the season? Any other \nteam captain trivia would be appreciated.
You can't be serious!  I and many of my colleagues have not received any\nbad e-mails from Roger, in fact, Roger happens to have answered most if not\nall of my hockey questions and curiosities, so before you start flaming\nat me or Roger, better re-consider your nasty attitude towards Roger and the\nlike!
Well, Druce pretty much sucked when he was with the Caps. He had one\ngood **playoffs** (not season). oh well. The Caps are notorious for making\nstupid trades anyway, as can be seen with the Cicarelli and Hrivnak trades.\nSigh.\n	In another note... I'd have to say the Caps biggest surprise was \nCote, as many Caps fans had been expecting a lot from Bondra already.
It's in the FAQ.\n\nhave fun\ngak
Why should we pay your predictions any heed, considering\nyou couldn't even predict the proper matchups?  Maybe\nyou should try forecasting the weather instead.
Cool.  They sound like a cult classic.  Can someone post a address or\nphone # of a store that sells these?\n\nThanks,
If life were so simple!  Savard has not played in three of the last \nfour games and they are still playing like crap.  Montreal's problems\nrun deeper than Savard (and Mouton) unfortunately; I hope they can\nget their act together before the playoffs.\n\nThe line-up in their game coming up against PittsburgH is said to be\nthe one they're likely to use for the playoffs.  Let's hope they can\nforget about the nice weather we're having and play hockey.

Are there any further stories to report on the eve' of Norm's farewell \nfrom the twin cities? In an earlier post, it was announced that Norm \nGreen was given until midnight of the last home-game of the North Stars\nto cleanup his belongings and turn in the keys to the arena. \nDid this happen? Was Norm run-out-of-town?\n\nRumor has it that while he was attempting to remove the score board, \nthe score-board fell to the ice and flattened Mr. Greedy to a large\npiece of green paper. Arena management had to use the Zamboni (which \nthey confiscated from Norm's truck) to clean-up the useless remains.
What, did you leave the room each of the 100 or so times they said that\nthere WERE NO OTHER NIGHT BASEBALL GAMES? Every break they took back at\nthe studio mentioned it, followed by 'so...we're gonna show you hockey\ninstead.' My wife and I are hoping for rain at every baseball game they\nhave a feed for tommorrow night...\n\nPoint is, be glad they showed hockey, but if baseball was available\nanywhere else you can bet you would've watched baseball last night.
There was an article in one of the Toronto papers about this a few\nmonths ago...probably the Globe and Mail...\n\n...any ethical "journalist", even a sports journalist should not\naccept free meals from a team in any case, which was the one of\nthe points the article was making.\n\nAdmittdly, most sports reporting is mostly with any ethical\nstandards...
My votes (FWIW):\n\nTeam MVP: Pat Verbeek. He fans on 25% of goal mouth feeds, but he still has \n36 goals after a terrible start and has been an examplary (sp?) team captain\nthroughout a tough couple of seasons. Honorable mention: Nick Kypreos and\nMark Janssens. Probably more appropriate in the unsung heroes category than\nMVP, but Kypreos (17 goals, 320+ PIM) has been the hardest working player on\nthe team and Janssens is underrated as a defensive center and checker. I guess\nI place a greater emphasis on hard work than skill when determining value.\n\nBiggest surprise: Geoff Sanderson. He had 13 goals and 31 points last season\nas a center, then moved to left wing and has so far put up 45 goals and 80+\npoints. He now has a new Whaler record 21 power play goals, most all coming\nfrom the right wing faceoff circle, his garden spot. Honorable mention: Andrew\nCassels and Terry Yake. The kiddie quartet of Sanderson, Poulin, Nylander, and\nPetrovicky have been attracting the most attention, but Cassels is just 23\nand will score close to 90 points this season. He has quite nicely assumed the\nrole of number one center on the team and works very well with Sanderson. Yake\nbounced around the minors for a number of seasons but is still 24 and will put\nup about 20 goals and 50 points this season. Yake, like Sanderson, started\nperforming better offensively once he was converted from center to wing, \nalthough lefty Sanderson went to the left wing and righty Yake went to the\nright side.\n\nBiggest disappointment: Hands down, John Cullen. Cullen had a disasterous 77\npoint season last year, his first full season after The Trade. Cullen started\nthe season off of summer back surgery, and fell flat on his face (appropriate,\nsince he spent all of his Whaler career flat on his ass, and whining about it).\nCullen scored just 9 point on 19 games, was a clubhouse malcontent, commanded\nthe powerplay to a 9% success percentage (>21% with Sanderson), and sulked his\nway out of town. Worst of all, his 4 year, $4M contract had three years left\nto run, so no one would give up any more than the 2nd round draft pick the \nMaple Leafs offered to Hartford. Honorable mention: Steve Konroyd, also subpar\nafter signing a 3 year, $2.1M contract; Eric Weinrich, who showed flashes of\ncompetence, but overall has played poorly; Jim McKenzie, who was a much better\nhockey player two seasons ago than he is now; and Frank Pietrangelo, who only\nseemed to play well when Sean Burke was out for an extended period and he got\nto make a number of starts in a row.

No, Caleb, it's not the quality of ESPN that I have a problem with;\nit is superb, whereas it did not evolve beyond the point where ESPN\nleft off when hockey went to SC (this is excepting SC's use of feeds\nfrom CBC (-;).  It's the amount of hockey they're showing, or lack\nof it, that we're complaining about.  They had rights to two OT's\nthat could've been shown on Sunday night after baseball ... and\nthey had pickup trucks racing through oversized pigpens followed\nby Super-8 home movies of old car races (yes, I was checking in\ndesperation for Canucks-Jets) last night after SportsCenter.\n\ngld

1993 World Championships in Germany:\n ====================================\n\n Group A results:\n\n SWEDEN - CANADA  1-4 (0-0,1-1,0-3)\n\n 1st:\n 2nd: CAN 0-1 Geoff Sanderson      (Kevin Dineen)                  7:24\n      SWE 1-1 Patrik Juhlin        (Jan Larsson)                  15:23 (pp)\n 3rd: CAN 1-2 Geoff Sanderson                                      5:54 (ps)\n      CAN 1-3 Mike Gartner         (Greg Johnson,Adam Graves)     10:44 \n      CAN 1-4 Rod Brind'Amour      (Shayne Corson)                19:59\n\n            Shots on goal:    Penalties:    Attendance:     Referee:\n Sweden     10 15 12 - 37     4*2min        6,500           Rob Hearn (USA)\n Canada     10 13  6 - 29     6*2min\n\n Bill Ranford stopped 36 shots to lead Canada to a 4-1 victory in a very well\n played game.\n\n The first period started with a give away from a Canadian defenseman and\n Rundqvist came in alone on Ranford but couldn't put the puck over a sliding\n Ranford. Later on, Kevin Dineen had a great opportunity but Soderstrom \n played very well too. Stefan Nilsson had a couple of great dekes and set up\n Jan Larsson but again Ranford came up big. Period ended scoreless but the edge\n to Sweden in creating more opportunities.\n Second period action saw Tommy Soderstrom making a GREAT save. Mark Recchi\n made a backhanded cross ice pass to Lindros, Eric one timed the puck but\n Soderstrom was there to make a glove hand save. At the 7-minute mark, Canada\n started applying pressure on the Swedes. Sanderson-Dineen-Brind'Amour worked\n hard and kept the puck in the Swedes' zone. Dineen gave the puck to Sanderson\n who skated around a screened Swedish defenseman, came in on Soderstrom and\n made a wrist shot that went it by Soderstrom's far post, 1-0 Canada.\n The Swedes picked up their game after that, and Peter Forsberg had a shot\n that hit Ranford's post (the inside), went parallel to the goal line and out.\n Then Gartner got a penalty and the Swedes a power play. Jan Larsson took\n a shot from the slot, Ranford gave a rebound to Larsson who saw Juhlin by\n the far post, passed the puck and Ranford was beat, 1-1.\n Third period started as the other periods, Swedes having most of the pressure\n but the Canadians always dangerous once they were close to the Swede goal.\n At 5:54, Canada created some great chances and Arto Blomsten was forced to\n cover the puck in the Swede goal crease since Soderstrom lost sight of it.\n That resulted in a penalty shot, since a defenseman can't cover the puck in \n the goal crease. Geoff Sanderson took the penalty shot (his first ever, he\n explained afterwards), and he put it low on Soderstrom's stick side, close\n to the post. Excellent penalty shot to give Canada a go ahead goal.\n Canada increased the lead on a very suspect offside, Gartner volleyed a\n bouncing puck past Soderstrom to make it 3-1. The Swedes ran out of gas\n then and couldn't produce as good scoring chances as they had for 2,5 periods.\n The 4-1 goal came with only 1 second left, Rod Brind'Amour scoring on a\n rebound from Soderstrom, where the Swedish defense already had their minds\n in the dressing room.\n\n A very good game (the best in the WC so far?), with both goalies playing\n great. Soderstrom best player in Sweden, but Ranford even played better\n than Soderstrom, that tells you something about Ranford. Probably the best\n goalie in the world, were some comments after the game.\n Canada played a very disciplined defense, Ranford pointed out that it is\n easy to play well with a good defense. Lindros played A LOT and played well,\n Sanderson naturally game hero with two goals.\n\n The Forsberg-Naslund-Bergqvist line Sweden's best along with Larsson-Juhlin-\n Nilsson. Swedish defense played well, 197 cm 104 kg Peter Popovic had the\n task of neutralizing 192 cm 107 kg Eric Lindros, and managed this very well.\n Ranger defenseman Peter Andersson finally got to go to the WC, and considering\n that he landed in Germany just a few hours before the game, he played very\n well. Swedish coach Curt Lundmark was irritated after the game, partly because\n of the Swedes inability to score, and partly because of the linesman's mistake\n on the 1-3 goal.\n\n Lines information follows further below.\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n ITALY - SWITZERLAND  1-0 (0-0,1-0,0-0)\n\n 1st:\n 2nd: ITA 1-0 Orlando          15:47\n 3rd:\n\n Penalties: ITA 10*2min, SWI 8*2min\n Referee: Anton Danko, Slovakia\n Attendance: 3,500\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Group B results:\n\n CZECH REPUBLIC - GERMANY  5-0 (0-0,3-0,2-0)\n\n 1st:\n 2nd: CZE 1-0 Kamil Kastak        1:51\n      CZE 2-0 Jiri Dolezal       12:26\n      CZE 3-0 Petr Hrbek         19:10\n 3rd: CZE 4-0 Radek Toupal        8:28\n      CZE 5-0 Josef Beranek      17:07\n\n Penalties: CZE 7*2min, GER 6*2min 1*5min 1*10min game penalty\n Referee: Darren Loraas, Canada\n Attendance: 10,200\n\n The Czechs were clearly better than the Germans, and the German crowd\n showed their discontent by throwing in stuff on the ice after a while.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n FINLAND - USA  1-1 (0-0,1-0,0-1)\n\n 1st:\n 2nd: FIN 1-0 Jarkko Varvio      4:00\n 3rd: USA 1-1 Ed Olczyk          4:26\n\n Penalties: FIN 7*2min, USA 6*2min\n Referee: Valeri Bokarev, Russia\n Attendance: 2,800\n\n I hope some Finns can provide information from this game (I didn't see the\n whole game).

Don't kid around... They just might listen.
Sorry again.  I guess you need my address.
The French Canadian rule was an extremely short term feature when the\nuniversal draft was instituted in the sixties and only lasted for a\nfew years...and really didn't have any substantial effect during that\nperiod.  The Canadiens Stanley Cup achievements were earned on a\nlevel playing field.

IMO any good player should score on power plays because of the man\nadvantage.  Very good power play scorers tend to become overrated\nbecause their point totals are inflated by power play points.\n+/- tends to expose these overrated players such as Brett Hull,\nJohn Cullen and Dave Andreychuck.\n\nGiven the opportunity to play power play consistently, any player can\ninflate his totals.
Hopefully, a miracle (o.k. not quite a miracle, but close!) will occur and\nPittsburgh will be elminated prior to the finals.  If they make it again, \nthey will probably keep the Cup.  If they don't, it's the Hawks' turn!\n\nGO BLACKHAWKS!!\n\nCONGRATS TO JEREMY ROENICK FOR BEING ONLY THE 2ND HAWKS PLAYER TO POST \nBACK TO BACK 50 GOAL SEASONS!!
*This is what kills me:\n\n*******************************************************************************\nSpeaking of "die hard", that's what I did when I read this, died hard\nlaughing!\n\nToronto, to the Cup finals???\n\nFirst of all, has anyone on the planet heard of the team from Detroit?  Al\nMorgani (or however you spell the idiot's name) must be from Chicago,\nbecause on ESPN, he said "it's not even close--Chicago will definatly win\nthe Norris Division in the Playoffs, no other team is close."  Everyone is\npicking Chicago!  I don't get it, he says it's an "easy choice"?\nGod, Chicago was 1-4-1 against the Wings, and they won the division by a\npoint or two, followed closely by Toronto, who is also a good team!\nAs for the Leafs beating Detroit--doubt it, but even if they do, they\naren't going to get by Chicago.  If (even more amazingly) they get past the\nHawks, they would probably face Vancouver, and lose.\nAs for The Habs reaching the Finals, forget it.  Even I, as a devoted Wings\nfan, will watch the Penguins easily three-peat as Cup winners.  Lemieux,\nJagr, Tocchet, Stevens, and Barrasso, its a done deal.  Sorry Detroit, wait\ntil next year.\nBut hey, these were Paul's picks, and everyone has a right to their own\nopinnions, but the Leafs to the Finals??? Yeah. If they make it there, I'll\nwalk to Toronto to get some tickets, and that's a 700 mile walk!  \n\n--Ryan--
Nonsense.  I quite clearly state that it was Greg that made the claim\nthat Gainey never made an error.  And he made the claim. Read below.\n\nFrom rec.sport.hockey Thu Apr 15 21:22:49 1993\nFrom: gballent@hudson.UVic.CA (Greg  Ballentine)\nMessage-ID: <1993Apr15.160450.27799@sol.UVic.CA>\n\n[nonsense deleted]\n\nGainey is the best defensive forward ever.  I stand by that assessment.\nHe was a very good player who belongs in the hall of fame.  Did you\never watch him play? He never made a technical error.\n\n[more nonsense deleted]\n\n\nTo knowledgeable observers of the game my meaning is obvious.  Your\nhockey education is not my responsibility.\n \n\nHe was just another player.  To laud him as anything more I find\nbothersome.  I hated the Habs.  I hated Lafleur until I realized\nthat he was likely the most aesthetically pleasing player to ever \nskate in my lifetime.  Why would anyone talk about Gainey?\n  \n\n\nDid he play hockey at a high level?  Was he any good?  If not, why\nwould you bother to bring JC up?  I am talking about hockey players\nhere.  If you can't follow the conversation don't follow up.  As I\nsaid previously, it is not my responsibility to educate you.\n\n\nSure.  Two journeymen.  Big deal.  Neither one of them is worth\ndiscussing.\n\n\n\n\nThat is an excellent idea and if I decide to waste any more time\nresponding to any of your, or Greg's, postings then I will be sure\nto implement that very macro.\n \n\nTarasov claimed that Gainey was a "hockey god."  And Greg ate it up.\nAnd that is what this thread is all about.  If you didn't know \nthat then why are you responding?\n\nAnd as for "blanket disregard for these individuals", I can remember \nLeaf teams, purely populated by such "individuals", winning four \nStanley Cups.  Teams.  No one ran around telling us that George\nArmstrong was the best hockey player in the world.\n\n\nRight.  I had to get to the end of your posting before I realized you were \na complete joke.\n\nIn the future, if you are going to respond to my postings I would appreciate\nit if you could present a cogent argument supported by facts gleaned from a\nversion of reality that most of the rest of us would recognize.\n\ncordially, as always, \n\nrm
Why?  I'm calling this Penguins ... in 6.  Only that with the way \nthings stand, the only radio game at that hour is from the Devils\non WABC, 770 AM.  It'd be nice to have a Sony Watchman, but ...\n\nNo need to be paranoid, Robbie.  Don't judge me by my geographic\ncoordinates ...\n\nJets over Nordiques in the final ... 7.\n\ngld
True, coach Matikainen is ready to keep a spot for Teemu all the way\nuntil the medal games. He wants Teppo Numminen, too. And Kurri, but for\nthem the spots cannot be left open for too long. Esa Tikkanen we have\nalready. \n\nEven without these players I think we have pretty good team. Young,\nhungry, talented guys, no old players that have got everything (except\nthe gold). Yesterday's practise game, SWE-FIN 6-6, shows that the two\nworld's best hockey teams ;) are in prime shape.  The Finn line\nRiihijarvi(slightly injured)-Saarikoski-Viitakoski shined. I bet these\ntwo teams are the best in the NHL, too. Roger, Roger?\n\nWhat do you people think about Team Canada with Lindros, Brind'Amour,\nBurke, Ranford, Recchi, Dineen...? Can they beat the Finns:?\n\nCoaching news: \n\n	       Alpo Suhonen (ex-Jets) to Jokerit (now verified), \n               Boris Majorov (ex-Jokerit) to Tappara,\n	       Vasili Tichonov (ex-Assat) to San Jose Sharks \n                                             (assistant coach),\n	       Sakari Pietila to Lulea (silver team in Elite-serien)
........\n\nIt looks like the Edmonton Oilers just decided to take a European\nvacation this spring...\n\nRanford, Tugnutt, Benning, Manson, Smith, Buchberger, and Corson\nare playing for Canada.\n\nPodein and Weight are playing for the US.\n\nIs Kravchuk playing for the Russians...I know he had nagging\ninjuries late in the season.\n\nPodein is an interesting case...because he was eligible to\nplay in Cape Breton in the AHL playoffs like Kovalev, Zubov,\nand Andersson...obviously Sather and Pocklington are not\nthe total scrooges everyone makes them out to be...certainly\nin this case they've massively outclassed Paramount and the\nNew York Rangers.
Yeah, the news is true...the Leafs lost to the Wings 6-3.\nWish I could say I'd seen the whole game but my husband wanted\nto watch "Young Guns II" on another channel. Sometime between\nthe first time I tuned in and d saw the Leafs tie and the next time\nI tuned in and heard the score was 5-1, something happened.\n	Please no woofing from Red Wings fans.  They're my third\nfavourite team, and if they make it past the Leafs I'll wish them\nluck.  As for Potvin...well, it WAS his fist playoff game.
I think that they go to divisional records before goals, but I could be\nwrong, too.\n\n--\n    Keith Keller				LET'S GO RANGERS!!!!!\n						LET'S GO QUAKERS!!!!!\n	kkeller@mail.sas.upenn.edu		IVY LEAGUE CHAMPS!!!!
Not to mention, Mr. Francis is an incredibly nice person.  Over Christmas\nbreak, a friend of mine had a little Xmas gathering.  The two of us drove\nto Ron's house.  While I stayed in the car out of shyness, my friend went\nto the door and rang the bell.  Ron answered and my friend introduced\nhimself.  He then proceeded to invite Francis to the party.  Ron declined\nbecause he "had to watch his daughter."  He then reached out and shook my\nfriend's hand!  I know this isn't r.s.b., but I don't think Barry Bonds\nwould be this polite in this situation.
Really?  What makes you think the Islanders have a better shot?  They\ncouldn't even beat the Whalers in two games!\n\n(Well, since you're a Pens fans the whole question is moot.  I think\nthe teams most likely to beat the Pens are the Bruins, Nordiques, and\nBlackhawks but I don't think they can really do it.  :-))
It's only test message.
The last name is Niedermayer, as in New Jersey's Scott's last name, because\n(you guessed it) they are brothers.  But Rob Niedermayer is a center, not\na defenseman.\n\nI am not sure that the Sharks will take Kariya.  They aren't saying much, but\nthey apparently like Niedermayer and Victor Kozlov, along with Kariya.  Chris\nPronger's name has also been mentioned.  My guess is that they'll take\nNiedermayer.  They may take Pronger, except that they already have too many\ndefensive prospects.
TSN Sportsdesk just reported that the OTTAWA SUN has reported that\nMontreal will send 4 players + $15 million including Vin Damphousse \nand Brian Bellows to Phillidelphia, Phillie will send Eric Lindros\nto Ottawa, and Ottawa will give it's first round pick to Montreal.\n \nIf this is true, it will most likely depend on whether or not Ottawa\ngets to choose 1st overall.  Can Ottawa afford Lindros' salary?\n \nPersonally, I can't see Philli giving up Lindros -- for anything.  \nThey didn't give away that much to Quebec just to trade him away \nagain.  Not to mention that Lindros seems to be a *huge* draw in\nPhillie -- and that he represents a successful future for the \nfranchise.\n \nOttawa may be better off taking the 4 players +$15 from Montreal\nfor the pick.
There are ALWAYS scalpers with tickets outside the Arena.  You might have\nto pay a few bucks extra, but you can always find them.  Look on the\nstreet under the message board, or out on the street in front of the Hyatt,\nor even around Gate 1.  The later you buy them, the less money you'll pay,\nand during the regular season you could usually find some for near face\nvalue or below if you wait until game time.  Might be better to pick them\nup earlier now, though.
Actually, what I think has become more evident, is that you are determined to\n  flaunt your ignorance at all cost.  Jagr did not have a better season than\n  Francis ... to suggest otherwise is an insult to those with a modicum of\n  hockey knowledge.  Save your almost maniacal devotion to the almighty\n  plus/minus ... it is the most misleading hockey stat available.\n\n  Until the NHL publishes a more useful quantifiable statistic including ice\n  time per game and some measure of its "quality" (i.e., is the player put out\n  in key situations like protecting a lead late in the game; is he matched up\n  against the other team's top one or two lines; short-handed, etc), I would\n  much rather see the +/- disappear altogether instead of having its dubious\n  merits trumpeted by those with little understanding of its implications.\n\n  Brad\n\n-- \n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  Brad K.

Hi all,\n\nI don't get the sport's channel and I'm desparate for some playoff action\n(especially the Cannucks).  Does anyone know of a sports bar on the Bay\nPeninsula that will be showing hockey games.  I'm looking for something \nbetween redwood City and Mountain View.
Bryan Murray has done very little as GM...Yzerman, Fedorov, Cheveldae,\nChaisson, the whole Russian strategy was a product of the previous\nGM...Murray has made a couple of decent trades...that's about it...\nthat would hardly rank him as the best GM.\n\nWasn't Primeau, Murray's first decision as GM...
It is really annoying to see all of these\npredictions on the Net.  Who really cares\nwho you think will win?  Please stop with\nthe predictions, we all know the Caps are\ngoing to win the Cup, so let it go at that.
[stuff deleted...]\n\n  \nAs I recall, the author of the _original_ article that started the thread\nclaimed that he disliked the changing of the names for a variety of reasons. \nRoger, on one front you flamed him rather severely on the grounds that his\nwas a "jingoistic rant", but you also supported the name-changing on the\ngrounds that the current names are inappropriate because of the individuals\nthey represent. FWIW, I do not think the flaming was warranted, nor do I \nthink you enhanced what credibility you have with it at all.  Just an \nobservation...\n\nHowever, that aside, the real question is whether you like the idea of\nchanging the names based on the reasons given for it (making it easier for\nthe 'casual fan'), or whether you like the idea of unique divisional names\nbased on individuals who do deserve the honour.  IMO, the latter is a nice\nand unique touch that differs from other sports.  In addition, I do not\nthink that changing divisional names will have an effect on the number of\npeople that are interested in hockey, so it's a pointless exercise anyway.\n\nIf the current names are inappropriate, then that is a separate issue, not \ncentral to the original article.  Something to consider additionally is\nwhether or not players like Orr who 'contributed to the glory of the sport'\nwould have been able to do so _without_ an organized professional league to\nplay in.  In this case, honouring builders of the _league_ as opposed to\nbuilders of the _sport_ becomes a chicken-and-egg type question. (although\nit was the chicken.....)\n\n\nDunno if the Stein comparison is justifiable, since it doesn't look as though\nhis 'unanimous acceptance' to the Hall will hold up.
Well, here it is, NHL in the year 2000.\nI got these from a very reliable source in a dream some years ago and \nalthough I initially thought I had just been taking too many too strong \ndrugs now it seems the realization has really begun...  You can see the \nleague has already started to move to this direction.\n\n   *The Walt Disney Conference*\nAnaheim Mighty Chipmunks    -Franchise name to be changed after each new \nLA Kings                      hockey movie         \nLA Flames                   -We've seen some of that\nSan Jose Sharks\nSan Diego Bruins\nTijuana Red Wings   -Detroit's hockey team will follow its car industry...\nDallas Stars           \nHouston Oilers\nTexas Rangers\nSeattle Canucks\n\n   *The Norm Green Conference*\nAlabama White Hawks\nBiloxi Blues\nTampa Bay Lightning\nMiami Blades\nHelsinki Jets        -You've heard them starting getting used to the anthem\nMontreal Quebecois (sp?)                 -There will be no 'Canada'\nAtlanta Devils\nOrlando Penquins\nKey West Islanders\nHartford Whalers                        The Whalers will never move, huh?\nPalm Beach Capitals\n\n  Now that the Anahaim team is becomming real I'm really beginning to believe\nthe rest of the 'message'.  I'm sure the future will turn you into believers \ntoo.  After 2000 the NHL will abandond ice-rinks.  It's so expensive to cool \ndown the rinks in the subtropics and the locals hardly know what ice is \nanyway.  NHL will become a roller skating hockey league.  That way it can \ncreate more public interest in the game when local supporteres can play the \ngame in their back yards !
He's not gone yet.  The position opening is down to Polie and the\nSabres' GM Gerry Meehan.  I think I'd like to see Meehan gone...
The mission to revive hockey at UMass is now underway. At the  4 PM Saturday\nafternoon press conference held at the new Mullins Center Arena - former\nBoston College Asst. Coach Joe Mallen was awarded the 4 year, $85,000/year\ncontract as Head Coach for the UMass Minutemen. \n\nMallen was the third viable pick for the position, right behind Jeff Jackson\n(Lake Superior) and second behind Shawn Walsh (UMaine). Previous offers for \nthe position were rumored to have been offered to the asst. coaches of\nBrown, RPI and the head coach of the AHL Springfield Indians.\n\nUMass hockey was disbanded in 1979 due to financial constraints that had\nundermined the team's position over a period of years. In late November\nof last year, the $52 million Mullins Sports Center was opened following\nits one year construction deadline. \n\nThe Minutemen are slated to play an independent Div II/Div III schedule this\nupcoming winter before officially entering Hockey East for the Winter 1994\nseason. Mallen has yet to comment on player recruitment strategies or\npotential team candidates for the Minutemen - it is expected that he will\nleverage off his inside contacts within New England, the Bay State and\nEurope to draw on competitive, top ice players for the University.\n\nUMass has slated 18 hockey scholarships for the upcoming Fall semester ; \nexpect to hear more from me as I hear more from my sources.\n\n....

Here we go again. Is this the same idiot who posted the Gretzky\ntrade to Toronto????   Sheeeesh!  You should have waited until we got\nover that one before this garbage, maybe we would have believed it for\nhalf a second (NOT!).\n\n   By the way, I just heard from Mother Goose that Mario Lemieux was\ntraded to Winnpeg for Tie Domi!!!!!
What's with you stupid dorks from the "Western Business School"???!!! \nFirst there was that Cary asshole, and now you.  Don't you have anything\nbetter to do instead of being obnoxious, antagonistic little shits over\nthe network???  Why don't you just take a hike, and stop embarrasing\nyourself, your school, and Canada!
Roger? Lecture someone on not using smileys? What sweet hipocracy...\n\nKOZ
Never was?  Probably.  Is not now?  Debatable.  What other valid test can\nyou think of besides the final standings or divisional playoff winner?  What\ndo you propose, a worthless vote like they do in college football?  What a\njoke!\n\n\nIf I remember right, Brad Park was also involved in that trade.  He wasn't\nall that bad a hockey player.\n\nBut let's look at some of Sinden's trades over the years:\n\n??? for Rick Middleton (Rangers).  I don't know who Sinden gave up for Middle-\nton, so I'll call this one a +.\n\nBarry Pederson for Cam Neely (Canucks).  +++.  Any questions?\n\nGreg Hawgood for Vladimir Ruzicka (Oilers). ++.  Didja see that one Rosie\nroofed against Roy in last year's playoffs?\n\nCourtnall/Ranford for Andy Moog (Oilers).  A wash.  Moog is a good goaltender,\nRanford burned Boston in the Finals in his first year, and Courtnall always\nseems to get his points.  Anyone in Vancouver care to comment on Courtnall\nas a defensive liability?\n\nKen Linseman for Dave Poulin (Flyers) ++.  Any more questions?\n\nJanney/Quintal for Adam Oates (Blues).  ++.  Janney is an enormous talent and\na personable guy, the the Bruins play in Adam's Division.  Enough said?\n\nSo,even if you count the Esposito/Vadnais/Ratelle/Park/I don't remember who \nelse (Joe Zanussi?) trade as a double minus, Harry the Horse trader comes\nout on top.  I submit that the Bruins are always good because of Harry, not\nin spite of him.\n\nBTW, do you really think the Habs will bounce back next season.  I'll bet \nthey finish fourth or fifth in the Conference, behind any of the following:\nPittsburgh, Quebec, Boston, Washington, Islanders.  Someone correct me if\nthese five teams will not be in Montreal's conference.\n\nIn summary, things look bleak for the Habs, at least in the near future.  I\nsuspect that the next team from La Belle Province to win the Cup will be\nthat team that Lindros didn't want to play for.\n\n\n-- \nDan Lyddy    daniell@cory.berkeley.edu    University of California at Berkeley
Pierre,\nFor purposes of the tie breaker, you only count the first three games in\neach city. Therefore, Quebec cannot possibly be ahead of Montreal 4-3,\nand there's probably only one game that counts remaining between Boston\nand Quebec, which means Boston has probably already won.

Relying on Canadian tourists and transplanted Northeasterners to\nsupport a team in Miami is crazy; espaecially when you have really deserving \ncities without a team such as San Diego & Milwaukee.

I agree. It was great for the ESPN people to show the Detroit game. (My\nroommate just about sh*t when they threw the octopus on the ice. (Thanks\nfor explaining the significance of that BTW)) The only problem I had was\nwhen they blotted out the local commentators with the baseball ads and\nmusic. Especially when the wings player hit the rut and went into the\nboards injuring his shoulder and they blotted out the injury report. Other\nthen that, hats off to ESPN. Now if they'll only make a habit of this. Yeah\nright! Baseball seasons started (Zzzzzz.....) =)\n\nKOZ
More like Philadelphia making dust out of dead Leafs.\nRoger why do you continue to embarass yourself with your brash predictions?\n\nThey got whitewashed by a last place team.  Granted Philly is pretty decent\nbut the "best team in the Cambell Conference" would have beaten a last\nplace team.

Golly, I love stupid people. :-)\nListen, Rex, this is hockey.  The NHL, to be precise.  And in the NHL,\nthere exist these things called "ties".  A tie occurs when a game ends\nwith the score for each team equal.  Each team gets one point for a tie. \nThere also exits these things called "wins".  A win is when one team has a\nhigher score than the opponent.  (Oh yeah, only two teams play each other\nat a time, so I can say "the opponent".)  A team gets two points for a\nwin.  So, let's say that a team has a record of 38 wins, 36 losses, and 10\nties.  Another team has a record of 40 wins, 38 losses and 6 ties.  The\nfirst team has (38*2)+10 = 86 points.  The second team has (40*2)+6 = 86\npoints.  WOW!  They *both* have the same number of points, but the number\nof wins is different!  How did they do that??!?!?!?!  That's amazing.  So,\nRex, when people talk about wins being the first tiebreaker, well, then\nthat's what it means.  In our example, the second team would win the\ntiebreaker and therefore have the "better" record, even though both teams\nhad the same number of points.  If you didn't understand this post, Rex,\nmaybe you should go back and read it again, very slowly.\n:-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-)\n\n--\n    Keith Keller				LET'S GO RANGERS!!!!!\n						LET'S GO QUAKERS!!!!!\n	kkeller@mail.sas.upenn.edu		IVY LEAGUE CHAMPS!!!!
: you mention could cut it as stars in the NHL! Even "Rexi" in his prime was more\n: of a good regular in New York/Edmonton than a superstar in his own right,\n: although some blamed that on lack of effort on his behalf.\n:\nI think that the NY management made a mistake, and remember how Edmonton \ncalled Reksa in the middle of the season to win the cup ? Why did they call\nhim?\n \n: Yeah, we've had a tendency to beat ourselves in the past. I almost knifed my\n: brother in anger when Sweden scored two in the final minute of the WC \n: semifinals back in 1986:-) Or what about the three goals Antero Kivela let in\n: with five minutes to go against the Russkies in Lake Placid'80? Ugh . . . \n\nO.K., that was BAD luck. If Penguins have the same kind of luck this year in\nthe playoffs, they'll never win the cup. They are still the best team.

These players all are pretty good players.  They are the depth that the\ndynasties had to win Stanley Cups.  They tend to be the very good second\nline guys- who would be first liners on most weaker clubs in the NHL.\nThey were all important to their clubs.  Probably, several of these\nStanley Cup winning teams would not have won the cups they did if it\nwere not for the depth provided by these players.\n\nThey compare to Rick Tocchet and Ron Francis of the Penguins.  Very good\nplayers who can lead lesser teams (Francis-Hartford, Tocchet-Philly) who\nprovide the depth to the team that is currently best in the NHL.\n\nAs a defensive forward, there have been none better than Bob Gainey.  That\ndoesn't mean he was the best player (or even the best forward) the Canadians\nhad at that time, but he was excellent at what he did.  Gainey could\ndominate games with his defence.  He didn't need to get goals to dominate.\nHe shut down the opposition and was thus valuable.  There has never been\nanyone any better at doing this.  Not ever.

Actually, the way I understand it, it is an octapus.\nApparently, a number of years ago, a fan threw an octapus on\nthe ice and the announcer said "Octapi will not occupy the ice"\nor something like that, and it's happened ever since.  The fans\ncheer those who pick up the dead octapus with their hands, and\nboo those who use a shovel.
Sorry, Nelson, but you forgot to ask me. If you check the THN stats for\nKansas City, you'll find that Larry has been playing for the games, having\nplayed in 8 games in the period covered in the stats between 3/26 and the\n4/16 issue (1-3-4 with 13 PIM). Not exactly invisible.\n\n\nWell, having gotten to a chance to talk to him a few times, this isn't quite\naccurate. He injured his back (a disk injury) and did one stupid thing,\nwhich was to hide it from the Sharks and he tried to play through it because\nhe knew he was on the bubble. The Sharks then sent him to K.C., at which\npoint he disclosed the injury. Since he didn't disclose it, the Sharks and\nhe disagreed about the responsibility and he was suspended for not\nreporting. That was eventually worked out, the Sharks re-instated him as\ninjured and put him into therapy, and when he was able to play then shipped\nhim down to K.C. He fully expects to play in the NHL again, although clearly\nnot with the Sharks (hiding injuries is a stupid no-no, beyond just a\nno-no).\n\nVery nice guy. Always hustled his butt off. He disappeared because he was\nhurt. I expect he'll surface with another team at some point (probably\nanother expansion team), but is likely to be a bubble player for the rest of\nhis career. Has a good work ethic and is good at getting other players\nmotivated. Unfortunately, he played himself out of the Sharks future with a\nbad judgement call.\n\n\n\n\nAlways gave 110%, best work ethic on the club (except maybe Kisio), but\nhustle isn't always enough. His future with the Sharks was made clear to me\none night against the Flames when he went behind the crease and tried to\nhold Joel Otto against the board. He literally had one arm around Otto's\nneck and another wrapped around Otto's stick arm. Otto casually turned\naround and fed the puck in front of the crease for a goal, as though Carter\nwasn't there. Hustle can only cover size so far.\n\nThe Sharks have told me, point blank, that he's gone for good (ditto HUbie\nMcDonough). He was one of the favorites of the staff, but as one said to me\n"you have to make room for the kids". Carter, in fact, refused to report to\nK.C. and has been suspended by the Sharks. That might be a defacto\nretirement, but I haven't heard anything official. His only hope in hockey\nnow is the Gulls.\n\n\n\nBecause, at least from the games I saw him in, he was outmatched and looked\nfairly lost on the ice. I think he shows potential, but I didn't think he\nwas quite ready to make the jump to the NHL.\n\n\nAgreed (BTW, I still think a lot of your grades are more based on how you\nwish they'd performed than how they actually performed. I wonder whether you\ncan really judge talent from radio and television, Nelson? I know I have\ntrouble, since you don't see the off-puck action. your views from home and\nmy views from the ice differ in numerous ways)\n\n\n\nCoffee. Coffey is with the Red Wings.\n\n\n\nYou? Nah... \n\nHe was seriously unimpressive, even as a tough guy (his rep). However, as\nfew games as he had in a season that was at that point meaningless, I hate\nto judge the talent too quickly. Butn in Dody's case, I"m tempted to make an\nexception.\n\nBut I won't.
It is no matter what you call the teams, Jokerit and TPS, or Helsinki Tornado\nand Turku Typhoon, the best palyers in Finland would eventually end up in\nthose teams anyway, if they were in the "big" league.
I was under the impression that the objective is to find conclusive\nevidence that the puck _did_ cross the line.  And, the replays I saw showed \nfairly conclusively that the puck did _not_ cross the goal line at any\ntime anyway.  Somebody screwed up.
...\n\n\nWhy do you say this?  As of now, the Pens and Bruins have played the\nsame number of games, and given up the same number of goals.  They are\ntied for the third and fourth best defenses in the league, behind\nChicago first and Toronto second.  The Pens' weak spot is defense?  Only\nby comparison to their offense, which is second in the league to\nDetroit.  But the Pens are no weaker on defense and goaltending than the\nBruins are; that is, they are both very strong.
I am not sure about the tie breaker rules. However, I think if the Islanders win\n(Oh God, Please, Please let them win), the Islanders win the series against \nNJ and advances to third.\n\n********************************************************************************\nOf course no one asked me, I always interject my opinions on maters I have no\nconcern over.

How was this trade bad? I seem to recall Ratelle and Middleton making a pretty\ngood centre - right wing combination, and the Bruins also got Brad Park in the\ndeal (and they also lost Vadnais and somebody else). After the trade, the \nBruins were in two finals and one semi-final, all of which, of course, they \nlost to Montreal (which should please you to no end). I doubt, however, keeping\nEsposito would have made a difference in those series, as he did not for\nthe Rangers in '79 (or any of his years in Boston, for that matter).\n\nRiston\n-- \nRiston
Everyone keeps talking about European expansion by 2010 thinking\nwishful thoughts, but being totally off the ball.\n\nThe league format we use here is incompatible with that in Europe.\n(for those that don't know, the best teams from lower divisions get\npromoted and the worst get demoted).\n\nWould European fans put up with our "if you've paid, you can play" \nattitude??\n\nHow long would they support teams that are run on Ranger-based \ncorporate thinking (I use the term lightly).  (We don't need a good\nproduct because these duffuses in NYC would fill the arena for Ottawa's\nrecord every year......1940!! haha (sorry, had ta say it)).\n\nIf hockey (and other pro sports) had a similar system to Europe, maybe\nteams like the Rangers would be forced to compete (or get demoted the fourth \ndivision).  We'd have many more teams...centres that aren't as big (like\nHalifax or Adirondack....ok, so Halifax isn't a good example) would \neventually get promoted, and every team would be somewhat competetive within\nits own division (unlike Ottawa, SJ, Edmonton, etc.). Fans would eventually\nget rewarded for their loyalty (or penalized for their neglect), and the\nleague would be more interesting and dynamic every year because of the influx\nof newly promoted teams (and the Halifax Citadels win the Stanley Cup...I can\ndream, can't I??)\n\nLook at British (or any European) soccer as an example (they never have fan\nproblems).\n\nJust someone who thinks our system really sucks\n\nBarfly\n\n(feel free to flame me, my account ends today...hahahaha)
Has anyone heard what game ESPN is showing tonight.  They said they will\nshow whatever game means the most playoff-wise. I would assume this would\nbe the Blues-Tampa game or the Minnesota-Red Wings game...  Anyone heard for\nsure???
I was thinking about who on each of the teams were the MVPs, biggest\nsurprises, and biggest disappointments this year. Now, these are just\nmy observations and are admittedly lacking because I have not had an\nopportunity to see all the teams the same amount. Anyway....\n  \nMVP = most valuable player to his team both in terms of points and\n      in terms of leadership ("can't win without him")\n  \nBiggest surprise = the player who rose above expectation -- the player\n      that may have raised the level of his game to a new height, even\n      if that new level doesn't necessarily warrant an allstar berth\n      (includes those players who at the outset of the season, may not\n      even have been in the team's plans).\n   \nBiggest disappointment = the player from whom we expected more (e.g., I\n      picked Denis Savard in Montreal because with the new emphasis on\n      offence brought by Demers, shouldn't Savard have done better?)\n   \n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n  \n                        Team           Biggest       Biggest\nTeam:                   MVP:          Surprise:    Disappointment:\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\nBoston Bruins           Oates          D.Sweeney     Wesley\nBuffalo Sabres          Lafontaine     Mogilny       Audette (jinx?)\nCalgary Flames          Roberts        Reichel       Petit\nChicago Blackhawks      Roenick        Ruuttu        Goulet\nDetroit Red Wings       Yzerman        Chaisson      Kozlov\nEdmonton Oilers         Manson         Buchberger    Mellanby\nHartford Whalers        Sanderson      Cassells      Corriveau\nLos Angeles Kings       Robitaille     Donnelly      Hrudey\nMinnesota North Stars   Modano      Tinordi(not expected back)  Broten\nMontreal Canadiens      Muller         Lebeau        Savard\nNew Jersey Devils       Stevens        Semak         MacLean\nNew York Islanders      Turgeon        King(finally) Marois\nNew York Rangers        Messier        Kovalev       Bourque\nOttawa Senators         MacIver        Baker         Jelinek\nPhiladelphia Flyers     Lindros/Recchi Fedyk/Galley  Eklund\nPittsburgh Penguins     Lemieux        Tocchet(even for him)  Jagr\nQuebec Nordiques        Sakic/Ricci    Kovalenko     Pearson\nSan Jose Sharks         Kisio          Gaudreau      Maley\nSt Louis Blues          Shanahan       C.Joseph      Ron Sutter\nTampa Bay Lightening    Bradley        Bradley       Creighton/Kasper\nToronto Maple Leafs     Gilmour        Potvin        Ellett/Anderson\nVancouver Canucks       Bure           Nedved(finally)    Momesso\nWashington Capitals     Hatcher        Bondra/Cote   Elynuik\nWinnipeg Jets           Selanne        Selanne       Druce\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n  \nAs I mentioned up top, these are my *impressions* from where I sit.

Does anyone out there have the shorthanded goal totals of the NHL players\nfor this season?  We're trying to finish our rotisserie stats and need SHG\nto make it complete.
Pray for the Wings to become lazy and overconfident...the Wings\ncan only lose the series...Toronto cannot win it.  Take away\nDoug Gilmour and the Leafs are an old Tampa Bay.\n\nThe Leafs deserve a lot of credit for their diligent effort\nduring the regular season...but if Detroit puts in a reasonable\neffort, this is not a contest.
No problem, no offence taken ...\n\n\nIt is sad, just as a lover of the sport, that this team can be in\nthe metro New York area for over a decade and still exist as just\na non-entity ...\n\n\nWe're getting the Sabres-Bruins as the replacement game (and probably\nso are you) while the Devils-Penguins game is played on SCNY and the\nIslanders-Caps are the overflow game on the SCA (SCNY Plus).  If the\nSabres-Bruins ends early then we'll go to the Devils-Penguins game\n(assuming that ESPN follows their previous patterns; we got the last\nminute of the Islanders-Rangers and all of the overtime two weeks\nago).  ESPN's coverage started last night, by accident, but as one\nor more other writers have pointed out, they could've gone to wild\nhog wrestling for the evening instead ...\n\ngld

Are you comparing Cullen to Salami?  I would say that that is valid.  If\nWinnipeg is such a lousy defensive team then why the hell does Salami\nstand around the other team's blueline when the puck is in his own end?\n\n\n\nExcuse me?  Are the Jets playing .500 hockey?  Let me check...yes - but just\nbarely.  They have allowed more goals than they have scored.  Sounds an\nawful lot like Salami's +/- to me.  Sounds like they would be just as well\noff - or better - if he played the solid two-way game that our friends in\nFinland claim he is capable of.  But if he did that he wouldn't be chal-\nlenging for the league lead in goals would he?  The Bi-Planes might be\nchallenging for first however...\n\n\nNow let's see...you have compared Timo to Anderson and Cullen.  Who's\nnext?  Mike Foligno?\n\n\n\nSome of our Finnish friends who have watched him play claim that he\ncan play a solid two-way game.  I would have to say that this style\nof contribution would be more conducive to winning.  Or don't you \nthink so?\n\n\n\nI don't believe it!  You did compare him to Foligno!  (And I honestly hadn't\nread this far).\n\nIt would help if you used a little discrimination in your thinking.  Your\ncontributions would be more highly valued if we could see that you weren't\ntrying to be merely argumentative.\n\ncordially, as always,\n\nrm
Linares has not defected; as I pointed out, MLB requires that the player\ndefect first.\n\n\nWhat a surprise.  As long as the pool of talent is not accessible to all\nteams, MLB won't let a few teams sign it.  Seems perfectly reasonable to\nme.  \n\n\nExcept that MLB won't allow it, which is all I ever said.
At least we got somebody the Flyers wanted ;-)\n\nIs this really true?  I have not been keeping up with any news.  If it is,\nwhat's the deal with Neil Smith?  Is he gone, too?\n\n--\n    Keith Keller				LET'S GO RANGERS!!!!!\n						LET'S GO QUAKERS!!!!!\n	kkeller@mail.sas.upenn.edu		IVY LEAGUE CHAMPS!!!!

Yes, but as has been mentioned many times before, the Islanders play at\nthe talent level of their opponent.  Since Hartford is pitiful, the\nIslanders played pitiful.  Since Pittsburgh is great, the Isles will most\nlikely play great.  This is most likely due to inexperience and very poor\nshooting.  To Greg: yes, I have noticed that the Islanders couldn't hit\nthe broad side of a barn with the puck if they were two feet in front of\nit.  Does anyone have shooting percentages?  I don't know if that would\nhelp, since they often miss the net completely, but it might shed some\nlight on the subject.\n\nAnd, my playoff pool is running!!!

I think this guy is going to be just a little bit disappointed.  Lemieux\ntwo, Tocchet, Mullen, Tippett, and Jagr.  I buzzed my friend because I forgot\nwho had scored Mullen's goal.  I said, "Who scored?  Lemieux two, Tocchet,\nTippett, Jagr."  The funny part was I said the "Jagr" part non-chalantly as\nhe was in the process of scoring while I was asking this question!!! :-)\n\nAll in all ABC's coverage wasn't bad.  On a scale of 1-10, I give it about\nan 8.  How were the games in the Chi/St. Louis/LA area???\n\n\nThat's stupid!!!  I'd complain to the television network!  If I were to even\nsee a Pirates game on instead of a Penguins game at this time of the year, I\nand many other Pittsburghers would surely raise hell!!!\n\n\nTexas is off to a good start, they may pull it out this year.  Whoops!  That\nbelongs in rec.sport.baseball!!!
^^\n      \n\n\nFunny you should mention it...this is exactly the case I was going to make.\n\n\nI will grant that a star like Mario will draw fans, even if the team sucks. \nBut this is short term only; I still do not think the attendance increase \nwill last, unless the team is a winning/competitive/improving/butt-kicking\none.  Pittsburgh was still getting better, so people continued to support\nthem.  If they suddenly dropped to, say, 50 points, you'd have knee surgery\nfor some of the people jumping off the bandwagon.  \n\n\nOk.  My numbers came from the NHL Guide and Record Book. \n\n\nYou can give the credit to Mario since he deserves it.  But my point is that\nit wasn't Mario himself, but it was the *expectation* of things to come (i.e.\na winning team) that he created by being the next great hockey superstar. And\nbefore anybody jumps in and says I'm nit-picking and mincing words, go back\nand read from where this thread started...\n\nIt might help to think about what would go through a fan's mind who suddenly\nfound an interest in Mario and the Pens.  Was it "gee, Mario Lemieux is\namazing, I'll go watch him play", or was it "gee, now we've got a *kick*\n*ass* guy on *our* side, I'll go watch him play".  I think it was the latter.\n\n\nI don't think this is accurate.  The *tickets* sell, but people don't go to\nthe games.  I think this thread has already been discussed...season ticket\nholders in LA don't always use their tickets.  So in effect, after the Kings\ninitial success following Gretzky's arrival (68 to 91 points, same source)\nand corresponding attendance jump, there has been an effective drop in\nattendance even though ticket sales may not have changed much.  \n\nWhether or not the Kings are a 'winner' is debatable.  I claim that since\nGretzky's arrival they have at the very least been competitive...I also claim\nthat McNall has made a stupid move in trying to reassemble the Oiler\ndynasty...but that's another story and included only because I don't like\nMcNall:-).  Anyway,  McNall did do some heavy marketing around Gretzky, and\nthat undoubtedly was also responsible for the attendance and merchandising\nsales, etc.  But as I said, when the Kings have been in there little\ntailspins over the past couple of years there have been empty seats at the\nForum even if the tickets were sold.\n\n\nFor the short term, IMO.  Although I think that it's inevitable that the team\nwill improve with a player such as Lemieux or Gretzky, simply because they\nmake people around them better.\n\n\nWell, at least we are in full agreement here!\n\n\nSo are you saying Roger has ever had a valid point? <couldn't resist...>\n\n\nYes, but they are doing no worse than last year.  I think the same type of\nreasoning I applied to a new Pittsburgh fan applies to all the extra people\nshowing up at Winnipeg games.  It's difficult to predict, but do you think\nthat if the Jets miss the playoffs next season that in the year after they\nwill maintain their attendance levels?  I seriously doubt it, because in that\ncase the expectation of an improving team would be gone, with or without\nSelanne.
You might want to clarify the 11 game winning streak.  That Pens streak\nis a PLAYOFF streak (tied by the Chicago Blackhawks, who had won 11 in a row\nuntil they met the Pens in the finals last year)  The 18 game unbeaten, so far,\nis a regular season unbeaten streak.  But hey, don't take it personally.  I'm a\nFlyers fan and two in a row is a stretch.  But with a healthy Lindros, Recchi,\nBrind'amour and Tommy Soderstrom, they'll be there next year!\nBy the way, since the Flyers need defenseman, what kind of trade would\nanybody suggest from the existing Flyers roster since the scuttlebutt is that\n\nTerry Carkner won't be there next year and apart from him a piece of notebook\npaper would be better defense.

You know what Frank? It's not David Poile's fault that the Caps\nhave mired in mediocrity for so long. Blame it on the owner, Abe Polin!\nThis guy owns both the NBA's Bullets and the NHL's Capitals. How dumb\nand selfish could this guy be? He's unwilling to spend the bucks in \norder to get a big star to Landover...no wonder both teams STINK!\n\n	I've heard that the Capitals had a chance to get Detroit's\nSteve Yzerman last summer but they pulled out at the last minute. Why?\nBecause our good man, Abe, is afraid to spend the cash!\n\n	Nevertheless, I'm still faithful and hoping that one day\nthis devilish dictator will be replaced.

Let's fill in some winners here:
I disagree.  McNall has demonstrated with Gretzky that a star brings out the\ncrowds whether or not the team is expected to do well.  Very few fans real-\nistically expect the Kings to do well this year (although I do) and yet they\nstill go out to see Gretzky.  This is the marketing strategy - selling the\ngame by selling the stars - that is employed by Baseball and, notably, the\nNBA and this is the attitude that the new Bettman/McNall leadership is \nbringing to the league.  They have gone on record as stating that they are\ntrying to sell the game on its stars.  Timo Salami and Brett Hull are perfect \nexamples of players that real fans know aren't worth a damn and yet, being\nbenificiaries of marketing-oriented coaching strategies, have goal totals\nthat would indicate to the casual observer, the very fans the NHL wants to\nattract, that these players are indeed superstars.\n\n\n\nIt ain't nearly so simple as this.  The casual fan doesn't think about much \nat all.  Can you actually find an adult with a 3 digit IQ who believes that\nMcDonalds makes good hamburgers?\n \n\nYes but apparently the Rocket has not lived up to his marketing responsi-\nbilities has he?  He was hyped, initially, as a superstar, but outside of\none Grey Cup game he has done very little to maintain/enhance that assess-\nment of his talents.  Most Argo fans probably feel the team would be better\noff without him. \n\ncordially, as always,\n\nrm
on\n\nHow many players of international class an average NHL team has. 6-10?\nTop players just play more in smaller rinks. Is the quality of European hockey\nreally poor, then recent years only few north-american (usually good farm \nplayers) players have got place in Finnish league or Elitserien, while most \nhave been shipped back.
: >	I loved the ABC coverage. The production was excellent. The appearance\n: >was excellent. It had a sleek modern look. This was the first time I heard\n: >Thorne & Clement & I thought they were great. My only request is to leave\n: >Al Micheals out of this. He annoys me. \n:\n: I was skeptical before the game but was pleasantly surprised at the\n: coverage.  I was particularly impressed by the close range camera coverage\n: of work in the corners and behind the play without losing a beat getting\n: back to the puck.\n\n   Boy - everyone has been ripping on ESPN's hockey coverage (or is it just\nPittsburgher's who are thrilled with Lange & Steigy?)  For all of you\nwho are unaware -> ESPN bought the air time from ABC and did all the \nproduction, advertising sales, commentating, etc -> and even \nreaped any $ made...
With everyone bitching about the hockey coverage by ESPN its almost like the \nDetroit-Toronto game was not televised last nite.  I was just thankful to see\nhockey on a night that it wasn't supposed to be carried.  Thanks to ESPN, no\nmatter why they televised the game
As I recall, the Penguins and Devils tied for third place last year\nwith identical records, as well.  Poor Devils -- they always get screwed.\nYet, they should put a scare into Pittsburgh.  They always do!  Pens in 7.
I watched him over his entire career.  I have NEVER seen a player, and that\nincludes Russell Courtnall and Davie Keon, screw up as many breakaways as\nBob Gainey.  And I will never forget the time Denis Potvin caught Gainey\nwith his head down.  You have been sold a bill of goods on Bob Gainey.\n\nGainey was a plugger.  And when the press runs out of things to say about \nthe stars on dynasties they start to hype the pluggers.  Grant Fuhr, Essa\nTikkannen, Butch Goring, Bob Nystrom, Bob Gainey, Doug Jarvis, Derek\nSanderson, Wayne Cashman, Bob Baun, Bob Pulford, Ralph Backstrom, Henri\nRichard, Dick Duff...and so on...\n\ncordially, as always,\n\nrm
Actually, Messier was invited, but declined due to nagging injuries...\nKeenan and Messier have always gotten along...Keenan dumped Steve\nYzerman from the last Canada Cup team, even though Yzerman had\nendured the training camp, when Messier who had missed essentially the\nentire camp recovering from injuries became available at the\nlast moment.
Just a quick note about Manon's immediate future: Rumor has it(USA Today's spor\nts page) that she will be playing with Tampa Bay's affiliate in the ECHL(I Thin\nk. It's been a couple of days. :)) She will supposedly be competing for the num\nber 2 goaltender spot.  I think, after her performance, which was damn good for\n someone who hasn't played squat all year, that we'll be seeing a lot more of h\ner in Atlanta in the years to come.\n \n \nWard
I think that you are incorrect, Roger.  Patrick,\nSmythe and Adams all played or coached in the league before becoming\nfront office types.  Hence, they did help build the league, although\nthey were not great players themselves.  \n\n	I agree that a name is a name is a name, and if some people\nhave trouble with names that are not easily processed by the fans,\nthen changing them to names that are more easily processed seems like\na reasonable idea.  If we can get people in the (arena) door by being\nuncomplicated, then let's do so.  Once we have them, they will realize\nwhat a great game hockey is, and we can then teach them something\nabotu the history of the game.  \n \n\n	No, I would not want to see a Ballard division.  But to say\nthat these owners are assholes, hence all NHL management people are\nassholes would be fallacious.  Conn Smythe, for example, was a classy\nindividual (from what I have heard). \n\n	Also, isn't the point of "professional" hockey to make money\nfor all those involved, which would include the players.  What I think\nyou might be saying is that the players have not made as much money as\nshould have been their due, and it is the players that are what make\nthe game great not the people who put them on the ice, so naming\ndivision after management people rather than players is adding insult\n(in the form of lesser recognition) to injury (less money than was\ndeserved).
Xenophobic trash deleted.\n\n\nIf you're going to go to those extremes, I guess you'd better start \npacking.  Because unless you're a Native North American, this isn't\nyour continent either.
Rex Wang (wangr@vccsouth22.its.rpi.edu) spews forth stupidly:\n\nPLEASE PLEASE PLEASE tell me that you don't actually ATTEND Rensselaer, and\nthat you just work for ITS. Or that this was tounge-in-cheek.\n\nDoes this mean that I should be cutting off my alumni contributions, or \nincreasing them?
Does anybody know the details of the Shriners All-Star game that featured the\nbest seniors in college hockey in a game in Orono, Maine?  If you do, please\nreply.
You know what my answer will be: Hrivnak! The choice is obvious.
Well, I have compiled some statistics on the entries of my pool.  There\nare unofficially 52 entrants.  Here are the stats on what teams were\npicked to win it all:\n\nPittsburgh:	34 (1 sweep, 14 in 5, 15 in 6, 4 in 7)\nBoston:		6  (1 in 5, 5 in 6)\nDetroit:	4  (3 in 6, 1 in 7)\nMontreal:	2  (1 in 5, 1 in 7)\nToronto:	2  (1 in 6, 1 in 7)\n   (no, this wasn't Roger)\nCalgary:	1  (in 6)\nQuebec:		1  (in 6)\nVancouver:	1  (in 7)\nWashington:	1  (in 6)\n\nWhy the hell hasn't anybody picked Chicago???  NOBODY!  Quebec got a pick,\nDetroit got 4, but absolutely no Chicago!  How odd.\n\nHere are the "losers":\n\nDetroit:	20\nChicago:	16	(so there they are!)\nPittsburgh:	6\nVancouver:	4\nBoston:		2\nCalgary:	2\nLos Angeles:	1	what?!?\nToronto:	1\n\nLOS ANGELES???????  Are you out of your mind?!?!?  Good luck to you,\nyou'll need it!\n\nSo Pittsburgh is the consensus winner of the Stanley Cup.  They'll\nstatistically beat Detroit in 6 games.  HAHA  that's happening!  NOT!  As\nI said, every one of my picks will come true, and I picked Chicago to lose\nto Pittsburgh in the finals, so tough luck to all you who picket Detroit.  \nWell, tough luck to all of ya!

Sorry to disappoint you but the Red Wings earned the victory...easily.\n\nI watched most of the game on ESPN (as soon as I realized that they\nwere televising the game which was at the beginning of the second).\nThe Maple Leafs were flat.  Very flat.  Meanwhile, the Red Wings were\nskating very freely and dictating the pace of the game.  I didn't\ndetect any bad penalty calls (Van Hellemond did his usual good job).\nToronto looked like how I expected them to for their first playoff\ngame in a few years -- nervous.\n\nFor the Leafs sake, I hope they can rid themselves of the butterflies\nfor game 2.  If game 1 is indicative of the series, it's gonna go\nquick.

What is the policy regarding players and the minor league playoffs versus WC?\nI know that the Rangers are holding back Kovalev, Zubov, and Andersson for\nBinghamton, but I also know that the Whalers wanted Michael Nylander to play\nfor Springfield, while Nylander wanted to play for Sweden. The Whalers allowed\nthe NHL to decide, and the NHL chose the WCs. How does this differ from the\nRangers and Oilers? Did the Whalers have to go through the league, or could\nthey have forced Nylander to play in Springfield?
The Pens are now being broadcast on 102.5 WDVE.
To those who are wondering what is happening in Minnesota:\n\n  From what I have seen in the local news (TV and newspaper), various people \nin the area are trying to get a new hockey team.  A columnist for the St. \nPaul "Pioneer Press" wrote an article giving the "inside scoop" on the \nissue.  There are three local sites competing for a team and three possible \ncandiates to move to the Twin Cities.  First the sites: Target Center, Civic \nCenter (St. Paul), and yes, even the Met Center.  The columnist was pretty \nconfident that Minnesota will get a team, and that the Target Center will \nultimately win out.  He argued, however, that the competition from the other \ntwo sites will delay the process considerably.  Without the \ninter-site competition, the columnist (sorry, I can't remember his name) \nbelieves that Minnesota would have a team by the 1994-95 season.  Also, \nbecause of the situation with the Timberwolves, things will be delayed \nuntil (unless) the city of Minneapolis takes over the Target Center.  \nHowever, they are unlikely to do so until the Met Center is destroyed, \nbecause the city will lose money if there is competition from the Met for \nconventions and short-term events (even with hockey at Target).  To add to \nthis mess, a STUDY (6 to 12 months) is going to be conducted on the future \nviability of the Met Center, which obviously delays the process even \nfurther.  I hope that the study is cancelled, which will have the effect of \nknocking the Met Center out of the running and perhaps encouraging \nMinneapolis to take over the Target Center sooner. The city would be\nbe even more encourged if the wrecking ball is taken to the Met, \nwhich may happen.\n	Regarding possible candidates, the three teams are \nHartford, Tampa Bay, and New Jersey.  I would prefer the Devils (Minnesota "\nIce Demons?") although the Lightning may have potential.  Although it hasn't \nbeen announced yet, it looks like 6 neutral site games will be played at the \nTarget Center next year.  Apparently the Devils are interested in playing in \nas many of those six games as possible, and I wouldn't be surprised to see \nHartford and Tampa show up there either.	So, Minnesota may end up \ngetting another team, but it may take a few years.\n\n	\n	Go Sabres!
But I gotta tell ya,\n\nIf the Hawks can't beat the Blues in a game that\nIS significant I can't wait to see how the Blues\nmight do against Toronto ;)\n\nBTW, if you think that the Hawks deserved to win that game\nI think you were not watching the same one everyone else\nwas.\n\nROAR'IN LEAF FAN
I just overheard that San Jose Coach George Kingston was officially\nterminated today...  Maybe good news, maybe bad.  I kinda liked him, but he\nseemed to lack a certain fire.
This is a general question for US readers:\n\nHow extensive is the playoff coverage down there?  In Canada, it is almost\nimpossible not to watch a series on TV (ie the only two series I have not had\nan opportunity to watch this year are Wash-NYI and Chi-Stl, the latter because\nI'm in the wrong time zone!).  We (in Canada) are basically swamped with \ncoverage, and I wonder how many series/games are televised nationally or even\nlocally in the US and how much precedence they take over, say, local news if\nthe games go into double-OT.\n\nEmail me so as not to waste bandwidth, please.  My news feed is kind of slow\nanyways.
I think Murray has done a great job.  He's picked up Ciccarelli,\nSheppard, Ysebaert, Howe, Coffey, and Riendeau (plus some depth players) \nwithout giving up anything the Wings needed or any of his top prospects.\nAll of this in three years.  Has anyone done better?\n\nThe year before he took over, the Wings didn't even make the playoffs.\nThere was about a year and a half during Demers' stint that the Wings\ndid OK, but that was due to Demers' motavational skills and clutch\nand grab style.  They didn't have much talent.\n\nGerald, Murray wasn't responsible for Primeau (although I'm not\nready to admit that's a horrible pick).  They hired him after the\ndraft (which has never made sense to me).  His first pick was\nLapointe.\n\nRon
Well, I could become a fan ... (-;\n\nSeriously, this news coming since Thursday has effectively robbed the\nIslanders and the Devils of any airtime on sports talk shows almost\neverywhere that I've sampled ... in fact, the playoffs almost don't\nexist now. )-; Ranger fans calling in to WFAN or to New York One's\nmidnight sports talk were in a mix of fury over this season and near-\norgasm over Keenan's hiring.  (Summarizing: Keenan is a winner and\nwill give the Broadway Bums 'da business' in pursuing the next Cup\nchase ...)\n\n\nThis will be an interesting combination to watch ... Keenan has been\npaid enough money to put up and shut up and just be a coach, but his\nadvice on any player moves will be listened to closely.  A lot of big\nplayer moves will happen --- remember that Keenan got rid of Denis\nSavard.  The country club days are over ...\n\n\nIf Paramount had given Smith an earlier sign of support and offered\nKeenan the big money to put-up-and-shut-up back in January, the\nRangers might not be heading for golf now ...\n\n\n\nOne of Keenan's first statements was a reaffirmation that Mark Messier\nwill be the team's captain.\n\n\nBy then, Smith might have some bargains on Keenan's advice ... like\nmaybe unloading Phil Bourque for Tie Domi ...

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n    Don't be so sure, the Blues played the Hawks pretty well this season,\nand won twice at the Stadium. The Blues will give the Hawks a hard time.\nThis series is one of the best first round matchups, could go either way.\nThe Hawks will probably prevail in seven games.

You think that's bad?  I'm in Bowling Green, OH, and we get ABC from\nToledo.  Well, the cable co. decided to totally pre-empt the game (no tape\ndelay, no nothing) for a stupid telethon!  Hockey is very big around here,\ntoo.  I had to listen to "my" Penguins win on my car radio out in the\nparking lot.  I can just be thankful for a strong radio because being 230\nmiles from Pittsburgh, the reception usually isn't good at all.  I can't\nbelieve I picked it up during the middle of the day.
#21	PETER AHOLA		Season: 2nd\nAcquired:	'92-93, trade with Pittsburgh for future considerations\nGrade:		I (B)\n\nIt is way too early to tell about Ahola, who was acquired probably because the\nPenguins figured that they would lose him in the expansion draft.  Ahola had\nonly played 50 games this season (I think it's actually less; the San Jose\nMercury News may be in err here), 20 of them with the Sharks.  In the games he\nhas played, he appeared quite solid defensively, although he hasn't been\nspectacular, and his offense isn't anything to write home about (8 points);\nit's even possible that the trade may be for future considerations which turn\nout to be ... Peter Ahola.\n\n#24	DOUG WILSON		Season: 16th\nAcquired:	'91-92, trade with Chicago for RW Kerry Toporowski and\n		2nd round pick in '92 entry draft\nGrade:		I (B)\n\nI have often been accused of overly down on Wilson; I may have had too high\nexpectations for him, but his legs, knees, et al., are giving out.\nNevertheless, when he was playing, he exhibited a strong shooting and\nplaymaking abilities, even if he has lost a step on defense, which,\nunfortunately, he demonstrated this year as well, as at times he was slow to\ncatch the opponent forwards, and his offensive output was only good enough for\n2nd place on the team (20 points in 42 games).  But next year, which may be\nWilson's last, if he can stay healthy, he can still be a contributor.\n\n#29	DEAN KOLSTAD		Season:	2nd\nAcquired:	'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft\nGrade:		I (C-/D+)\n\nIt's probably somewhat unfair for me to judge Kolstad on just a handful of\ngames (forgetting exact number, but no more than 15), but at age 25 he's\nquickly running out of time if he wants to make it to the NHL.  In those games,\nhe did not impress anyone; after generating 7 shots in the first period of\nthe first game he played, he scored just 2 points in his tenure up here with\nthe Sharks, and was even less impressive defensively, as he appeared awkward\nwith his movement and was prone to giveaways.  He needs to make a leap in\nhis level of performance to have any chance of making the team.\n\n#38	PAT MACLEOD		Season: 2nd\nAcquired:	'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft\nGrade:		I (?)\n\nMacLeod was on the roster a lot longer than Kolstad, but it appears to my\nmemory that he played less than Kolstad, because the Sharks were reluctant to\nuse him, but were even more reluctant to send him to the minors, figuring that\nhe wouldn't clear waivers; in fact, he has played the past 4-5 weeks with\nKansas City, but is still technically there on a rehabilitation assignment,\na "rehab assignment" that will include him playing in the Turner Cup playoffs.\nSince he has played so little, I can't even give a tentative grade on him, but\nhe demonstrated last year excellent offensive skills but terrible defensive\nskills.\n\n#41	TOM PEDERSON		Season: 1st\nAcquired:	'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft\nGrade:		I (B+)\n\nCalled up in the middle of the season when the defensive corps was decimated\nby injuries, Pederson impressed many Sharks fan here on net, including yours\ntruly.  He demonstrated very good offensive skills, scoring 20 points in\n43 games.  However, his size (5' 9", 165 lbs.) is of concern, and soon after\nhe began to shine offensive did teams begin to push him around physically,\non both sides of the ice, although he had appeared fearless in his approach.\nBut to be successful, he probably needs to bulk up to have a fighting chance\non surviving against some of the bigger players in the league.\n\n#45	CLAUDIO SCREMIN		Season: 1st\nAcquired:	'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft\nGrade:		I (D+/D)\n\nHe played all of ~5 games in the league this year, but was thoroughly\numimpressive, just as he was at the end of last season; again, it may be a\nsmall sample, but just as in the case of Kolstad, Scremin, at age 25, is\nquickly running out of time.  He was not a contributor on either offense or\ndefense in the games he played with the Sharks.  The only notable thing that\nwill go down in Scremin's entry of league stats is probably the fact that he\nwas once traded for now Capitals goaltender Don Beaupre.
Heard last night that Paul Kuryia will be playing for the Canadian World\nHockey team this year.  He was on a local radio station when a friend of\nthe familty called to congratulate him on the invitation.  Meekly Paul told\nthe host that he didn't think they wanted it out yet.  This morning I heard\nthat he is destined to play on a line with Lindros and Recci{unsure of this\none}.  If he plays well in this arena, he could go #1 or 2 in the draft.
I was wondering if any Star Trek TNG fans in this newsgroup knew of a\npossible relationship between the Bruins' players Douris & Moog and the\nKlingon names Duras and Worf (Son of Moog). I suppose it's a coincidence.\n\nJust curious,
: FINLAND:  \n: \n: D-Jyrki Lumme.......20\n: D-Teppo Numminen....20\n: D-Peter Ahola.......13\n: \nWell well, they don't like our defenders (mainly Lumme and Numminen)...\n\n: C-Jari Kurri........25\n: C-Christian Ruuttu..16\n: \nNow, do YOU think that Ruuttu is only worth 16 ? I think it might be 20.\n\n: R-Teemu Selanne.....27\n: \nCompared to Kurri, Selanne's points are too high, lets make it 25 or 26.\n\n\n: well in the Canada Cup and World Championships largely due to the efforts of\n: Markus Ketterer (the goalie), 3-4 or the players listed above and luck. There's\n: presumably a lot of decent players in Finland that wouldn't be superstars at\n: the highest level but still valuable role players, however. My guess would be\n: that the Finnish Canada Cup team would be a .500 team in the NHL.\n\nWow, now, it looks like you don't like our players? What about guys like:\nNieminen, Jutila, Riihijarvi, Varvio, Laukkanen, Makela, Keskinen and (even\nif he is aging) Ruotsalainen? The main difference between finnish and North-\nAmerican players is, that our players tend to be better in the larger rink.\nThe Canadian defenders are usually slower that defenders in Europe. \nAnd I think that there was more in our success than Ketterer and luck (though\nthey helped). I think that the main reason was, that the team worked well\ntogether.
How exactly would Ferreira accomplished this?  The three-headed GM-ship has\ntaken a lot of heat, but nobody's explained how things would have been any\ndifferent had Ferreira still been there.  Would Ferreira have made more\ntrades?  Who would have he had traded?  Would he have made fewer trades?\nWho should not have been traded?
[stuff deleted]\n\nOk, here's the solution to your problem.  Move to Canada.  Yesterday I was able\nto watch FOUR games...the NJ-PITT at 1:00 on ABC, LA-CAL at 3:00 (CBC), \nBUFF-BOS at 7:00 (TSN and FOX), and MON-QUE at 7:30 (CBC).  I think that if\neach series goes its max I could be watching hockey playoffs for 40-some odd\nconsecutive nights (I haven't counted so that's a pure guess).\n\nI have two tv's in my house, and I set them up side-by-side to watch MON-QUE\nand keep an eye on BOS-BUFF at the same time.  I did the same for the two\nafternoon games.\n\nBtw, those ABC commentaters were great!  I was quite impressed; they seemed\nto know that their audience wasn't likely to be well-schooled in hockey lore\nand they did an excellent job.  They were quite impartial also, IMO.
Depends on what you mean by classy. From what I've heard about\nhim, he was about as classy as Harold Ballard.  Only difference was\nthat back then almost all the owners were like that, so he seemed okay\nby comparison.  Read the book "Net Worth" for one view of what Smythe\n(and Norris and Adams and Campbell) were like. \n\n\n\n     Even more specifically, I think what Roger was saying (and I said\nit previously too) is that these are NOT the people who made the\nleague great, so why should divisions, conferences etc. be named after\nthem instead of Morenz, Vezina, Howe, Orr etc., the people who DID\nmake it great.  Instead, the NHL has chosen to immortalize the men who\ngot rich off of the men who made the game great.

Does anyone recieve annoying email from Roger Maynard whenever they post an\narticle telling them to leave him alon and stop posting to the group??\nThese emails are filled with insults- more than are usual in Roger's posts\nand have little if any hockey info.\nI have recieved two in the last 2 days.\nI am just wondering if I am special or Roger trys to bully everyone who\ndisagrees with him.\n\nGregmeister\n\nObligatory hockey comment:
little.\n\nI know what you mean!  I glow everytime Ronnie's out on the ice.\nIn fact, one of the neatest things about seeing the Pens in person\nis that I can key in on him instead of watching what I'd probably\nbe seeing on tv.  He does so many subtle things behind the play.\n\nHe said in an interview recently that when he was a kid his dad\nstressed the importance of playing two-way hockey; that you have to\nlearn how to play defense as well as offense and he obviously took\nthat advice to heart.  He was a breath of fresh air when he arrived\nin Pittsburgh to the team whose forwards, for the most part, couldn't\nand wouldn't play a lick of defense.\n\nIt's really difficult to assess what the key trades were that brought\nall of this success to the Pens.  You mention Rick Tocchet and he has\ncertainly helped, and even ol' Kjell has been steady.  But looking at\nthis team you could almost take any one of them out of the line-up\npermanently and replace them with an extremely mediocre player and it\nwouldn't matter.\n\nIf I had to pick the top three acquisitions in recent years they would\nbe 1) Tom Barrasso; 2) Ron Francis; 3) Larry Murphy.  (I'd love to put\nFrancis first but I do think the only thing that could really damage\nthe Pens right now would be to lose Barrasso.)
About 25 is correct for Numminen and Lumme.\n\n\n\nNo, Kurri's points are too low. 27 for Kurri and 28 for Sel{nne.\n\n\n\n\nThat's true. Game is so different here in Europe compared to NHL. North-ame-\nricans are better in small rinks and europeans in large rinks. An average\neuropean player from Sweden, Finland, Russian or Tsech/Slovakia is a better \nskater and  puckhandler than his NHL colleague. Especially defenders in NHL\nare mainly slow and clumsy. Sel{nne has also said that in the Finnish Sm-league\ngame is more based on skill than in NHL. In Finland he couldn't get so many \nbreakaways because defenders here are an average much better skaters than in\nNHL. Also Alpo Suhonen said that in NHL Sel{nne's speed accentuates because\nof clumsy defensemen.\n\nI have to admit that the best players come from Canada, but those regulars\naren't as skilful as regulars in the best european leagues. Also top europeans\nare in the same level as the best north-americans.(except Lemieux is in the\nclass of his own).

So what's the deal with Bill Wirtz? Apparently, the Blackhawks - St.\nLouis game was a standing room only sell out as usual, but the Hawks\nreported the attendace as 16,199. Gee, I wonder if Wirtz is planning to\nuse this as justification for continuing to keep home games off of TV?\nWhat a schmuck.\n\nIn other TV news, the Penguins announced yesterday that they will have 3\nfewer broadcast TV games, and will have 22(!) games on some sort of\nsubscription / pay-per-view system. Yuck.
Smythe Division\n---------------\n\nVancouver vs. Winnipeg - Jets in 7\nThe Jets have played the Canucks tough the last three games.  Everyone is\nhealthy for the Jets.  I'm biased.  :)\n\nCalgary vs. Los Angeles - Flames in 6\nFrom what I have seen, the Kings have looked flat lately.  I just can't see\nthem getting by the Flames.\n\nFinal- Jets in 6.\nThe Jets haven't lost to the Flames in '93.  They will, but it will be a\nclose series that will come down to how well Roberts has recovered.  I\ndon't think he'll be 100%, and while it will help, it won't be enough.\n\nNorris Division\n---------------\n\nChicago vs. St. Louis/Minnesota\nChicago in 6 against the Blues, 7 against the Stars.  \n\nDetroit vs. Toronto - Wings in 6.\nThe Wings should be able to shutdown Gilmour and Andreychuk.  Chelvadae is\nmore experienced than Potvin.\n\nFinal - Hawks in 7.  Brutal series.  Probert and Chelios will go at it.\nBelfour is better than Chelvadae, IMHO.\n\nConference Final - Hawks in 6.  It hurts, but the Hawks are more experienced,\nand that will carry them through to the final.\n\nPrince of Wales Conference\n--------------------------\n\nAdams Division\n--------------\n\nBoston vs. Buffalo - Bruins in 6.\nB's can check, Juneau is darn good, and Neely.  The Sabres rely too much\non Lafontaine and Mogilny.\n\nQuebec vs. Montreal - Montreal in 7.\nClassic battle, the inexperience will hurt the Nords, this year.\n\nFinal - Bruins in 5.  Habs will be hurting from their series with the Nords,\nand Boston has been able to control the scorers on the Habs.\n\nPatrick Division\n----------------\n\nPittsburgh vs Islanders/Devils - Pens in 5.\nOne word.  Mario.\n\nWashington vs. Devils/Islanders - Caps in 6 / Devils in 7.\nI think the Caps can beat the Isles, but not the Devils.  Tabaracci has been\nstrong in goal, and if he plays like last year, he could carry the team.\nIt doesn't matter, though.\n\nFinal - Pens in 5.  Two more words.  Stevens.  Jagr.\n\nCup Final - Pens in 6.  Three last words.  Tocchet.  Murphy.  Barrasso.\n\nThe only thing I don't like about this is that the Pens woofers are going to\nbe out in full force again.  (I don't mean the regular Penguin fans...it's\njust like the bunch around here that if these predictions are true will post\nlike nuts while the Jets are winning, but we won't hear from again when they\nlose.)\n\n(Oh yeah...next year's Cup prediction...Jets in 7 over the Nords.)
Actually Steve, I think he was refering to the Leafs, and when they can\nbe expected to hit the greens...
Maybe in the 60's, but not now.  Steel is a dead industry in Pgh. \n\nNo, a giveaway night in the 90's for Pgh would be "Baboon Liver Night"\nsponored by The Pittsburgh Zoo...
Not in Indiana:  they showed a tape-delay of Chicago v Boston, because\nWGN had the rainout of the cubs.  So WGN showed reruns of Hitchcock.\nNo hockey (at least in this part of the state).\n\nGo Aeros!
Wow.  So that's probably the reason why current assistant coach Drew Ramenda\nhinted that he won't be back.  Thanks for the news, Mikko; can you (or any\nof our Finnish netters) comment on Tichonov?
Markus had a good season in MoDo in the Swedish elite league, scoring\n 22 goals, 17 assists, 39 points and 67 PIM in 39 games.\n\n As Daryl points out, Markus won't be joining the Pens for this year's\n playoffs, since the World Championships starts April 18th.\n\n But there is a good chance that Markus will join the Pens before next\n season. MoDo, though, naturally wants to keep their superstars Forsberg\n and Naslund, so the latest news on this is that MoDo is looking for\n personal sponsors for Forsberg and Naslund in order to match the kind\n of money they would receive in NHL.\n\n\n Actually, Swedish coach Curt Lundmark is thinking about leaving two\n spots open for additions from eliminated NHLers. It is Mats Sundin and\n Calle Johansson that Curt hopes can join the team, although in a late\n stage of the tournament. Technically, I seem to recall that you can leave\n spots open until 24 hrs before the WC final.\n\n Staffan
1992-93 Los Angeles Kings notes.\n--------------------------------\nPlayoffs:\n---------\n*Stauber disturbed by third-man theme\nby Rick Sadowski, Daily News\n\nBarry Melrose's decision to stick Robb Stauber in the stands rather than in the\ncrease or even on the bench for the Stanley Cup playoffs does not sit well with\nthe rookie goaltender.\n\n"I want to be a part of the team at the most crucial time of the year, the most\nfun time of the year, and I'm not,"  Stauber said with some emotion Monday.  "I\nthink I have worked hard enough for that."\n\nStauber said he accepts Melrose's choice of Kelly Hrudey as the teams top goalie\nin their playoff series with the Calgary Flames. Hrudey made 21 saves in Sundays\n6-3 opening victory.\n\nBut Stauber clearly is upset with his sudden status as the No. 3 man behind Rick\nKnickle.  Stauber had a 4-1-2 record and 2.98 goals-against average down the\nstretch in the regular season and nearly wrestled the No. 1 job from Hrudey.\n\nKnickle?  He won 2 of 3 decisions but had a bloated 5.26 average, twice was \nyanked from games (once for stomach cramps) and hasn't played since March 29.\n\nYet, when the series resumes Wednesday, Knickle will serve as Hrudey's backup\nagain and Stauber will have to satisfy his playoff hunger by munching on Olympic\nSaddledome popcorn.\n\n"If I'm supposedly close to being the starter or could have been the starter...I\ndropped too. 3.  What happened to No. 2?"  Stauber wondered.  "Not that I'd be\nhappy with No. 2, but I feel I should at least be a part of this team in the\nplayoffs."\n\nPerhaps Stauber eventually will get his chance, but Melrose apparently is not\nconvinced the 25-year old is capable of handling playoff pressure.\n\nWhile insisting he is the Kings' "goalie of the future," Melrose said Stauber\nflubbed all four of the big games he was asked to win this season.  They were,\naccording to Melrose: a 7-2 loss to San Jose on Dec. 26; An 8-3 loss to the New\nYork Rangers on Jan. 23; a 6-6 tie with Detroit on Feb. 11; an 8-6 loss to \nVancouver on Thursday.\n\n"Four times this season Robb could have emerged as the elite goalie, he could\nhave taken it away from Kelly Hrudey, and he didn't do it," Melrose said.  "An\nelite goaltender has to carry the ball when you give it to him.  The mark of a\ngreat goalie is that he isn't satisfied to be a backup."\n\n"I'm not blaming Robb for the losses, but if you're going to be No. 1, you've\ngot to be able to walk your talk.  You've got to be able to play when everything\nis on the line.  Robb Stauber has a great deal of ability, but maybe I expect\nmore from him than he does."\n\nOuch.  That remark stung Stauber.  He began the season 9-0-1, struggled when the\nteam hit a mid-season slump, didn't play for a month after Knickle was signed\noff the San Diego Gulls roster, then came on at the end.\n\n"I expect more from myself than anybody, including Barry Melrose," said Stauber,\na three-year star at the University of Minnesota who left school in 1989, only \nto have his development hampered by a string of serious injuries.\n\n"What I've been through the last four years - two knee operations, a herniated\ndisk in my back, shoulder surgery - what more can I go through?  I obviously do\nexpect a lot from myself, otherwise I wouldn't be here."\n\n"Anybody who would disagree with that doesn't know me.  I'm not saying Barry \ndoesn't know me, but don't say I've been without expectations.  If anything, I'm\na perfectionist."\n\nStauber acknowledged he played poorly in the four games Melrose mentioned. "But \neven though I didn't play well, I get knocked down from maybe on to three? It's \na bit of a jump," he said.  "You're almost No. 1, or if you play a good game \nyou're No. 1 and if you don't you're No. 3?  Why does Jack Nicklaus shoot a 67 \nand then a 75?  Can you explain that?  That's what barry wanted me to explain \nto him, why I didn't come through when he counted on me.  I don't know. What I \ndo know is, it's a sport.  I'll be there."\n\nMelrose's "goalie of the future" statement doesn't mean much to Stauber. "Before\nyou know it, I'll be 30 and there will be no future," he said.\n\n------\n\n*Game 1 of the Kings @ Flames playoff series drew a 4.2 Nielsen rating on ABC \nChannel 7 here in LA.

Well, if things were different and I had my way, the headline would be: "NHL,\nEuropean Division regular season game: Stockholm Storm vs. Helsinki Tornado\n4-3..." Two games against every North American-based team (46 in all), and this\nmight have been the ninth and final regular season encounter between Helsinki\nand Stockholm.

ESPN/ABC will not be able to\nuse its new favorite toy,the ice-level shot, in Pittsburgh where too many\nseats would have to removed to employ it...\n\n\nIn case of a blowout in progress in Pittsburgh,ABC will switch to Chicago\ngame but will come back to the Pittsburgh game for updates or if the game\ngets closer(Ha!)..\n\nABC expects huge ratings(by hockey standards) since all 3 Top US TV-markets\nare involved - NY metro area(NY Islanders/NJ Devils),Chicago(BlackHawks),\nand LA(Kings).\n\nStay tuned,\n\nThanks Mike,
You know... after I finished laughing I thought:  This would be a great\nfinal.  Two Canadian teams with lots of tradition and all that Don Cherry\nnonsense behind them and a nail-biter finish.\n\nOf course, I would prefer a Vancouver--Montreal final with Vancouver\nscoring the final goal....\n\nPity neither will happen.

Anyone who really believes that the Caps can beat\nthe Pens are kidding themselves.  The Pens may not loose\none game in the playoffs.
I can only comment on the Kings, but the most obvious candidate for pleasant\nsurprise is Alex Zhitnik. He came highly touted as a defensive defenseman, but\nhe's clearly much more than that. Great skater and hard shot (though wish he\nwere more accurate). In fact, he pretty much allowed the Kings to trade away\nthat huge defensive liability Paul Coffey. Kelly Hrudey is only the biggest\ndisappointment if you thought he was any good to begin with. But, at best, he's\nonly a mediocre goaltender. A better choice would be Tomas Sandstrom, though\nnot through any fault of his own, but because some thugs in Toronto decided \nto threaten his career in order to avoid conceding a goal. Other than that, the\naward goes to Robert Lang, an uninspiring Czech. Robitaille could easily be\nMVP, but I'd prefer to give it to Rob Blake who is quietly becoming one of the\nleague's premier defensemen, and if the Kings manage to hold onto him and the \nrest of our young defense, it could one day mean that we'll let in fewer\ngoals than Hartford. Honorable mentions to Majestic Marty and Warren Rychel.\nJon
It was great to hear that UMass is bringing back hockey!  It reminded me that a\ncouple of years ago there was talk that both Bimidgi (sp?) and Mankato State\ntrying to upgrade their programs to Div. 1 status.  I also seem to remember\nthat they had some trouble with new NCAA rule about just who was allowed to\ncompete at the Div. 1 level.  Was that ever resolved?  Also, I was just\nwondering if there is ANY college hockey east of Colorado (Alaska excepted).\nWith the new popularity of hockey on the west coast, I would expect there to\nbe some interest building at the collegiate levels too. Anyone heard anything?\n                      James Old, e-mail JOLD@vma.cc.nd.edu

Detroit is a very disciplined team.  There's a lot of Europeans\nin Detroit which would make the game fast, so Toronto would have\nto slow the game down, which means drawing penalties, as a last\nresort anyway.  Toronto will be a good team as soon as they get\nmore good players.  Toronto is just an average team, Detroit isn't\nBallard screwed Toronto when he was owner.  Everyone knows that.\nand it's going to take time for Toronto to become a real force.\nI expect Gilmour to be burnt out next year.  He can't pull the\nwhole team forever.
Dale Hawerchuk and Troy Murray were both captains of the Jets\nwhen they were traded.  (Murray this year in mid-season, Hawerchuk\na few years ago in the off-season.)
You know, you're absolutely right.  I think we should round up all those\nplayers of European descent and ship 'em back to where they came from.  Let's\nsee, with whom should we start?  I dunno, Lemieux?  Hmmm...sounds like he\nhas *French* blood in him!!!  Hey!  France is part of Europe!  Send that\nEuro-blooded boy back!!!\n\nSheesh.\n\n\nI don't think it would be hard to find some Native Americans (or Native\nCanadians, for that matter) who would dispute your claim to this great \ncontinent of *ours.*  Ya see, if you believe the anthropologists, we're *all*\nimmigrants of some sort.  If you really don't think that Mogilny, Bure,\nSelanne, et al have improved the NHL, then I'm not sure you understand the\ngame.
Lloyd Pettit.\n\n\nYes, it is true that he refused to buy a franchise from the NHL for $50M; but\nat the time the reason was that the established market for teams was much \nless than that. He felt that no one would pay $50M for an expansion team, and\nthat he would simply wait to buy an existing franchise for less than that. But\nthe market fooled him, and 5 teams have been created for $50M apiece in the\nlast three years, and even the existing teams can't be moved for less than \n$50M and I doubt that he could get one for that little.\n\nPettit gambled and lost. Now he'll have to pay more.

Tom Barrasso wore a great mask, one time, last season.  He unveiled it\nat a game in Boston.  \n\nIt was all black, with Pgh city scenes on it.  The "Golden Triangle"\n(Pgh's downtown area where the 3 rivers meet) graced the top, along\nwith a steel mill on one side and the Civic Arena (I think) on the \nother.   On the back of the helmet was the old Pens' logo (the really\nfat little penguin with the blue scarf) the current (at the time) Pens\nlogo, and a space for the "new" (now current) logo.\n\nTommy had designed the mask, and his mother (an artist) painted it\nfor him.  \n\nBut while wearing the mask, the Pens got thumped by the Bruins.  The\nvery next game, Tommy was back to the old paint job.  A great mask\ndone in by a goalie's superstition.
I *loved* Dan Kelly!  He was on USA when I first got hooked on Hockey back\nin 1980 or so.  No, he wasn't always spot on top of the play, and he\nwasn't overly cute, but those pipes!  That lusty, barrel chested, voice!\nNo pipsqueak was he (unlike some fellas we know!)\n\nI rode into hockey mania on the coattails of Gretzky and the Boys on the\nBus.  My first Finals saw the Islanders sweep them.  But I'll never\nforget the night, a year later, when the Oilers closed it out at home in\nthe pandemonium, the smoke from a million sparklers, the long empty-net\ngoal near the end, and Dan Kelly letting the crowd's reaction tell the\nstory for a few long seconds, then that voice barking through the din\n"Dave Lumley ... sews it up for Edmonton!"  It sounds stupid, but that\nearly (for me) hockey memory will always bring a thrill.  Since then\nI've grown a lot more jaded about the game, but I was really saddened\nby Dan Kelly's passing.  He was one of the good guys.
Wales Conference, Adams Division, Semifinal\n\nI'm hoping for a Fuhr miracle, but I agree that Boston will likely win the\nseries.  Goaltending is about equal, top offensive players are about equal\n(Mogilny-LaFontaine vs. Oates-Juneau), but Buffalo has no answer to Neely\n(not to imply that Neely is not a top offensive player btw, in fact he's one\nof my favourites even though he's a damn Bruin :) ).  And the rest of the\nmatchup wrt lineup favours Boston anyway.  But I think it will go six.\n\n\nAgreed here...but Montreal will be pushed to the limit.  Is it just me, or\ndoes everything Montreal does in the playoffs come down to Roy?  Go Habs!!\n\nFinal\n\nI can't predict a Montreal victory because I've been watching them play for\n6 weeks and IMO they severly need some tougher players, especially to play\nin the Garden.  Last time they beat the B's 5-2 but Boston had a clear\nterritorial advantage; the victory was Roy's.  At the same time, I can't\nbring myself to predict the possibility of a loss, so I'll just say I will\nnot be putting money on this series. :-)\n\n\n\nAgreed.  NY doesn't have the goaltending to stop the onslaught, independent\nof the trouble they have given Pittsburgh this year.  Pens in five, which is\ncredit to NY.\n\n\nAgreed here too, but I think it will go at least six.  Jersey has a decent\nteam, and Washington has done poorly against the division this year.\n\n\nI think they will use Tabaracci more after Beaupre gets shelled.  I don't\nthink it will go six either...*maybe* five.\n\n\nIf Pittsburgh plays Boston, IMO they win in likely five, possibly six.  They\nown the Bruins.  If they play Montreal, I think it will go to seven, and once\nagain I won't be putting money on the seventh game.  I say seven because the\nHabs have played Pittsburgh very tough this season.\n\n\n\nChicago will win, but I think in at least six.  Chicago is not that good,\nIMO.  And remember that they take ridiculous numbers of penalties.\n\n\nVery true.  The Leafs have much to be proud of, but they will soon find out\nwhy Montreal did so lousy in the playoffs.  Toronto might win two or three \nat MLG though.  Wings in six, maybe even seven.\n\n\nIt _will_ be a war...possibly the most intense playoff series of them all. \nAnd yes, I think Detroit will win.  Probert will have to come up big though.\n\n\n\nOur first disagreement.  Canucks are playing like shit.  They don't use their\nsize *at* *all*, which may explain why they get hammered 8-1 by a team\nchasing them (Calgary)....Winnipeg in six.\n\n\nThis is also tough for me to call, because I haven't seen the Smythe enough. \nI don't think Roberts will be well enough to figure in, Coffey is a\nnon-issue, who cares what Carson has done before, and *never* underestimate\nGretzky.  LA in six.\n\n\nIf it is these two, Calgary will not need six games.  But I think it will be\nLA-Winnipeg anyway, and LA in seven, because of home ice.\n\n\nWow, must've been tough to go against your team.  But let's see, I picked\nLA-Detroit.  Detroit will win, probably in six.\n\n\nIf Pittsburgh plays Detroit, it will go longer than five, and I wouldn't bet\nagainst the Wings.  They are very strong, IMO, and nobody knows *how* strong\nbecause they've been underachieving most of the year.  If forced to choose,\nthough, I'd have to take the Penguins.\n\nA side note.  Vlad, last week you said that Selanne was a better player than\nGilmour.  NO WAY.  He is a more talented pure goal scorer...but aside from\nthe age difference, there is no way I would take him over Gilmour on my team.\nI'm not asking for flames, either, btw....I've spent more than enough time\narguing on behalf of Selanne and I still say he's a great player.  But while\nhe and Gilmour are both dangerous offensively (give Teemu an edge),\nGilmour *does* *it* *all*.  I know a lot of Gilmour-bashing goes on, esp.\nfrom Flame fans.  But IMO you guys are letting your dislike of Gilmour cloud\nyour judgement when it comes to his skill.  He is easily one of the best\nall-round players in the NHL.
Actually this stuff from Mogilny doesn't surprise me all that much.  About 4\nor 5 weeks ago I read in the Toronto Sun a quote from Alex; it went something\nlike [sarcastically]:\n\n"Yep, Patty's the man.  He's responsible for the team's success...I'm a \nnobody around here."\n\nI was going to post it at the time...I must have forgot since nobody else \nwas talking about him being a problem.\n\n\nYep, I'd beat the shit out of him too.  LaFontaine really must be a team\nplayer...makes you wonder what the Islander management was thinking.\nMy question is what the hell is Muckler doing?  Whether he wishes to admit it\nor not, the team is his to coach, and if he can't do the job then maybe the\njob should be given to somebody who can.  \n\nGee, kinda like Alex's spot on the team, isn't it?
His designated point-getter remarks were not only meant for Lemieux,\nbut for Gretzky, Bure, etc. etc. .... and he made those particular\nremarks last December before Lemieux was diagnosed with Hodgkin's,\nand as the Leafs started their second half roll, and before\nGilmour's great season was being recognized by many people.
I would have chosen Alex Zhitnik for biggest suprise.  They\ndid expect that he would become a great defenseman, but I don't\nthink anyone knew that he was going to be this impressive in his \nrookie year.  His speed, skating ability, and puck control is\nexceptional -- he is the one to watch on the Kings.\n\n\nKris\nkris@fs2.assist.uci.edu\n\nGO KINGS!

All these people who send in their polls should take a closer look at\nNJD, they are a very deep team, with two very capable goalies, and\nexcellent forwards and defensemen.  Shooter in Richer, an all around do\nit all in Todd, chef Stasny-master of a thousand dishes, power play\ncaptain-Stevens.  Take a look at the numbers, or play with them and see\nfor yourselves.

Played in Scandinavium, Gothenburg, April 15 1993:\n ==================================================\n\n SWEDEN - FINLAND  6-6 (1-2,3-1,2-3)\n\n 1st: SWE 1-0 Peter Popovic      (Markus Naslund)                     6:10\n      FIN 1-1 Ville Siren        (Keijo Sailynoja)                    8:44 (pp)\n      FIN 1-2 Juha Riihijarvi    (Timo Saarikoski,Vesa Viitakoski)   13:12 (pp)\n 2nd: FIN 1-3 Jari Korpisalo     (Kari Harila,Rauli Raitanen)         6:48\n      SWE 2-3 Jan Larsson        (Mikael Renberg,Stefan Nilsson)      7:25\n      SWE 3-3 Hakan Ahlund       (Thomas Rundqvist)                   8:56\n      SWE 4-3 Roger Akerstrom    (Roger Hansson)                      9:13\n 3rd: SWE 5-3 Stefan Nilsson     (Patrik Juhlin,Charles Berglund)     2:20\n      FIN 5-4 Keijo Sailynoja                                         9:23\n      FIN 5-5 Keijo Sailynoja                                         9:44 (ps)\n      SWE 6-5 Mikael Renberg     (Hakan Ahlund,Thomas Rundqvist)     17:16\n      FIN 6-6 Jari Korpisalo                                         17:44\n\n             Shots on goal:      Penalties:     Attendance:    Referee:\n Sweden       8 10 10 - 28       5*2min         6,799          Peter Andersson\n Finland     12 10 11 - 33       6*2min,1*10min                (Sweden)\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Sweden opened the scoring as Markus Naslund made a drop pass at the Finnish\n blue line, Popovic picked it up and advanced towards the Finnish goal and\n shot a nice hard wrist shot in Ketterer's top corner. Ville Siren's slap\n shot from the blue line on power play made it 1-1, and Juha Riihijarvi\n scored a nice goal in another power play when he close in front of goal\n put the puck high over Aslin, 1-2 after the first period.\n The Finns started the second period with really good pressure. Korpisalo\n made it 1-3 with another goal from close range high over Aslin. Then,\n during the Finnish pressure, Sweden turned the game around in 1:47.\n Mikael Renberg worked hard behind the Finnish goal, and passed the puck to\n Jan Larsson in front, who backhanded the puck low, 2-3. Rundqvist entered\n the Finnish zone and passed to Ahlund, and the Finnish defense let Ahlund \n skate in and take a shot that Ketterer dropped into the goal, 3-3.\n Next, Roger Hansson -behind the goal- sent the puck back to the blue line\n where Roger Akerstrom took a slap shot and Ketterer didn't see the puck since\n there was traffic in front, 4-3.\n Third period started with a nice goal by Stefan "the Shadow" Nilsson. Stefan\n and Patrik Juhlin entered the Finnish zone, Patrik passed the puck back to\n Stefan who alone with Ketterer made no mistake, 5-3.\n Then, Keijo Sailynoja show started. He reduce and equalized the lead in only\n 21 seconds! First he scored the 5-4 goal, and after that he came in alone \n with Aslin but was tripped by Aslin to get a penalty shot. Sailynoja\n made a nice penalty shot, showed forehand and put in with a low backhand shot.\n The Swedes seemed to head for a win when Mikael Renberg scored the 6-5 goal\n late in the game on a nice power play combination. Renberg waited in the slot,\n showed that he wanted the puck on the backhand side, Ahlund passed the puck\n and Renberg took a turnaround shot low in Ketterer's goal's far side.\n But Jari Korpisalo had other plans as he only 28 seconds later scored the\n game's final goal to make it 6-6. Korpisalo took a slap shot from a narrow\n angle that -maybe- Aslin should have saved.\n\n All in all, a decent game where the defense wasn't the best.\n Both teams juggled around the lines a bit in the second and third period\n to try no combinations.\n\n Renberg and Rundqvist plays well together in the Swedish team. Larsson-\n Nilsson-Juhlin best line overall again, it seems to be a working WC line.\n Stillman good on defense.\n Some players aren't good enough for the WC though. Hakan Ahlund (faell ner\n hjaelmen och jobba!), Roger Hansson, Challe Berglund, Kenny Jonsson\n will likely have to leave for NHL pros.\n\n Two-goal scorers Jari Korpisalo and Keijo Sailynoja played well in the\n Finnish team. Markus Ketterer didn't have a very good game, we've seen him\n a lot better, so Lindfors is probably Finland's starting goalie in the WC.\n I heard that Esa Tikkanen will join the Finnish team. It would be inter-\n resting to know which other pros coach Matikainen counts on for the WC.\n \n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Starting lines:\n\n 	SWEDEN					FINLAND\n\n  35.

As far as I know Dusseldorf has only one Canadian-German forward (i.e. a  player\nwho was born in Canada but now has a German passport). \nBenoit Doucet became german by marriing a german and he is going to play \nfor Germany in the WC.\n\nThe other Canada-born forwards are:\n	Peter-John Lee (has British passport)\n	Chris Valentine\n	Dale Dercatch\n	Steve Gootas\n 	Earl Spry (?)\n\nAt the moment there are only three German-born forwards coming into my mind:\n	Bernd Trunschka, Andreas Brockmann, Ernst Koepf

Farewell, Minnesota fans.  Get stuffed, Dallas Stars.\n\nAs the North Stars fade to black, I hope that Minneapolis/St. Paul are\nnot long without an NHL team.  It just seems "right" that the hotbed of\namateur hockey in the USA should have an NHL team as well.  The loss of\nthe team is certainly not the fault of the fans (though the start of the\n1989-90 season made it look real bad for a while).\n\nI wish now that I kept the North Stars cap I bought at Maple Leaf\nGardens the morning after they eliminated Montreal in 1980.  (I got it\nto spite the Montreal fans in the small town where I grew up.)  What a\nglorious season that was for the North Stars!\n\n     dwarf

The San Jose Sharks and Ottawa Senators are each on their second GM\nalready...I'd be willing to wager that both the Sharks and Senators\nwill probably see their 3rd GM's and perhaps their 4th, before we\nsee the Panthers second.
Ok guys, I need a list of the teams who have been hot or cold during the\nlast 25 games.  Doesn't need to be accurate, a rough guess will do.  I'm\nabout to enter a playoff pool and I want to know who is hot going into\nthe playoffs.  Don't need to mention Pittsburgh.  They can't get any hotter\nthan they are now.\n\n\nP.S. I need this by Sunday
How do you figure that??  When Bryan Murray took over the Wings they were\na pretty good team that was contending for the Stanley Cup but looked\nunlikely to win it.  Now they are a pretty good team that is contending for\nthe Stanley Cup but looks unlikely to win it.  A truly great GM would\nhave been able to make the moves to push the team to the upper echelon\nof the NHL and maybe win the Stanley Cup.  A good GM (like Murray) can\nmaintain the team's success but can't push them to the next level.\n\nIn the history of hockey there have been several better GM's than Murray-\nway too many to name.  Murray isn't even the best GM in the league today.\nHe fails in comparison to Sinden, Sather, Savard, Caron, Fletcher and\nQuinn in my estimation.\n\nI can't imagine how Bryan Murray can be the best GM anyone has ever seen\nin hockey- unless they have seen VERY few GM's.

He's on the Winnipeg Jets' injury list, as he has been since\n: his first NHL start against the Ottawa Senators.  He's out until\n: next year after surgery to repair a shoulder separation.\n\n: Stu Barnes might be an AHL gun for the Hawks, but he's now the third\n: line center with the Jets, and has been since mid January or so.\n\nSorry, my memory is gone. I thought that O'Neill got sent back\ndown in February but I must have been given incorrect info. I guess\nthis says it all about Moncton because Barnes is still one of\ntheir top 3 or so scorers even though he's been out since January.
Dear Ulf,\n\n	Would you possibly consider helpiMontreal Canadiens fans everywhere\nby throwing a knee-check in the direction of Denis Savard during your upcoming\ngame against Montreal? We just can't seem to win WITH him!\n\n						Thanx alot,\n						Pete H.\n\n\n:-)

Well, since the Oilers didn't win a heck of a lot of games, I'm not sure\nthey deserve and MVP ("can't win without him").  However, I'd suggest Kelly\nBuchberger instead of Dave Manson, who has had a brutal year, his pick for\nthe All-Star game notwithstanding.\n\nAs for biggest surprise, I'd say that Buchberger had higher expectations\nthis year due to his "breakthrough" year (for him) last year, so he didn't\nreally raise his game.  My suggestion would be Shjon Podein, one of the\ncallups from Cape Breton during the year.  He was quite far down on the\ndepth chart in the Oilers stable of prospects, but made a big impact on\nthe team.  He has 12 goals in his 33 games and is only -1.  Those are decent\nnumbers for a third-line player who was seemingly doomed to minor-league\noblivion.  The Oilers coaching staff likens his style to John Tonelli.\nI think he'll be on the full-time roster next year.\n\nAs for biggest disappointment, you could name any of the players the Oilers\ndumped for lousy production this year (Nicholls, Gilchrist, Tikkanen) or\neven Shayne Corson, but Mellanby isn't far off.\n\n-- \nAndrew Scott                    | andrew@idacom.hp.com\nHP IDACOM Telecom Division      | (403) 462-0666 ext. 253
] 	Anyone who really believes that the Caps can beat\n\n\nLet's be honest.  The Pens may not 'loose' one game as you\nput it, but they will definitely lose one game.  Remember,\nthe regular season doesn't mean much when it comes to \nplayoff time.  The Caps have a shot at least - the Flyers\nsure don't
Gerry Cheevers used to have a mask that had stitches painted all over\nit.
It is meaningless to compare one player's plus/minus statistic with\nanother players' out of the context of the role and the playing time\nof the players involved.    \n\nTo compare Jagr's and Francis's plus/minus is ridiculous and absurd...
The rumour was basically everywhere in Toronto based on reports\nthat Keenan has told both San Jose and Philadelphia that he\nwas no longer interested in pursuing further negotiations with\neither team. \n\nThe Ranger announcement is supposed to happen tomorrow supposedly.\n\nThe Rangers have so many veterans that they had to get a coach\nwith "weight" and a proven record...and whom they know Messier respects.
I saw a mask once that had drawings of band-aids, presumably for every puck\nthat goalie stopped with his face/head.  I can't remember who it was or even\nif it was NHL (I see quite a few AHL games here).\n\nThis is by far the funniest mask I've seen, and for me funny=cool
It may have been passed to Toronto, but I've even seen an octopus at\nthe Aud -- last year's Bruins-Sabres game.  I knew all about the\nDetroit version, but seeing at the Aud was a bit puzzling.  :-)
During the regular season, when the intensity is down, not many teams\nhave forwards who will continually go and park themselves in front of\nthe opposing teams net...and the inadequacy of the Leafs defense in\nthis regard thus didn't matter...however, the playoffs are a different\nstory...every good team is going to have players who are going to\nbecome potted plants in front of Potvin...and the Leafs relatively\nunphysical defensive core will finally be exposed as weak an inept.\n\nHard work will go a long way during the regular season...almost\nto 100 points...and the Leafs deserve credit for that...but in the \nplayoffs talent matters, because everyone begins working hard.
Actually, fired-coach George Kingston was a third of the GM\ntriumvirate.  Now that the trio is now duo (Dean Lombardi and Chuck\nGrillo), the Sharks are already on their 3rd "office of the GM". And a\n4th is likely to happen before September; they'll either add the new\ncoach to the OofGM, or name a single GM. So your wager should be\namended to read that Sharks are likely to have their 5th GM before the\nPanther's get their 2nd. Can't wait to see how the next season's NHL\nGuide and Record Book lists the GM history of the Sharks.\n\nGiven the depth of next year's draft, the expansion draft rules, and\nthe reputation of their GMs, Anaheim and Miami look pretty good as the\nfirst 90s expansion teams to win a Cup.  San Jose and Ottawa have\ninstability at the GM position, something that Philly, NYI, Edmonton,\nand Calgary did not have when they won their first Cups. Pittsburgh\ndid, but they needed a quarter century.

It's not really crap you know... only half crap ;-)   From what i \nunderstand it's very expensive to play hockey south of the border... \n(actually it's not that cheap up hear either... though once you have all the\nequipement it's not more than $300 a year... actually i haven' played in\nabout 8 years so i could be off a bit... )  In the states, where ice time\nis considerably more expensive it can cost over a thousand a year... compare \nthis to baseball and you'll see that hockey is a sport for the well-to-do...\nAnd this brings up the fact that the well-to-do in the US are majority white...\n\nBTW: what was the original question... i think it has to do with the Hispanic\ncommuntiy and playing hockey.... \n\n\n					Cheers!\n						i.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I finally got it back, with great thanks to Mark Spiegel for saving and sending\nit.\n\n\n\n#2	ROB ZETTLER		Season:	4th\nAcquired:	'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft\nGrade:		C/C-\n\nZettler gave the Sharks every bit he's got this year; unfortunately, this still\nwasn't enough to make him any more than a marginal NHLer, if that.  He works\nhard, for sure, but is no better than average on defense, and is prone to\ncostly penalties and defensive lapses at times, while being basically an\noffensive zero (0 goal and 7 assists in 79 games).  He would be hardpressed\nto make the team next year.\n\n#3	DAVID WILLIAMS		Season: 2nd\nAcquired:	'91-92, free agent from New Jersey\nGrade:		C/C-\n\nIMO, Williams was the most valuable defenseman for the Sharks in '91-92,\nplaying a combination of good offense (3 goals and 25 assists in 56 games) and\ngood defense.  But he, playing the first part of this season in Kansas City,\nwas good neither offensively nor defensively this year; it, then, appears that\n'91-92 was a fluke.  Although he improved towards the end of the season, he\nwas prone to being out of position defensively, and did not demonstrate the\nplaymaking skills that made him the team's leading scorer among defensemen last\nyear.  He would also be hardpressed to make the team next year.\n\n#4	JAYSON MORE		Season: 2nd\nAcquired:	'91-92, from Montreal in expansion draft\nGrade:		B+\n\nAfter being touted as the team's top defensive prospects in training camp\nbefore '91-92, More had a rather disappointing '91-92, as he was not\nparticularly good defensively, and had just 17 points in 46 games.  He, then,\nproceeded to improve his game massively this season, becoming the team's most\nreliable defenseman, whom the team can count on night in and night out to play\nsteady defense and providing occasional (but only occasional) offensive flash.\nOffensively, he was even more disappointing than last year (11 points in 73\ngames), but his defense improved tremendously.  He is probably best as the\ndefensive part of a defense combination with an offensive defenseman.\n\n#5	NEIL WILKINSON		Season: 4th\nAcquired:	'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft\nGrade:		B-\n\nWilkinson was probably the team's top defensive defenseman in '91-92.  However,\npartially because of injuries, he was not the same this year, as he missed 25\ngames total due to nagging knee and back injuries, and seemed to be slowed\neven when playing.  He, then, had often to be saved by his defensive partners;\nthat is, if they are there at all.  But he also had some solid games, and if\nhe can be complete healthy, he can still be a force.\n\n#6	SANDIS OZOLINSH		Season: 1st\nAcquired:	'91-92, 2nd round pick in entry draft\nGrade:		I (A)\n\nAt the time of his injury (December 30, against the Philadelphia Flyers),\nOzolinsh was well on track to be, IMO, the team's MVP.  A serious knee injury\nin that game, though, forced him to miss the rest of the season (47 games),\nbut he still finished as the team's top scorer among defensemen (23 points),\nwhich, of course, tells more about the lack of offense the Sharks had from\ntheir defensemen, but it also tells of Ozolinsh's abilities.  At the time, he\nwas playing very good defense along with excellent offense; he was still\nsusceptible to so-called "rookie mistakes," but was probably the defenseman who\nmade the least of them on the team, rookie or veteran.  If he can come back\nfrom his injuries, he is ready to be a star.\n\n#19	DOUG ZMOLEK		Season: 1st\nAcquired:	'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft\nGrade:		B\n\nZmolek had basically a solid and durable year, being one of the only two Sharks\nto play in all 84 games of the season.  He was solid on defense, but\nafter being billed as an offensive defenseman, he didn't show it (15 points).\nHe was also prone to penalties, and his 229 penalty minutes was second on the\nteam; however, that was also an indication that he was fearly when facing tough\nphysical opponents, and he was at his best when playing physically.  But to\nbecome a fixture in this league, he needs to improve both offensively and\ndefensively, and cut down on the number of power-plays he gives to opponents.
Another person incapable of rational thought!
This is known as the Savard syndrome - and we are talking Denis, not Serge.\nNo team will ever win squat with the likes of Denis Savard in their lineup.\n\n\nThey could tell Savard to stay home and watch the games on TV.\n\n\n\nSounds like #12 to me.\n\ncordially, as always, \n\nrm
Buffalo seems to have started a tradition of trading its captains.\n\nPat LaFontaine was awarded the Captaincy when Mike Ramsey was forced\nto give it up (Ramsey's now a Penguin).  Ramsey inherited it from Mike\nFoligno (who's now a leaf).  He in turn had inherited it from Lindy\nRuff, who went I forget where.  Ruff had it from Perreault, who\nretired, so I guess that's where the streak started.  Or did it?\nAfter all, Danny Gare was captain before him, and he went to Detroit.\nJim Scoenfeld, Gerry Meehan, and Floyd Smith are the others, in\nreverse order, last to first.  I was a bit young at the time, so I'm\nnot sure of the fate of Schoenfeld, but he ultimately went to Detroit\nand Boston.  Meehan went to Vancouver, Atlanta and Washington.  Smith\nseems to have hung up his skates after Buffalo, but I don't know if\nthe captaincy was removed before or after that, or how many games he\nplayed for Buffalo.  This is actually getting fascinating.  :-)\n\nCaptaincy in Buffalo is a sure sign you're to be traded, almost,\nunless you're a franchise player.
Re Eric: True, but fortunately we didn't get to find out what they would be\nlike without Recchi for 30 games.\n\nSoderstrom: Absolutely. 4 shutouts in 39 games for a rookie without a lot\nof defense in front of him. Runnerups to Galley and Fedyk who are scoring\na ton over their career best. But Galley thinks he's Paul Coffey (puts scoring\nahead of defending) and Fedyk has tailed off big time.\n\nEklund: Was a big question mark this year and was coming off injuries. 42\npoints in 49 games is not bad at all, and recently he's been a huge factor\nin the wins they've gotten. Eklund has never had a point a game season in\nhis career, his production is very typical for him. How does he qualify as\na disappointment? If anything he's a surprise.\n\nMy choice would be Roussel if I went strictly by what was expected of players,\nbut I never thought that he had what it takes to be a #1 goalie. My biggest\ndisappointment is Bill Dineen. I thought that he was going to be the perfect\ncoach for this young team, instead he's made too many bad moves and IMHO\nhas cost them enough games to keep them out of the playoffs this year. Any\ncoach that thinks putting Eric Lindros at the point on power plays is a\nbright idea needs to go back to coaching school.
The Hawks won the Norris div, and sealed their fate.  It's bad luck\nto win the Norris.  The Hawks will sweep the Blues in their dreams but will\nlose in 6 in reality.  I predict that in the 6 game with the Blues Belfour\nwill go down on his knees 7000 time s and will spend the rest of the time \nlooking behind him self.  Butcher will pound Roenick and The warthawks have\nno one tough enough to prevent it
Then allow me to enlighten you, Rex. You see, there's a thing called a tie. \nA tie is worth one point (I know, I know. You're not good at math. But bear\nwith me). A win is worth two points. So, getting two ties is the same as \ngetting one win. If your team played two games, won one and lost one, you'd\nhave two points. If my team played two games and tied them both, we'd also\nhave two points. We'd be tied in the standings even though our records are\ndifferent.\n\nPerhaps you should learn something about hockey before posting again. (I am\nstarting to sound like Roger or what?)
I thought that he was comparing Cullen to TEEMU SEL[NNE. I always thought\n  that salami is some sort of sausage, BUT IF YOU, dear Roger, ARE ABLE TO\n  SEE SALAMI ON THE ICE PLAYING HOCKEY... I don't know what to do, but you\n  surely should do something and very quickly!!!\n\n  Maybe you think that if you keep on talking some rubbish, after some time\n  everybody will consider it to be really true... You should take care of\n  your LEAFS, they surely need it more.\n  \n\n  At least we have seen him playing... \n\n During the latest Philly game the Leaf players didn't parade... Philly\n crunched them 4-0 !!!  Maybe you need some more two way players who can\n score, too !!???\n\n  just cordially,\n\n  Hannu
Yup. I agree with ya. I think Devils can beat Red Wings easily. SO I think\n  all those who send in their votes should try all these diffrent teams\n  before voting. I think Islanders and Quebec are much better then I had\n  expected.\n\n  COBRA

When\n   >you add to that Jagr's better +/- rating, I think it becomes evident\n   >that Jagr had a better season- not that Francis had a bad one.\n   >\n\n     Actually, what I think has become more evident, is that you are determined to\n     flaunt your ignorance at all cost.  Jagr did not have a better season than\n     Francis ... to suggest otherwise is an insult to those with a modicum of\n     hockey knowledge.  Save your almost maniacal devotion to the almighty\n     plus/minus ... it is the most misleading hockey stat available.\n\n     Until the NHL publishes a more useful quantifiable statistic including ice\n     time per game and some measure of its "quality" (i.e., is the player put out\n     in key situations like protecting a lead late in the game; is he matched up\n     against the other team's top one or two lines; short-handed, etc), I would\n     much rather see the +/- disappear altogether instead of having its dubious\n     merits trumpeted by those with little understanding of its implications.\n\nThank you for posting this.  As the person who first brought up the\nfact that Jagr has a much higher +/- than Francis, I can assure you\nthat I brought it up as an example of the absurdity of +/-\ncomparisons, even on the same team.  I never, ever thought that anyone\nwould argue that Jagr's higher +/- actually reflected better two-way\nplay.\n\nIn my opinion, Francis's low +/- is purely a result of him being asked\nto play against opponents top scorers at all times; the fact that he\ncan chip in 100 points while neutralizing the other team's top center\nis a testament to how valuable he is, even if his +/- suffers.  On the\nother hand, Jagr, for how big, fast and skilled he is, can't even get\n90 points, no matter how inflated his +/- is.\n\n(By the way, don't get me wrong -- I like Jagr.  He may be a lazy\nfloater, but he turns it on at exactly the right times -- like\novertime of playoff games).

You should be ashamed to call yourself an Ulf Samuelson fan. Anybody who plays\nthe way he does, does not belong in the NHL. There have been cheap shot artists\nthrough the history of the game, but a lot of them have been talanted players.\nBobby Clarke, Kenny Linsemen, Pie McKenzie, Chris Chelios etc.. but nobody has been\nout right as dirty a cheapshot coward as Ulf. Violence in hockey has got to be curbed\nand players like (Should have been a Women) Samuelson don't belong. When players\nlike Ulf, who's main purpose is to injure the better players in the league is allowed\nto continue, and the league won't stop it, the players should. A Christian Pro 1000\naluminum stick directed at his ugly head should do the trick nicely. If the Bruins get\na chance to meet Pittsburgh in the near future, you can bet Neely will have his day.\nThe sight of watching Ulf turtle up like the coward he is, is worth almost as much as a\nStanely Cup. This wimp of a player almost ruined the career of one the best right wingers\nin the game. If you are to remove Ulf Samuelson from the lineup, the Penguins would not\neven notice he's gone. He's an eyesore on the game of hockey.

Oh no!  Say it isn't so!\n\n\nYes, Yl|nen is a draft choice of the Jets.  (Assuming, of course, this\nis the same Yl|nen that played for Kiekko-Espoo in 1990-91.)  He was a\n5th round, 91st overall pick of the Jets in the 1991 entry draft.\n\nI noticed in the summaries that Yl|nen had really begun to play well in\nthe playoffs.
I'm in Edmonton, and while that's usually (or at least OFTEN) the case,\nhere we were "treated" to the actual ABC telecast of the Kings/Flames\ngame.  I'm with whoever said it earlier - Don Witless (er, Whitman) is\na poor commentator, and not just for hockey.  Normally, if the Oilers\nwere still playing (augh), I would turn off the sound and listen to \nthe radio broadcast to get decent play-by-play announcing.
Why not? I believe both the Devils and Islanders got 87 points.\nSay for example, another team had this record : 20-37-47;\nthey had 20*2+47*1+37*0=87 which is the same as their points total.\n(The Islanders' and Devils' records are both 40-37-7.\n\nIt is simple arithmetics and involve no Calculus.

C'mon, Tommy Soderstrom is having a fine rookie (I think he's a rookie)\nseason with the Flyers. I'm sure most of you knew that already, but just\nin case.
* The Keenan hiring is precipitated by the loss of an anticipated $5M\nin playoff revenue and fears of losing season ticket-holders (!), plus\nParamount chief Stan Jaffe's chip against the Flyers over l'Affaire\nLindros last autumn.  Add to this that Neilsen might return as an\nassistant coach [Gerald, what'd I say earlier today??], and Roger\nconferred with Jaffe on the hiring.  This hiring by Jaffe went over\nthe head of MSG, Inc. (Par. subsidiary) head Bob Gutkowski and over\nthe head and the protests of Pres./GM Neil Smith.\n\n* MSG is making the announcement on Saturday to get back at the\nIslanders for making the playoffs (i.e., steal the press).\n\n* Flyers owner Ed Snyder is livid and beside himself over this.\n\n* Keenan will make up to $900,000/yr.\n\n* Gary Bettman has appointed an independent consul to look at\nGil Stein's admission into the Hall of Fame.\n\n* New crease colours, rather than blue?\n\n* The Oilers will charge to eat in the Press Room next year.\n\ngld

And now, I interrupt your regularly scheduled news reading to bring you \nanother message sponsored by the Department of Really Mundane Statistics:\n\nI passed the final individual player stats posted here the other day through\na filter to average out games, goals, assists, points, and penalty minutes\nfor the mythical average NHL pro who played in the league this season. (Why?\nBecause it's Monday and I didn't feel like writing any REAL code...)\n\nAnyway, after I wiped out the 60-odd goalies in the list, I came up with:\n\nNHL average:		55 GP      11 G      19 A      30 Pts      69 PIM\n\nThen I passed the list through a second time to come up with the players who\nhad the smallest percentage difference in each of the categories.\n\nMarty McInnis (NYI)	56 GP (1%) 10 G (9%) 20 A (5%) 30 Pts (0%) 24 PIM (65%)\nIgor Kravchuk (EDM)	55 GP (0%) 10 G (9%) 17 A (10%) 27 Pts (9%) 27 PIM (53%)\n\nThese two are close in games, goals, assists, and points, but are too far off\nin PIM. This leaves, as the most average player in the NHL:\n\nBobby Carpenter (WAS)	65 GP (18%) 11 G (0%) 17 A (10%) 28 Pts (6%) 63 PIM (8%)\n\nWhat an honor.\n\nI also passed the list through with the goalies still included. Kravchuk and\nCarpenter were still in the top three, but Rob DiMaio came flying up from \nbehind to take the title:\n\nNHL average:		53 GP      10 G      17 A      27 Pts      64 PIM\nIgor Kravchuk (EDM)     55 GP (3%) 10 G (0%) 17 A (0%) 27 Pts (0%) 27 PIM (50%)\nBobby Carpenter (WAS)   65 GP (22%) 11 G (10%) 17 A (0%) 28 Pts (3%) 63 PIM (1%)\nRob DiMaio (TB)		54 GP (1%) 9 G (9%) 15 A (11%) 24 Pts (11%) 62 PIM (3%)\n\n\nIt's all really kind of underwhelming when you think about it.\n\n-SG

Well, actually now that you mention it, a few weeks ago the CBC ran a\ndocumentary on "Ice Hockey in Harlem".  the Canadian Club of New York\n(something like that) sponsors a league for kids in Harlem and based on\nthe TV report they all seemed to be having a lot of fun.  All playing\nwith regular equipment, jerseys, etc etc, on a proper outdoor rink.  It\nlooked just like kids playing hockey anywhere else.

Ruotsaleinen was a more than competent NHL'er...his choice of where\nto play when did not bear on his hockey playing ability.\n\nHe was crucial to the Oilers Stanley Cup victory in 1990, the one\nwithout Gretzky, because he made an Oiler power play which was\nlethargic that year until he arrived slide into overdrive.  The\nOilers missed him more the following year than Kurri, and I think\nthe Oilers would have make the finals if Ruotsaleinen has stayed\naround the following season, and would have beaten Pittsburgh\nwith Ruotsaleinen and a healthy Messier...and delayed Pittsburgh's\ndynasty by a season.
I hear Daigle will eb the first pick next year. What is the word on Kariya???\nAnybody ever seen him play on TV???? Is he also entering the draft???
I've been watching & playing hockey for a good long time now, and\nI've seen players with questionable tactics, but never have I seen\nwhat Ray did on Sunday. This guy gets my all time loser award. It's\none thing to repeatedly cross check someone to the back of the neck\nwhen they are down, it's another thing to have a fist fight with\nsomeones balls. Ray should be thrown out of the league, what an\na**hole.
Here is a summary of Don Cherry's coach's corner from April 18, 1993.\nIt took place in the first intermission of game 1 of the Montreal-Quebec\nseries. \n\nPre-game comments\n-----------------\nDon's pregame comments were mostly aimed at the goalies... The goalie\nwho gets back his all-star form (Roy or Hextall) can win the series\nfor his team.\n\nEposode Summary\n---------------\nThis episode took place rinkside. Don was holding a hot dog that\nhe bought from the concession stand.\n\nRon Maclean started out by showing a cartoon which appeared in the\nToronto Sun. It featured a picture of Don, who just saw his shadow\nand proclaimed "Will you look at dat, eh? Means another 6 weeks\nof me. Beauty."\n\nNext, Don talked about the hot dog he was holding. According to\nhim, the hot dogs at the Quebec stadium are the best food in all\nthe arenas in the NHL.\n\nFrom there, Don commented on the Quebec-Montreal game. The game\nhad great flow, because Referee Paul Stewart calls the best game\nin the NHL. In contrast, the Calgary-LA game was terrible... All\nstop-and-go, over 50 minutes of penalties called against Calgary\nby Dan Marouelli. Its getting so that the ref who calls the most\npenalties gets to ref in the finals.\n\nNext, Ron showed an old picture of Don, when he was playing for\nthe Rochester Americans of the AHL. Don recalled some of the\nwins that he had in the Quebec arena... during the Memorial cup\nand the AHL championships.\n\nFinally, Don and Ron discussed Keenan becoming coach of the\nRangers. The rangers were a talented team who underachieved.\nDon feels sorry for temporary coach Ron Smith, who had\nseveral key injuries (to Leetch and Patrick) and goalies who\nwent cold.\n\nDon had some criticism for the Rangers team... The party's over,\nAdolf (Keenan) is there. The Rangers organization will no longer\nbe a 'country club'.... "NY should be achamed of themselves... If\nthey go in the tank with Adolf there, they'll be hanging from the\nyardarm by their thumbs."\n\n\nRating\n------\nNothing too special in this episode.\n\nI'll give it a 5.5 out of 10.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n   \  \                   |Allan Sullivan (allan@cs.ualberta.ca)\n    \  \                  |Department of Computing Science,\n     \  \_______          |University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.\n      \    ###  \     _   |---------------------------------------------------\n       \___###___\   (_)  |My opinions are mine and mine alone.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n"It is amazing how much can be accomplished if no one cares who gets the\n credit..."          - U. of A.

: What are the Leafs to do?  I am a Leaf supporter and\n: I say the Leafs are going down in four unless there\n: is nothing short of a miracle or a stroke of genenius hits\n\nRoot for another team. ;-)\n\n: Andreychuck and Borchevsky have no business playing against \n: the Wings.  They are too small.  The key to any Leafs success\n: will have to be Clark.  He is the only centre who can have\n..\nAndreychuk, is NOT small, slow and sloth-like, maybe, but he is\nabout 6'4" and that is not what I would consider as small.\n\nAs an aside, The big AndreyCHUNK as I call him has been known to\ndisappear come playoff time.  This was one of his main problems when\nplaying for Buffalo.\n\n: GO LEAFS !!!\nGO SABRES !!!
With the kind of team Montreal has now,  they can take the\ncup easily.  The only problem they have right now is that everyone is\ntrying to steal the show and play alone.  They need some massive teamwork.\n	They are also in a little of a slump because long-time hockey\nMontreal Canadiens announcer Claude Mouton died last tuesday and it was\nrough on everybody because he has worked with the organization for 21\nyears.  But I know that is no excuse.  But if the Habs manage to get some\ngood teamwork and get into the spirit,  they should have no problem\nwinning in May.
Well, I'm a Wings fan and I think the FIRST thing that you should do is to\nget the opponent's line combinations correct before you try to match up anyone\nwith them.  There is no Yzerman-Fedorov-Probert line, except for maybe on a\npowerplay.  These three players usually play on three different lines.\nWhich would mean that Toronto's checking line would have to pull a triple\nshift.\nThe Wings' lines usually look like this:\n \n                      Gallant-Yzerman-Ciccarelli\n \n                      Kozlov-Fedorov-Drake\n \n                      Kennedy-Burr-Probert\n \n                      Ysebaert-Primeau-Sheppard\n \nOh by the way:  Start praying! : )
I got back from my trip to discover that my email spool file got blown\naway.  I am missing all the playoff pool entries sent between April 5\nand April 17.  It looks like about 200 entries got lost.  *Sigh*.\n\nTherefore, I would like to ask each person that sent me a team to resend\nit ASAP.  I am relying on your honesty to not make changes after the\ndeadline today.\n\nThanks in advance, and I apologize for the problem.\n\n-- \nAndrew Scott                    | andrew@idacom.hp.com\nHP IDACOM Telecom Operation     | (403) 462-0666 ext. 253
Here is my traditional experience with tickets, playoffs and otherwise,\nat the Civic Arena.\n\n     Scalping is illegal but nonetheless present outside the Arena.  Best \nstrategy, given that you don't mind missing the Anthem (which is OK if B.E.\nTaylor decides to come back ever again :) ) is to wait until 7:40 or 7:45,\nwhen the game is rolling; the scalpers are at this point desperate to sell\nand will reduce to near or at face value to get rid of their tickets.\n\n     Playoffs are a little different in that good seats will go early on; \nwhat's left at 7:45 may be nosebleed material (D, E sections).\n\nOthers can add on their opinions as well.
Uh, Gerald, I think he was joking...
These new rule changes are great!  However, I think that your rules are\nMUCH too complicated.  How will the normal average fan be able to count\nhow many fouls a player has?  And then we would even have to remember the\nnames of the players, in order to determine who drew the foul!  And, of\ncourse, there will have to be new "sub-positions", like the power center\nwho just sits in the slot until the (blue, of course) puck comes near him,\nand the "shooting defenseman" and the "point defenseman".  Finally, we'll\nbe able to keep stats on the best and the worst penalty-shot takers. \nSince almost everyone on the ice will be getting fouled, we'll be able to\nsee Ulf Samuellson (sp?) and Tie Domi miss penalty shots like crazy.  \n\n;-) ;-) ;-)\n\n--\n    Keith Keller				LET'S GO RANGERS!!!!!\n						LET'S GO QUAKERS!!!!!\n	kkeller@mail.sas.upenn.edu		IVY LEAGUE CHAMPS!!!!
Dale Hunter ties the game, scoring his third goal of the game\nwith 2.7 seconds remaining in regulation.\n\n     You could feel it coming on.\n\n     "Due to contractual agreements, ESPN will be unable to carry\nthe rest of this game live, so that we may show you a worthless\nearly-season battle between those two pennant contenders, the \nCleveland Indians and the California Angels.  When the winning\ngoal is scored, we WILL do the grave injustice of breaking into the\nbaseball game -- something reserved only for the deaths of Presidents\nor the trading of Joe Montana to the Chiefs -- to show you the \ngoal on instant replay.\n     "Aren't you SO lucky to have national coverage of hockey?"\n\n     It's HEIDI all over again, dammit!
Does anyone know if there will be alternate games in cities where local\nbroadcast rights are being protected?  I'd really love to see the Bruins a\ncouple times, and with this pro-Patrick bias shown by ESPN something tells me\nthat I will have to wait until the conference finals to see them :-}.\n\n-JPC\n \n--
Us easterners who have newspapers with editors\nunsympathetic to playoff pools, often don't get\nsummaries from west coast games since they\nfinish too late at night for the morning edition.\n\nI (and I'm sure others too) would greatly appreciate\nit if scoring summaries of west coast playoff games\ncould be posted to this group right away.\nbasically, all we need are goal scorers and assists,\ndon't bother with times, penalties, shots etc...\n\nthis would make a lot of pool-obsessed people very\nhappy.\n\nI guess with the Senators out golfing now, the \nlocal papers have lost interest.  ;-)\n\nthanks.\n\nkd.
I loved the ABC coverage. The production was excellent. The appearance\nwas excellent. It had a sleek modern look. This was the first time I heard\nThorne & Clement & I thought they were great. My only request is to leave\nAl Micheals out of this. He annoys me. \n	I'm hoping this leads to a regular-season contract. My guess would\nbe is that it will be roughly a weekly game from Feb.-April and then the \nplayoffs. I envy you Canadians with your TSN & CBC. Maybe I'll get a dish\nto pick up Canadian TV. How much are those things, BTW?
Ah yes.  California.  Did the San Francisco Bay area media report that\nJoe Montana is rumoured to be the leading candidate to replace fired\nSan Jose Sharks coach George Kingston?  Apparently Montana is not only\ncoveted for his winning attitude, but as a playing coach he will be\nexpected to quarterback the powerplay.\n\nGood thing those walls are so soft, eh Rollie?\n\n\n--
But only in NY,NJ, Philadelphia, and Chicago. Everywhere else, the only\nreason SportsChannel was available was for local baseball broadcasts.\nAnd local baseball pre-empted the NHL playoffs. Thus far into this\nplayoff season, ESPN/ABC has given me more hockey in 2 days (1 game)\nthan SportsChannel did (0 games).\n\nIf people want hockey on TV, they should watch hockey on TV. I bet the\nratings for hockey on Sunday on ABC went into the toilet. Next week, there\nwill be far fewer ABC affiliates with hockey.\n\nSomeone in this thread said that he wouldn't watch the games even if\nthey were on TV, and this is a r.s.h. regular contributor!\n\nXenophobes north of border needn't fear the US-Americanization of "our"\ngame, because US-Americans will never figure out how to market hockey\nhere. Support your team; support your game.
--Minnesota definitely deserves an NHL franchise!!!  You'll see the\nMinnesota Whalers pretty soon, so fear not Minnesota fans.  No Norm Green,\n'cept for the team color (sorry, bad pun!)\n\n   --What a difference two years makes!  Minnesota finished 29-37-14 in 1992\nand made the finals.  They finish with a better record at  38-38-10 thi year\nand move to Dallas.  Every team in the playoffs has a winning record!!!\nFinally!!!  It's about time, NHL!!!
Yes, a point well-taken ... however, even in areas that finally got\nsome games, there's something nagging in the back of your skull when\nthe network that has the national rights in its pocket says on its\nsports news, "There's an awesome overtime going on in Quebec City,\nand we'll *try* to get you an update through the show ..." when you\nknow that it's on a satellite's feedhorn somewhere up there ...\n\n\nFrom today's Times, ABC got great ratings in Chicago and St. Louis (a\n4.2), and the Kings-Flames got a 2.9 on the West Coast, but only a 2.2\nin metro New York (i.e., the Devils squandered their newfound support\nfrom a year ago when they played the Rangers )-;).  In comparison,\nSeniors Golf did better ...\n\n\nI fear that the overall national numbers will not be so great ...\nI can't tell if ABC did any advance marketing or not, 'cos I don't\nwatch much TV ... the NHL should have made sure that it was solid\non cable before going on the air.  Even ESPN could've sold second\nrights to third party systems (i.e., non-SportsChannel) since they\nare not making any extra money by sitting on the games ... hockey\nfans will not necessarily be watching pre-season beach volleyball\nif playoffs games aren't being shown somewhere ...\n\ngld
This is the new Buffalo one, the second since he's been with the\nSabres?  I recall a price tag of over $700 just for the paint job on\nthat mask, and a total price of almost $1500.  Ouch.
Well, the Patrick Division got a little more interesting last night. \nThe Islanders lost in OT and the Devils tied the Pens.  That means if the Isles\nbeat the Devils on Friday, the will meet the Caps in the playoffs.\n\n	However, I have some more comments on the Islanders and hockey in\ngeneral that I need to get off my chest :).  First of all, with the Islanders \nback-to-back lackluster performances against the Whalers, one may think that \nthe Islanders are out of shape.  These guys always suck wind in the 2nd period,\ncome on a little in the 3rd and run out of gas too soon.  It is unbelieveable\nhow many one goal games these guys have lost.  Anyway, the games was pretty \nwide open.  The Isles still have tons of trouble scoring.  The Whalers played \na golie in is 1st NHL start, I think his name was Lenarduzzi (sp?).  (His NHL \ndebut was the Tuesday tie against the Isles).  Like I mentioned before, this \nguy looked like the best golie on the planet for a while (until he misplayed a \nMahlakov slap shot to go to OT).  I say it's because the Isles don't shoot \ncorrectly.  Has anyone else noticed this?\n\n	Also, I think it is really a shame for hockey when I guy like Mick\nVukota gets as much ice time as he does.  This guy has about as much hockey\ntalent as Jiggs MacDonald (who did play hockey, I think).  Anytime he gets the\npuck it gets stolen, and he always starts fights and gets needless penalties. \nRichard Pilon is another guy who is on the ice to stir up crap.  And he's a\ndefenseman.  He's got to be approaching negative infinity for his plus/minus. \nThis guy gets beaten all the time.  Why the need for such "enforcers"?  Not\nonly do fights slow the game down ALOT, but it takes away from the guys who are\nreally trying to play the game.  I'll be one of the few to admit, I do enjoy a \ngood fight once in a while, but only when it's "called for".  You know, when a\nguy checks the goalie too hard.  In other words, a violation of "hockey ethics"\nmight cause you to get puched.  But there is no need to start crap when you are\nlosing or becuase you can get away with it!! Does anyone agree that referees\nneed to be a little less lenient in the 3rd and OT?  I mean COME ON already. \nI'm sick of seeing teams pulling guys down, holding guys etc. just becuase the\nreferee doesn't call it.  OT and late in the 3rd should be a time for strategy,\nnot physical prowess.  Trying to set up a goal should be first and foremost. \nIf you are so afraid that the other team is going to score that you have to\npull a guy down to prevent it, you don't deserve to win in the first place.\n\nJust My Honest Opinion,

For those Leaf fans who are concerned, the following players are slated for\nreturn on Thursday's Winnipeg-Toronto game :\n    Peter Zezel, John Cullen\n\n  Mark Osborne and Dave Ellett are questionable to return on Thursday.
[... stuff deleted ...]\n\nI have to agree here.  As I heard on TSN tonight, "You want to pick\nsomeone else, but you just don't see how you can".  And I'm a Bruins\nfan.  Maybe this year will be different, but it doesn't look good.\nTime will tell, though.\n\n[... lots more deleted ...]\n\nRandy
I'll have to disagree with you on this one. I think Vancouver will go as\nBure goes, and if he continues on his goal scoring slump, then they\nwon't even make it out of the first round. I think the Kings will make\nit out of the first round, regardless of who they play. They seem to be\ndoing pretty well, even with that bad game against Minnesota on\nSaturday. I think it'll be either Calgary or Los Angeles to win the\nSmythe (i.e. go on to the conference finals).
<In response to a debate about who has has a better season- Jagr of Francis>\n\nI think Jagr did he probably had a better point per minute ice time- stats\ndon't exist to properly analyze this and he had a substancially better +/-.\n\n\n\n+/- is a useful statistic.  If a player is on the ice when his team scores a\nlot of goals and only allows a few goals, he must be doing something right.\nIt is especially useful to compare between teammates- as they play for the\nsame team and should have roughly similar +/- ratings if they are equally\ngood players.  It can be adjusted- with varying degrees of success to compare\nbetween players on different teams.\n\nI agree it would be nice for the NHL to keep more statistics- but how useful\nare the ones that you suggest??  Total ice time would be very useful- it is\na missing stat in Jagr vs Francis arguments from before.  Somehow measuring\nthe quality of ice time as you suggest would be useless.  It would be a\nbetter stat for evaluating coaching- ie are the players given quality ice\ntime actually their talented ones?  A very good player could be given low\namounts of quality ice time because of team depth or a stupid coach who\ndoesn't recognize his talent and a very bad player could be given lots of\nquality ice time because of a lack of team depth or a stupid coach that\nthinks he is an effective player.  This stat would be much more flawed than\n+/- and almost no conclusions could be drawn regarding player talent.\n\n+/- is a useful stat.  It is quite useful in evaluating player talent.\nYou are the one displaying ignorance because of your unwillingness to see\nthat being on the ice when goals are scored but not when they are allowed\nis a very positive thing- and should be evaluated as such.
: It is meaningless to compare one player's plus/minus statistic with\n: another players' out of the context of the role and the playing time\n: of the players involved.    \n\n: To compare Jagr's and Francis's plus/minus is ridiculous and absurd...\n\n: Gerald\n\nThank you for putting this in perspective!
Obviously some reporter for the Ottawa Sun got taken by an April\nFools joke...probably started by someone with the Nordiques or the\nBruins.  \n\nLike for example...who is going to reimburse the Flyers for the\n$15 million they paid to the Nordiques...like the Senators are\ngoing to get Lindros and $15 million.  The Flyers sent the\nequivalent of 6 or 7 players (when you include the draft choices)\nto Quebec, and they are going to get only four back.\n\nSome reporter was had real badly and someone must be having a\nreal good laugh seeing as how the so much of the sports media\nhas chosen to publicize this utter nonsense.\n\n\nCan you think...it cannot possibly be true...no need for the "if"!\n\n\nI can't believe that anyone would consider giving such crap even\nthe remotest consideration.
It's the "opening-game effect" maybe. Pros arrive late, nervousness for\n rookie WC players, and problems to get the lines clicking may make things\n hard to get it going against these "worse" nations.\n I'd guess that the better team you face in the opening game, the better\n it is, since the chances of an upset are greater then.\n\n Some other reasons why the "worse" teams are so tough to beat was presented\n by Hans "Virus" Lindberg (former coach in Switzerland).\n\n 1) The "worse" teams (referring to France, Switzerland, Austria, Italy etc)\n    have now usually world class goalies.\n\n 2) Their defensive play have become much more disciplined, they take much\n    less unnecessary penalties.\n\n 3) They use four lines which makes it harder to make them "run out of gas."\n\n 4) The ice quality in the German WC rinks is poor.\n\n Another weird thing was that the Czechs played entertaining hockey..\n err.. just kidding, David.\n\n Alex? That's a new name for me ;)\n\n OK, I forgot the Czech roster at home yesterday, but now I have it.\n I don't know the teams for all players, so I would appreciate if\n you guys could fill in the blanks for me (especially I think some\n of these players play in Finland).\n\n The Czech Republic\n ------------------\n\n Goaltenders:	 1.

It's just as meaningless to compare goals, assists, PIM and any other stat I\ncan think of.  Each player is asked to take a unique role for his team.  The\ncontexts will never be the same from one player to another playing on the\nsame team or different teams.  And yet ... awards are given and promotions\nreceived based in part on these meaningless stats.  The operative words are\n"in part" - stats must be interpreted, tempered with other information one\nhas about the player.  \n\n\n\nAnd comparing Jagr's and Francis's points is just as ridiculous and absurd...\nbut not more ridiculous and absurd as comparing goals, assists, points, +\-\nfor Selanne, Lindros, Juneau, Potvin, and the other rookies in the league...\nand yet...\n\nHow about looking at them for what they are and enjoy the game.
Actually, this part was really interesting.  It turns out that the mask is\ncustom-fit to the goalie's face.  The goalie puts his/her face through a\npiece of wood (or was it plastic?) with a hole in it that allows only the face\nand forehead to show.  Hair is covered by a cap, eyes are covered by a plastic\nwrap-type material, and vaseline is put on the goaltender's face.  Then, a\nplaster is spread on their cheeks, forehead, and chin which takes about 12\nminutes to dry sufficiently.  When it dries, it is effectively a mold of the\ngoalie's face.  This is used as the basis of the mask (the rest involves\npadding the inside, hardening the exterior, fitting the cage, etc. etc.  \nJohn Blue of the Bruins actually demonstrated the procedure on the show. \n\n\nYeah, Essensa's mask looked really good.\n \n\nActually, I thought I heard him say that it _was_ Potvin's for certain.  I\nwould bet money on it either way...and it did look awesome!
After reading some of the reports of possible NHL moves to Milwaukee or that\nMilwaukee should have an NHL team, I thought I'd pass along a story I heard\nrecently.  This is second hand, so I don't know how true it is, but I have\nno reason to doubt it either.\n\nBradley Center in Milwaukee is home to the Milwaukee Admirals minor leauge\nhockey team.  The owner of the Admirals (sorry, I can't remember his name)\neither owns or at least shelled out the majority of the funds to build the\nBradley Center.\n\nSupposedly he was approached by the NHL about an expansion franchise, but \nturned it down because he thought the franchise fee of $50 million was too\nhigh.\n\nLike I said, I don't know whether this story is true or just a rumor, but if\nit's true, don't look for an NHL team in Milwaukee anytime soon.  The Admirals\naren't going to be forced out of the building and you won't see an NHL club\nand a minor league club in the same building, especially since the NBA's\nMilwaukee Bucks play there as well.
According to what reasonable principle of justice does standing in intimate\ngeographical and psychological relations to a league give one some privileged\nright to play in it?
Obviously, it is ultimately the teams choice...the NHL would obviously\nprefer not to annoy the European hockey federations, but the NHL right\nnow cannot force NHL teams to free their players...the Whalers probably\ndid it this way so as to not annoy their farm team affiliate.
Kovalev is too talented a player to play for Roger Nielson...Roger needs\nplayers who can't think for themselves and can only skate in straight\nlines up and down the ice.  Dudley and Nielson are the only two coaches\nbad enough in the league to take talents like Mogilny and Kovalev and\nnot know how to turn them into Bure and Selanne.\n\n\nGet Muckler as coach, and Kovalev will look like Mogilny.\n\nThe trouble with the Rangers is that Neil Smith went out and got\nplayers like Messier, Kovalev, and Graves who have been schooled in\ntaking the game to their opponent and attacking, while hiring coaches\nwho are interested in "rope-a-dope" strategies.  If you want the\nRoger Nielsons of the world to be your coach you don't go out and\nget a Mark Messier, who is an old dog who can't learn new tricks\nfrom a known loser, and you don't waste your draft picks on players\nlike Kovalev.\n\nGerald
That's why we have expansion - to create more jobs. NHL teams can't afford to\nimport role players from Europe, they pick the stars but will continue to build\ntheir teams around local players.\n\nI'd *LOVE* to see a European NHL division but can't see it happen for some\ntime. There's simply not enough fan interest at the moment in several\n"crucial" markets like Germany, Italy and France while Sweden and Finland\nprobably can't afford to shell out $20-$30 for tickets the way\nAmerican/Canadian fans do. Call it "the Minnesota North Stars" effect:\nScandinavians do love hockey but we prefer to watch local, inexpensive\nhockey to the NHL. The National Hockey League should love the idea, though.\nPan-European TV channels such as Eurosport could bring in the millions the\nAmerican networks likely never will pay.

Right Gerald.  And take away Bob Probert and the Wings are dead Octopuses.\n\n\nLet's wait for the body to get cold before we start in with the eulogies\nhm?  They have only lost ONE game.  The game was in Detroit after all and\nPotvin did not have his best evening.  Nobody that I saw thought that the\nLeafs would sweep the Wings.  It looks like it might go six.  The Leafs\nwill take the Wings home advantage away in the next game.\n\n\n--
Last night during a Sharks' broadcast, Commissioner Bettman was\ninterviewed during the first intermission.  He made no bones about it,\nthe expansion to 28 is on permanent hold until he is satisfied that\nthe current allotment of 26 are fully stable.  This means that cities\nlooking for a club in the foreseeable future will have to wait until\none team in some location fails or looks to relocate.\n\nThis is good, IMO.  There's no sense in expanding if it only means\nmore failing franchises are in the mold.
Just heard on the news that Mike Keenan formerly of the Blackhawks, Flyers,\nand General of a Siberian Prison has just signed to coach the Rangers.  The\nRangers, who won the President's Cup last year have slipped just a bit at the\nend of the season and are destined to finish last behind the lowly Flyers.\nThe Flyers' fans are going to be disappointed on Keenans decision, because\nthey were very interested in him.

Yup. Then again, there are lots of foreign-born players on the Canadian\nnational soccer team so the Brits give something back to you in the end:-)\n---\nFor the record, former NY Rangers coach Ted "Darth" Sator recently led\nLion Milan (Jari Kurri's former team, only the nickname's changed\n[Devils->Lion]) to their second straight Italian championship.

I thought it was 1) wins 2) goals for.
Later on, in your posting, you make reference to "putting words\ninto other people's mouths"...I would suggest that your last\nparagraph can only be interpreted in one way...namely, that I,\nalong with Greg, claim that Gainey never made a technical\nmistake.  If you actually read what I've written, you will find\nthat I make no such claim...soooo, if logic serves me well,\nyou're contradicting yourself.\n \n \n \n \nRoger, I'm not sure here, but I think "ignorance" is really a\nfunction of "a lack of knowledge" and not "formulating an\nopinion"...but hey, if you need to take a cheap shot, then by all\nmeans go ahead...that's if it makes you feel better.\n \n \n \n \nMy word, such vehemence against poor ol' Bob Gainey.  Why does\nhe bother you so much...he was an effective player for his style\nof play.\n \n \n \nI'm really sorry Roger, but you have lost me completely here. \nWhy don't you ask me if I would rather have Jesus Christ,\nhimself, in nets?\n \nNow, if you were to compare, say for example, Bob Gainey with Guy\nCarbonneau, you would have a balanced comparison.\n \n \n \nI'm wrong AGAIN...hmmm, let's see...where was I wrong in the\nfirst place?  I'm only guessing here, Rog, but I have a feeling\nthat you've setup a "You're wrong again" macro key on your\nmachine.\n \nI agree that my use of the word plugger is simplistic...but I\nthink you know what I'm getting at.  I would also like to point\nout that Gilmour's potential as a Selke-winner was never part of\nthe debate...are you asking me for an opinion?  If so, I think\nthere are far too many other deserving players to include Gilmour\namong the candidates.\n \n \nI would suggest that your comment: "And when the press runs out\nof things to say about  the stars on dynasties they start to hype\nthe pluggers.  Grant Fuhr, Essa Tikkannen, Butch Goring, Bob\nNystrom, Bob Gainey, Doug Jarvis, Derek Sanderson, Wayne Cashman,\nBob Baun, Bob Pulford, Ralph Backstrom, Henri Richard, Dick\nDuff...and so on..." demonstrates a blanket disregard for these\nindividuals as contributors to the game...so yes, settle\ndown...nobody has claimed that they are hockey gods.\n \n \n \nC'mon...it has a nice ring to it...and admit it, you had a good\nlaugh.\n \ncongenially, as always,\n \njd\n \n--\nJames David\ndavid@student.business.uwo.ca
Chelios is by far the MVP on Chicago...\n\n\nManson, by his own admission, had a terrible year...the Oilers\ndon't really have a team MVP...by default, it should go to Craig\nMacTavish.  Shjon Podein was the biggest surprise...Tikkanen the\nbiggest disappointment.\n\n\nTinordi was back by mid-season last year...and when he plays he is the MVP.\n\n\nKing had a great year last year also.\n\n\nHow can Kovalev be a surprise?\n\n\nFence-sitting...look at Philly's record with Eric and without...\nthere is no doubt.  Soderstrom is probably the biggest surprise.\n\n\nTocchet had a near 100 point season in Philly with Mike Bullard as\nhis center...why shouldn't he be able to do that with Mario?\n\n\nReally Joseph deserves the MVP nod.
There was apparently a 30 minute special here on the Penguins' \nseason on ABC (WTAE - channel 4), immediately preceding the opening \ngame against the Devils on Sunday.  I only turned it on in time to \nwatch the credits.  If anyone taped it and is willing to let me borrow \nit to dub it, I would appreciate it.  I would be willing to come pick \nit up, and I'll return it the next day and buy you a beer.  Please \nrespond via e-mail.  Thanks a lot.\n	Oh yeah.  Was it any good?\n						-Billy
You're right ... I'm sick of seeing all those white guys on skates\nmyself ... the Vancouver Canucks should be half women, and overall \none-third Oriental.\n\n\n\n(-; (-; (-; (-; (-; (-; \n\nAnd I'll gladly volunteer myself for the overage draft. (-;\n\ngld
Kevin Todd is an Oiler and has been one for months. How closely do you follow\nthe Devils, anyway? Jeez....
;^)
I'm not sure about Juha, but another top center, Rauli Raitanen([ss{t)\nis drafted by Jets. Raitanen had very good year and he has played in the\nFinnish nationalteam. I believe that he'll be one of the best finns in\nthis year's WC, if Matikainen(Head coach) elects him to the team.
I should have guessed. It's time for the annual Pittsburgh Penguins\nwhine-a-thon. Bowman was complaning about cheap shots by the Devils in\nGame 1. I'm sorry, Mr. Bowman, you're a great coach, but those "cheap\nshots" were nothing compared to what's going to come. Also, I guess you\nwere only able to notice the cheap shots made by the guys not in white.\nIt's amazing what those black and gold colored glasses will do. \n\nPS - Nice dive on that high stick Mario. Everyone knew it was a high\nstick, you could have stayed on your feet and saved your diving talent\nfor later.

Is the answer as simple as that you dislike russians???\n\n\n\n\nAnd where would canadian hockey be today without the europeans?? Dont say\nthat the european influence on the league has been all bad for the game.\nI mean, look at the way you play these days. Less fights and more hockey.\nImho, canadian hockey has had a positive curve of development since the\n70's when the game was more brute than beauty......\n\n\nOh, look!! You don't like Finns either....\n\nToo bad almost all of you northamericans originates from europe.....\n\nHmmm... And what kind of a name is Rauser. Doesn't sound very "canadian" to\nme. ;-)
My vote goes to Andy Moog 1st, Belfour 2nd, Vanbiesbrouck 3rd\n\nThe Bruin's are hot at just the right time !!!!!\n\n\nrich beskosty
Hmmm...I also heard through the grapevine that Team Finland might try and\nleave a spot open for at least one NHLer. (Some guy named Sel{nne, ever\nhear of him? :)  They might have to be content with Kurri, though, I hope. :)

To put it mildly.  As I watched the Flyers demolish Toronto last night, 4-0,\nI realized that no matter how good the Leafs' #1 line may be, they'll need\none or two more decent lines to go far in the playoffs.  And, of course, a\nhealthy Felix Potvin.
The r.s.h FAQ sheet never fails to crash my newsreader.  The only way I\ncan avoid crashing (and restarting the machine) is to look at the headers and\navoid reading the FAQ.  Does anyone else have problems reading the FAQ?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOne reason that the WHA abandoned the blue puck was the fact that it\ncrumbled very quickly during play.  The blue dye that was used somehow\naffected the vulcanized rubber of the puck, decreasing its cohesiveness.
Apparently, Part 2 (defensemen numbered 2 through 19) was lost when I posted\nit; to make things worse, I lost my own copy.  I have asked on the Sharks\nmailing list, on which it did get out, to see if someone can mail me a copy\nback.  If someone responds, I will repost it when I get it; otherwise, I will\nre-write it in a day or two and post it.  Sorry about that.\n\n#8	LARRY DEPALMA		Season:	3rd\nAcquired:	'91-92, free agent from Minnesota\nGrade:		I (C-/D+)\n\nNo netter/fan watching the Sharks, including me, knows where DePalma was at\nthe end of the season; the Sharks appeared to still have his rights, but he\nwasn't in San Jose, he wasn't in Kansas City, and his name hasn't appeared on\nthe waiver wire.  And that kind of invisibility was prevalent for the most part\nfor DePalma.  After being called up October 30 against the Tampa Bay Lightning,\nDePalma had an excellent week, scoring 5 points in 3 games while playing good\ndefense.  Unfortunately, the 27-year-old DePalma then disappeared the rest of\nthe way, getting just 3 more points in 15 more games, and generally looked\nlethargic and uninterested on both ends of the ice.  He then was sent down to\nKansas City, walked out from there, and was suspended and later reinstated\nwhen it was revealed that he was injured; he then promptly disappeared from\nthe watching eyes of Shark Bytes (as the mailing list is now known to Sharks\nofficials) faithful, and neither the Sharks nor we miss him.\n\n#10	JOHAN GARPENLOV		Season: 3rd\nAcquired:	'91-92, trade with Detroit for D Bob McGill and 8th round\n		pick in '92 entry draft from Vancouver\nGrade:		A/A-\n\nAfter an early slump, Garpenlov was nothing short of inspirational the rest\nof the way, finishing with 66 points in 79 games, second highest total on the\nteam, as he clicked well with team MVP Kelly Kisio and right wing Rob\nGaudreau.  Kisio got most of the credit, but Garpenlov, finishing second in\nthe MVP voting, clearly demonstrated his playmaking and scoring skills, as he\nwas seen making excellent centering passes as well as finishing passes to him\nby putting the puck past opposing goaltenders, getting a club-high 14 power-\nplay goals.  Contrary to his previous rep, Garpenlov also showed that despite\nhis small size (5' 11", 183 lbs.), he was willing to throw himself around\nwhen necessary, albeit not very successful yet.  He also still needs to work\non his defense, although he improved tremendously throughout the season, and\nwas actually quite a good penalty killer by the end of the season.  He will\nbe a major key to the offense next year.\n\n#15	DAVID BRUCE		Season: 5th\nAcquired:	'91-92, from St. Louis in expansion draft\nGrade:		I (?)\n\nAfter a banner '91-92, when he led the team in power-play goals (10) and\nwas third in total scoring (38 points in 60 games), Bruce was bothered\nvirtually all of this season with a groin injury, which kept him out of the\nlineup for all by 17 games this season.  Of course, it is difficult to\nspeculate how well he would have done this season had he not been affected by\nthe injury, but the 28-year-old Bruce was effective with a man up or a man\nshort in the Sharks' first season, and was expected to be a strong offensive\nleader this season as well.  The injury appears serious, which is a shame,\nbecause otherwise he may have a much brighter future for now; instead, his\nfuture with the Sharks next season appears clouded.\n\n#18	MARK PEDERSON		Season:	3rd\nAcquired:	'92-93, trade with Philadelphia for C/LW Dave Snuggerud\nGrade:		I (B)\n\nIt is difficult for me to understand the Flyers' decision to unload Pederson,\nafter a very good offensive season last season (40 points in 58 games), but\nafter riding the pine early in the season, Pederson was summarily sent to the\nSharks in exchange of the defensive-minded Snuggerud, and he finished with\n41 games combined with the Flyers and the Sharks.  He was also limited by\ninjuries this season, and this limited his production (17 points).  But when\nhealthy, Pederson appears impressive, with a good scoring touch, good size\n(and the willingness to throw it around, although he's not considered a\nphysical forward), and good speed.  He also does not appear to be a liability\non defense, but the Sharks probably have to wait until next season to see how\nmuch, exactly, Pederson can do.\n\n#20	JOHN CARTER		Season: 4th\nAcquired:	'91-92, free agent from Boston\nGrade:		I (B+/B)\n\nCarter was definitely one of the hardest workers on the team, and the hard\nwork worked wonders, as at times he looked great on ice.  However, although he\ndid look great at times, the fact that he received just 16 points (in 55\ngames) for his efforts is a sign that there is only so much his hard work can\ndo, and the Sharks confirmed that by sending him to Kansas City with about\n20 games left in the season.  Carter, who will turn 30 on May 6, always\nhussled, but as a result, was sometimes trapped too deep within the offensive\nzone while forechecking, but he was generally a credit on the defensive end,\nbut he is probably of limited utility in that capacity, and he did not impress\noffensively, although he was one of the best Sharks at drawing penalties.  He\nis very unlikely to be back next season.\n\n#28	JEAN-FRANCOIS QUINTIN	Season: 1st\nAcquired:	'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft\nGrade:		I (B+/B)\n\nI don't understand why the Sharks didn't let Quintin play any more than the\n14 games he played this season.  He was generally hard-working and creating\nopportunities offensively, and appeared, at age 23, ready for regular NHL\nduty, at least for a team like the Sharks, finishing with 7 points in those\n14 games while not being a defensive liability.  Shoulder injury in training\ncamp before the '91-92 season limited Quintin, the team's leading scorer in\nexhibition games despite sitting out the final two, to just 29 games with the\nSharks and the Blades that season, but he looked impressive.  He should be a\nsolid contender for regular duty next season.\n\n#41	MARK BEAUFAIT		Season: 1st\nAcquired:	2nd round pick in 1991 supplemental draft\nGrade:		I (?)\n\nAfter a all-star season at Kansas City, Beaufait got a cup of coffey with the\nSharks late in the season when the Blades knocked down a playoff spot and the\nSharks decimated with injuries, playing 5 games and scoring a goal for his only\nNHL point thus far.  Despite small size (5' 9", 165 lbs.), Beaufait was not shy\nto throw himself around when necessary, and looked pretty good at times,\nalthough it's too early to judge him based on 5 NHL games, in which he played\nmostly left wing, away from his center position at Northern Michigan and\nKansas City.\n\n#42	JAROSLAV OTEVREL	Season: 1st\nAcquired:	8th round pick in 1991 entry draft\nGrade:		I (?)\n\nLike Beaufait, Otevrel also played away from his normal position when he was\nup for his cup of tea (7 games) midway through the season.  He was generally\nvery much of a defensive liability, and did not show much offensively either,\nalthough that may be more indicative of the lack of ice time he got in those\n7 games.  He may need another season to work on his defense, but once his\ndefense is acceptable, he should be ready.\n\n#44	MICHEL PICARD		Season: 1st\nAcquired:	'92-93, trade with Hartford for LW Yvon Corriveau\nGrade:		I (B-/C+)\n\nThe 23-year-old Picard, although he perennially tore up the minors, seems to\nbe close to being out of chances, for some reason, after being acquired by the\nSharks but failing to impress the management in 25 games, scoring 4 goals for\nhis only points, and he spent most of the rest of the way in Kansas City.\nHe was not particularly strong defensively, and despite his offensive\nbrilliance in the minors, he has failed thus far to score in the NHL, although\nhe has been given limited opportunities.  He may be the Sharks' bait in the\nexpansion draft.\n\n#45	DODY WOOD		Season: 1st\nAcquired:	3rd round pick in 1991 entry draft\nGrade:		I (D+/D, although perhaps I shouldn't give a grade at all)\n\nI have been accused of knocking on Wood too much. :-)  Then, it is probably\nno surprise to you that I am thoroughly unimpressed by Wood thus far, although\n13 games is a small example.  He was generally a nonfactor on offense, was\nnot particularly good defensively, and took too many silly penalties, losing\nmany fights in the process and gathering 69 penalty minutes in those 13 games,\nprojecting to to 446(!) in an 84-game season.  He's not ready, and needs at\nleast another season at KC, where he can work on his fighting skills, if\nnothing else.  His relatively small size (5' 11", 181 lbs.) does not give much\npossibility that he can survive, at this stage, as an enforcer.
Agreed here...I'll never forget Dan Kelly calling the play-by-play in the '87\nCanada Cup.  He was masterful!\n\nAnd Danny Gallivan will _never_ be replaced; even now when I watch HNIC I\nremember his voice...when I see an Al MacInnis or Al Iafrate (hey, what's with\nthese guys named Al who can shoot??) shot from the point I still think\n"blistering blast"...THN had a tribute to Gallivan in the issue following his\ndeath; in the story they included a quote from one of the games he did.  It\nwent: \n\n"It appears Risebrough has pugnaciously construed that check," he said, "and \nwill undoubtedly make a visitation to the box of punition."\n\nClassic, vintage Gallivan!  He's sorely missed.  So here's to two of the best\nthere was and best that ever will be.
How long has Don Cherry been a student at SFU? (or is that Arche Bunker?)\n\nPlease, keep this racist drivel off of the net.  You're an embarassment\nto Canadians everywhere.
I'm starting an informal poll on goalie masks. I'd like to know\nwho's mask you think looks the best. I've always like Curtis Joseph's\nof the Blues the best.

Speaking of spelling errors on the Cup, I wonder if the "h" in\nPittsburgh made it to the Cup.  You know how funny people can\nbe about spelling Pittsburgh.
Derian Hatcher's game-misconduct penalty was rescinded by the NHL, \nallowing the Minnesota defenseman to play in the North Stars' last two \nregular-season games.  Hatcher was given the penalty during a fight at \nthe end of a loss at St. Louis on Sunday, April 11.  But the league \ndidn't rescind the game-misconduct penalty Shane Churla received.  The \nStars recalled center Cal McGowan from their top minor league club in \nKalamazoo, Mich., to replace Churla.\n\nThe above is courtesy of The Washington Times on-line service.\n\nNow, here's where I need help.  If anyone out there has a tape of Tuesday's\nChicago-Minnesota game, please contact me.  Terms will be favorable.\n\nAlso, if anyone can tape tonight's Minnesota-Detroit game, please contact\nme.  This could be quite important.  Once again, I will make it worth\nyour trouble.\n\nThanks to all.
Whatta ass!!!!!
So in other words, if Roussel shuts out the Sharks and Soderstrom shuts out\nthe Penguins, that's immaterial because it was the coaches decision? Come on,\nJoe, think about what you're saying! Who they played is VERY significant.\nWhy they played them is what's irrelevent. A low GAA against good teams\nis better than a low GAA against bad teams in the context of comparing two\ngoaltenders. A low GAA is better then a higher GAA. A low GAA against good\nteams is much, much better than a higher GAA against bad teams in the context\nof comparing two goaltenders.\n\n\nYES IT DOES! Absolutely. **In the context of comparing two goaltenders**.\nOf course, at the end of the season 2 points is 2 points no matter how you\nget them. And on the score sheets shutouts are shutouts. But if you're a\ncoach deciding between two goalies, or a GM looking to make a trade, you\nhave got to look deeper than the stat sheets. I didn't see the second Toronto\ngame, but the first one was a defensive masterpiece. There was nothing in\nthat game to judge Tommy Soderstrom on because he wasn't tested. The same\nfor Roussel in the Ranger game. Two real scoring chances, one he made a\ngreat play, the other he was saved by a mistake from the other player. If\nyou were judging Roussel on that game alone, you have very little to go by.\n\nBut if you were to look at the 0-0 tie against the Habs, you saw a goalie\nstand on his head to get that shutout. THAT was a #1 goalie in action. Roussel\ndoesn't have a game like that in him.\n\n\nDon't be so sure of that. FLYERS management never says bad thing about\nRoussel, but they don't say too much on the good side either. I've seen\nat least two interviews where every time Farwell was asked how happy he was\nto have two good goaltenders, it was Tommy this, Tommy that, and oh, yeah,\nDom has played well too.\n\n\nFLYERS in the NHL Hall of Fame. Kinda dull, really. They handed out a\nteam picture to everybody who walked in from Pizza Hut, but it was the\nsame picture they sold in the programs in mid-season. Had names like Benning,\nKasper...\n\n\nMostly random seat locations, some were given out by having certain\nautographs on the team photos. I don't like that method since I've seen\nguards help out people get things like Lindros pictures, surely if they\ngot their hands on an autographed picture they'd hold 'em for their buddies.
Mr. Bettman	The Guy in the Wrong Sport\nMr. Stein	The Guy Who Should Be In Charge But Isn't\n\nOf course, we also need new names for the individual awards, and other\nstuff like the President's Cup.\n\nPresident's Cup		The Trophy Given To the Best Regular-Season Team\nHart winner		The Most Valuable Player, chosen from the\n				Guys in the Middle, the Guys on the\n				Right, the Guys on the Left, the Guys\n				Back There, and the Guy in the Net,\n				though typically given only to the\n				Guys in the Middle and the Guys on \n				the Left and on the Right\nNorris winner		The Best Guy in the back; or, the Guy who was\n				awarded for something even though he\n				is not one of the Guys in the Middle\n				or on the Left or the Right\n\n...ad nauseum.\n\n:-)\n\n--\n    Keith Keller				LET'S GO RANGERS!!!!!\n						LET'S GO QUAKERS!!!!!\n	kkeller@mail.sas.upenn.edu		IVY LEAGUE CHAMPS!!!!
Aargh!\n\nPaul Stewart is the worst and most biased ref. presently in the NHL.\nHe called a total of 4 penalties on the Habs and one on the Nordiques.\nThe Nords' penalty came in O.T.  Stewart, being an ex-Nordique himself,\nwas looking to call penalties on the Habs while letting the Nords\nget away with murder...WE WAS ROBBED!!!!\n\nIt was an excellent game with plenty of end-to-end rushes and tremendous\ngoalkeeping.  The Nords tied it with over 1 minute to go while Lebeau\nwas serving a penalty.  I don't mind Stewart calling a penalty in the\nlast 5 min. of the game, but AT LEAST BE FAIR ABOUT IT.  The Nords were\ncaught with their hand in the cookie jar more than once.  Stewart turned\nthe other cheek...BASTARD!\n\nPatrick Roy collapsed after letting in the tieing goal. He was shaky and\non his knees for the rest of the night.  The winning goal shouldn't have\ngone in.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm not blaming the loss on Stewart.  The Habs had\nplenty of chances to capitalize, Muller, LeClair, Haller, etc. but\nfailed to put the puck in the net.  That's what did them in.  But\nMr. Stewart didn't help matters at all.\n\nOh well, at least the Bruins lost in O.T. also Ha, Ha!!--)\n\n                               ,,,\n                              (0-0)\n============================oOO(_)OOo===================================\nThe Czar of Mainframe Computing <JBE5@MUSICB.MCGILL.CA>\nMcGill University\n\n --> I'M TOO SEXY FOR COBOL.\n\n---> Habs...will beat the Nords in 7!!!!\n\n---> Let's Go Expos!\n             ===========================================\n             | Hickory, dickory doc,                   |\n             | She took a good look at your cock.      |\n             | It's really scary all rinkled and hairy,|\n             | It smells like a 10 year old sock!      |\n             |           --Andrew Dice Clay            |\n             ===========================================
1992-93 Los Angeles Kings notes and game reports.\n-------------------------------------------------\nKings 6 @ Calgary Flames 3 - 04/18/93\n\nThe third place Kings opened the 1993 Stanley Cup Playoffs in Calgary, against\nthe second place Flames and came out with an impressive 6-3 victory in front of\na non-sellout crowd of 18,605 at the Saddledome in Calgary.\n\nSymthe Division playoff hockey this was.  Both teams seemed a bit tense in the\nopening period though the Kings scored off the opening face-off.  The Kings got\ninto the flow of the game much earlier than the Flames as they played out-\nstanding team defense.  It took the Flames 9:45 of the first period to record\ntheir first shot on goal.  The Kings, ranked 16th of the 16 playoff teams on\npenalty killing, shut down the Flames.  The Flames went 0-8 on the power play \nand could record only 8 shot on goal in those 8 opportunities.  The Kings had\ntheir problems on the power play, yet they did manager to score 2 goals in 10\ntries.\n\nThe Kings forwards back-checked while the defense stood the Flames up at the\nblue line, allowing the Kings to take took the home ice advantage away from the \nFlames.  Rob Blake missed the game due to the lower back contusion but is ex-\npected to be in the lineup on Wednesday. Wayne Gretzky suffered a charlie horse\nin his right leg.  He took a few shifts in the second period before retiring to \nthe dressing room for the rest of the game.  Interviewed on the radio this \nmorning, he stated that he was fine and would be in the lineup on Wednesday.\n\n1st period: \n1-0. The Kings got things started right off the opening face-off.  Gretzky won\nthe draw with the puck going to Sydor.  He crossed center ice and slapped the\npuck into the Flames zone and behind the net.  The puck carried around to the\nfar side where Robitaille wacked at it and the rebound bounced to Sandstrom. He\nput the puck behind the Flames net where Gretzky picked it up.  Gretzky set up\nin 'his office', moved to the near side and passed into the near circle where\nSydor had moved in.  Sydor, who got the puck between the face-off dot and the \nhash mark, shot off the pass, beating Vernon low and between the legs.\n\nMillen and Fleury went off at 4:57.  Skrudland went off at 12:25 but the Kings\nfailed to convert.  Carson went off at 14:53 and the Flames failed to convert.\nDahlquist went off at 18:34 and Dahl went off at 19:30, giving the Kings a 30\nsecond 5on3 which they failed to convert.  The Kings recorded 2 goal posts in\nthe period.\n\n2nd period: \nThe Kings opened with a 5on3 carried over from the 1st period which they failed\nto convert on.  With 6 seconds left in the 5on4, Vernon put a bouncing puck into\nthe stands and received a delay of game.\n\n1-1. Calgary evened the score on the ensuing Kings power play.  Kurri, with the\npuck in the neutral zone, tried to put the puck into the Flames zone but it hit \nthe stick of Fleury and bounced to Suter at the Flames blue line.  Suter skated \ndown the near wing and into the Kings zone.  He faked a shot at the circle and\nskated around Kurri. As he cut thorugh the crease, he got Hrudey to go with him \nand he put the puck behind Hrudey, on his stick side for a short hander.\n\n2-1. The Kings reclaimed the lead 25 seconds later on the same power play.\nShuchuk, in the far circle passed to Sydor at the top of the slot and headed\nfor the net.  Sydors shot hit Shuchuk in the back and dropped into the low slot \nwhere 2 Kings (Shuchuk and Granato) were being checked by 3 Flames.  Carson\ncame from the far corner, picked up the loose puck and snapped a wrist shot\nbetween the legs of Vernon from 5 feet above the crease.\n\n3-1. The Kings widened their lead just 24 seconds later.  Rychel was checked off\nthe puck at the Flames blue line.  Taylor picked up the puck and sent a pass\ncross the slot to Huddy.  Huddy shot off the pass, from the near face-off dot,\nbeating a diving Vernon on the glove side.\n\n4-1. 2:59 later, the Kings had a 3 goal lead.  McSorley took a shot form the\nnear point that hit a Flame and deflected towards the boards.  Marty got his\nown rebound, skated to the bottom of the circle and sent a pass into the low\nslot that hit Dahlquist on the leg and deflected past the stick of Vernon.\n\nSkrudland went off at 10:53 but the Kings could not convert.  Sydor went off at\n12:35 and Watters went off at 14:40, giving the Flames a 5 second 5-3 but they\nfailed to convert.  McSorley went off at 17:19 and the Flames had 3 consecutive\npower plays but the Flames killed it themselves when Suter went off for high\nsticking at 17:31.  Sandstrom went off at 18:03 to close out the period.  The\nKings hit 3 goal post in the period.\n\n3rd period:\nThe Kings used the phrase "Initiate, not retaliate" and it was very evident here\nin the 3rd period as the Kings continued to pound the body and the Flames \ncontinued to take bad penalties to take themselves out of the game.\n\n5-1. The Kings extended their lead to 4 goals at the 1:06 mark.  The Kings shot\nthe puck into the near corner of the Flames zone.  Vernon went behind the net to\ncut off the puck but he could not control it.  Donnelly, who was behind him,\nwacked at the puck, sending it into the low slot.  As Vernon slid back in to the\ncrease, Granato got a shot that hit a Flame and bounced to the left of the net\nwhere Millen fired the rebound behind Vernon.\n\nSydor went off at 1:24; Nieuwendyk went off at 3:22 as the teams skated 4 on 4.\n\n5-2. Otto, skating down the far side, stepped around McSorley, cut to the net\nand passed to Dahlquist in the low slot.  Dahlquist cut through the top of the \ncrease and put the puck in under a diving Hrudey.\n\nCarson and Rychel came in on a 2-1.  When Carson passed across to Rychel, Fleury\ntripped Rychel with no call.  The puck got shoveled into the far corner where \nFleury knocked Rychel down and checked him from behind into the boards, drawing \na 5-minute major and a game misconduct at the 6:08 mark.  Unfortunately, the \nKings squandered the 5 minute power play when Granato (at 6:44) and Watters (at \n8:19) took penalties.  \n\n5-3. The Flames closed to within 2 at the 8:47 mark.  MacInnis, at the near \npoint, passed to Yawney at the far point.  He took a few strides towards the\nnet, wound up and drove a shot off the near post and in over the glove of\nHrudey.  The play started on another faceoff that the Kings lost.  Timeout - LA.\n\n6-3. MacInnis took a penalty at 9:56 and the Kings converted on the power play\nto seal the victory.  Sandstrom, skating down the far wing in the Flames zone \ncut towards the back of the net.  Just as he crossed the goal line, he passed \nthe puck into the low slot, on the far side, to Carson who shot off the pass, \nbeating Vernon on the ice, stick side.\n\nAt the 16:17 mark, Skrudland went off for slashing and Stern went crazy as he\nwent after Shuchuk.  Stern wound up with a double minor for roughing, a single\nminor for cross checking and a 10 minute misconduct, and he took the Flames\nright out of the game.\n\nOn the plus side:  The Kings, for the most part, played very disciplined hockey\nas they let Calgary retaliate.  The Kings played good team defense and excellent\npenalty killing.\n\nOn the minus side:  The Kings lost almost every face-off.  This must improve or\nthe Flames will surely get that power play back on track.\n\nNotes:\n------\nThe Kings recalled Guy Leveque, Brandy Semchuk and Jim Thomson from Phoenix.\n\nWayne Gretzkys 1st period assist was his 307th career playoff point.\n\nThe Kings entered the game 24th in the league in shots per game against, giving\nthe opposing team an average of 34.4 shots per game.\n\nFlames goaltender Mike Vernon entered the game with a 3-9-1 record in afternoon \ngames.  The Flames entered the game with a 34% success rate on the power play\nover their last 9 games.\n\nThe teams were 3-3-1 against each other in the regular season.\n\nPlayoffs:\nCampbell Conference:\nSmythe Division:\nLA  6  @ CAL 3 		LA leads 1-0\nWIN    @ VAN\n\nNorris Division:\nSTL 4  @ CHI 3		STL leads 1-0\nTOR    @ DET\n\nWales Conference:\nAdams Division:\nBUF 5  @ BOS 4 (OT)	BUF leads 1-0\nMON 2  @ QUE 3 (OT)	QUE leads 1-0\n\nPatrick Division:\nNJ  3  @ PIT 6		PIT leads 1-0\nNYI 1  @ WAS 3		WAS leads 1-0\n\nRecords:\n--------\nvs	Smythe	 Norris	 Patrck	Adams	Overall\n================================================\nHome:    0- 0-0  0-0-0   0-0-0  0-0-0    0- 0-0 \nRoad:    1- 0-0  0-0-0   0-0-0  0-0-0    1- 0-0\n==============================================================\nTotal:   1- 0-0  0-0-0   0-0-0	0-0-0	 1- 0-0  \n\nBox Score:\n=========================\nCalgary      0 1 2 - 3\nLos Angeles  1 3 2 - 6\n=========================\n\n1st period: \nLA  Sydor 1 (Gretzky, Sandstrom), 0:16\n    LA  Millen - high sticking, 4:57\n    CAL Fleury - high sticking, 4:57\n    CAL Skrudland - interference, 12:25\n    LA  Carson - tripping 14:53\n    CAL Dahlquist - holding stick, 18:34\n    CAL Dahl - roughing 19:30\n\n2nd period: \n    CAL Verson - delay of game (served by Ashton), 1:34\nCAL Suter 1 (Fleury), 2:48 (sh)\nLA  Carson 1 (Shuchuk, Sydor), 3:13 (pp)\nLA  Huddy 1 (Taylor, Rychel), 3:37\nLA  McSorley 1 (unassisted), 6:36\n    CAL Skrudland - elbowing, 10:53\n    LA  Sydor - tripping, 12:35\n    LA  Watters- hooking, 14:40\n    LA  McSorley - holding, 17:19\n    CAL Suter - high sticking, 17:31\n    LA  Sandstrom - hooking, 18:03\n\n3rd period:\nLA  Millen 1 (Granato, Donnelly), 1:06\n    LA Sydor - hooking, 1:24\n    CAL Nieuwendyk - tripping, 3:22\nCAL Dahlquist 1 (Otto), 4:23\n    CAL Fleury - major (boarding), game misconduct, 6:08\n    LA  Granato - tripping, 6:44\n    LA  Watters - interference, 8:19\nCAL Yawney 1 (MacInnis, Reichel), 8:47\n    CAL MacInnis - roughing, 9:56\nLA  Carson 2 (Sandstrom, Robitaille), 10:32 (pp)\n    LA  Hardy - holding, 11:38\n    CAL Skrudland - slashing, 16:17\n    CAL Stern - double roughing, cross-checking, 10 min. misconduct, 16:17\n\nOvertime: none\n\nShots:\n------\nLos Angeles   8  9 14 - 31\nCalgary       5  8 11 - 24\n\nPower play conversions:\n-----------------------\nFor:      2 of 10; for the year:  2 of  10,  20.00%\nAgainst:  0 of  8; for the year:  8 of   8, 100.00%\n\nGoalies:\n--------\nLos Angeles - Hrudey (1-0-0)\nCalgary - Vernon (0-1-0)\n\nAttendance: 18,605\n\nScratches:\n----------\nRob Blake - back contusion\nGuy Leveque - numbers\nLonnie Loach - numbers\nMarc Potvin - numbers\nBrandy Semchuk - numbers\nRobb Stauber - numbers\nBrent Thompson - numbers\nJim Thomson - numbers\n\nLines - Forwards:\n----------------\n*Robitaille - Gretzky - Sandstrom \nDonnelly - Millen - Kurri\nRychel - Conacher - Taylor\nGranato - Carson - Shuchuk\n\nLines - Defense:\n----------------\n*Huddy - Sydor\nWatters - Zhitnik\nHardy - McSorley\n\n* denotes starting lineup\n\nNext game:\n----------\nWednesday, April 21 @ Calgary Flames; 6:30pm Pacific Time on Prime Ticket\n===============================================================================\nStan Willis (willis@empire.dnet.hac.com)\nnet contact: L.A.

After \nthe game, her coach, Gene Ubriaco, said Rheaume performed well enough to \ncompete for the No. 2 goalie spot with the Louisville IceHawks of the East \nCoast Hockey League next season. The Knights and the IceHawks are minor \nleague clubs of the Tampa Bay Lightning.\n**\n  As their first season comes to a close, there are rumors swirling that \nthe Tampa Bay Lightning just might become the Atlanta Lightning.

All series will be best of seven (2-2-1-1-1 rotation) except \nmatchups between Central and Pacific teams.  Those series will rotate 2-3-\n2 to reduce travel.  In those cases, the team with the most regular-season \npoints will choose whether to start the series at home or away.\n\n-----\n\n- Draft news:\n\n        Under terms of the new expansion draft, which will be held in \nJune, each of the 24 existing clubs will be allowed to protect one \ngoaltender, five defensemen and nine forwards. The most recent expansion \ndrafts allowed teams to protect two goalies and did not make a distinction \nbetween forwards and defensemen.\n        First-year pros only will be exempt from the draft, which is down \nfrom the two-year exemption teams had last season. San Jose, Tampa Bay and \nOttawa still will be allowed to exempt second-year pros.\n        Each of the 24 teams will lose two players, with a maximum loss of \none goaltender and a maximum loss of one defenseman. The one exception is \nthat a team which loses a goaltender can then no longer lose a defenseman.\n        At the end of the first phase of the draft, the two new franchises \nwill have three goaltenders, eight defensemen and 13 forwards for a total \nof 24 players. A second phase then will be conducted where San Jose, Tampa \nBay and Ottawa will select two players each from the rosters of the two \nnew teams.\n        Ottawa, Tampa Bay and San Jose will be guaranteed priority \ndrafting selection in the 1993 draft as long as they have the three worst \nrecords. Anaheim and Miami will choose no lower than fourth and fifth. The \nexpansion franchises will move up in the draft should either San Jose, \nTampa Bay or Ottawa not finish in the bottom three positions.\n        The two new teams will pick first and second in the 1994 Entry \nDraft, regardless of their finish in 1993-94. Should either of the two new \nteams not play next season they would have priority drafting position in \n1994.\n\n        The owners announced the 1994 draft will be in Hartford and the \n1995 draft in Winnipeg. The 1994 draft was scheduled for Boston, but a \ndelay in the construction of a new arena required the draft be moved.\n\n-----\n \n- League news:\n\nDisputes:\n\n  The NHL owners and players have resolved differences over salary \narbitration procedures, clearing the way for about 40 hearings.

I re-read what I wrote and it didn't say exactly what I thought.  \n\nSure the Pens are a better team.  They've got size and the best skill players\nin the league.  They've also got the best clutch goaltending.  They're the \nbest team in the league.\n\nBut, my point was the Caps have not played to their ability level vs the\nPens since last year's choke.  And that's the mental problem (the one they've\nhad for a number of years) I tried to point out.  Spirit, mental preparedness,\nwill to win, whatever you want to call it, it's missing when the Caps play the\nPens.  Actually, you're right - it won't make any difference.

3. With Soderstrom and Roussel, why the hell would the Flyers want to\n   pick up an older and slumping Roy?\n\n(BYW, I could come up with a group of players they'd trade for.... but\nthey wouldn't be from the same team.)
I can't believe that the NY Rangers would force its \nplayers to go to Binghamtom to play in the AHL playoffs instead\nof letting them represent their countries in the World Championships.\n\nAnderrson and Zubov are waiting for the NHL to make a decision to this,\nwhile Kovalev has given in and gone down to the minors.\n\nThe Rangers are a disgrace.\n\nps. it has been reported that Neil Smith was very much against\nthe hiring of Mike Keenan. How long will Smith be in NY for?

You think that's bad ... one year, we had all three New York teams in\nthe playoffs and the cableco operator (SCNY once shared a channel with\nBET but someone forgot to throw the switch at 6PM) didn't know what I\nwas talking about ...\n\nWhile it's nice that the NHL is back on American network TV, it faces\nthe same problems as it did with the All Star game.  Local preemptions\nand zero promotion (okay, I don't watch that much TV so I'm just foaming\nall right?).  The league should have made sure that it was solid on cable\nbefore going to the networks.  In year one of the new ESPN contract, the\nsaturation coverage of SCA (all other games shown to completion, like\nthe Quebec-Montreal and Sabres-Bruins overtimes) is missed around here.\n\ngld
According to THE FAN here in T.O., Ottawa has won the Daigle e\nsweepstakes.  They didn't mention why, but San Jose had more goals\nthan the Sen-sens, so I have a hunch this is why Ottawa would pick\nfirst.....
Don't you Americans study history...the French settled in North America\nas early or before the British...Lemieux can probably trace back his\nNorth American heritage back a lot further than most of us.
"Deeply rooted rivalry?" Ahem, Jokerit have been around since 1967 and joined\nthe top flight only in the early '70s. Helsingfors IFK have been around since\n1897 but fans only started taking hockey seriously in the 1960s so I think\nyou're exagerating here.\n\n\nThat's a rather bold claim, in the light of how successful the Canadian &\nAmerican Olympic teams have been . . . and they've had to play according to our\nset of rules and on international ice. The 1992 Olympic teams contained about\nas much talent as your average expansion team. Canada had Eric Lindros, Sean\nBurke, Joe Juneau and Chris Kontos. Another four or five have been deep subs in\nthe NHL. As for the Yanks, Keith Tkachuk, Scott Lachance, Bret Hedican, Shawn \nMcEachern, Steve Heintze, Ted Donato, Joe Sacco and Bill Guerin have been \n3rd/4th line players in the NHL, while Robb Stauber has done well for the \nKings in goal. Nothing more. In fact, I'm sure that an All-Star team assembled\nfrom the best Finnish League teams would do no better in the NHL than Hartford \nor Tampa Bay currently are doing.\n---\nBut what happens if _all_ top-class Finnish & Swedish players gradually end up\nwith Helsinki & Stockholm as the North American-based ones gradually retire and\nno Canadian/American team is allowed to draft new players from Scandinavia? \nHere is what THE HOCKEY NEWS scouts think of our NHL-based players:\n\n(28-30=superstar)\n(23-27=star)\n(18-22=NHL regular+)\n(13-17=NHL regular)\n( 8-12=role player)\n\nFINLAND:  \n\nD-Jyrki Lumme.......20\nD-Teppo Numminen....20\nD-Peter Ahola.......13\n\nC-Jari Kurri........25\nC-Christian Ruuttu..16\n\nR-Teemu Selanne.....27\n\nL-Esa Tikkanen......20\n(Obviously, Selanne's ratings would be higher today than they were in January)\n\nSWEDEN:\nD-Ulf Samuelsson....21\nD-Fredrik Olausson..20\nD-Niklas Lidstrom...18\nD-Calle Johansson...18\nD-Kjell Samuelsson..17\nD-Tommy Sjodin......13\nD-Tommy Albelin......7\n\nC-Mats Sundin.......26\nC-Thomas Steen......18\n\nR-Thomas Sandstrom..22\nR-Ulf Dahlen........18\nR-Michael Nylander..13\n\nL-Per-Erik Eklund...18\nL-Johan Garpenlov...16\nL-Mikael Andersson..15\nL-Jan Erixon........14\n\nThis would be interesting. Clearly, Finland's top five players (Winnipeg's\nSelanne & Numminen, Vancouver's Lumme, Los Angeles' Jari Kurri and New York's\nTikkanen) are right up there with any five-man unit Pittsburgh & co. have. But\nI have my doubts about the home-based Finnish players - the national team did\nwell in the Canada Cup and World Championships largely due to the efforts of\nMarkus Ketterer (the goalie), 3-4 or the players listed above and luck. There's\npresumably a lot of decent players in Finland that wouldn't be superstars at\nthe highest level but still valuable role players, however. My guess would be\nthat the Finnish Canada Cup team would be a .500 team in the NHL.\n---\nSweden is easier to judge because they have more players in North America.\nTheir points total (16 players) is 274 - seven more than Ottawa's 22 top\nplayers combined! If we estimate there are six more NHL regulars back home in \nSweden, an all-Swedish team would assemble about 350-360 skill points.\nDeducting some points from Pittsburgh, NY Rangers and other teams that rely on\nSwedish players, the Swedish team would finish in sixth place - about as high\nas Boston, Vancouver, Calgary and Montreal on paper! So, the "dynasty" talk\nisn't completely unfounded here. An all-Finnish/all-Swedish team might have an\nadvantage because the players would be playing at home half of the time,\nwon't have to adapt to a foreign country and a foreign language, and presumably\nplay the wide-open European variant of hockey rather than have to learn the\nNorth American checking game. However, if free agency becomes a factor the top \nScandinavian players still might end up playing for large-market teams after a \ncouple of years the same way Edmonton's "dynasty" crumbled in the late '80s. \nSome fringe players likely will be drafted by other NHL teams as having an \nexclusive talent pool might be a bit unfair after all. I'd settle for a \ncompromise, prohibit all European teams from signing a North American during \nthe first two rounds but allow them to keep their top two players. After this, \nthe amateur draft should be open to anyone.
day.\n\nPersonality means something to me.  That is exactly why I like Clement\n(and Emrick).  On the other hand, JD is a pompous, bull-headed, arrogant\nknow-it-all.  He's a real turn-off (which is exactly what I do when he's\non).  One complaint I do have about Clement is that he sometimes talks\ntoo much.  If I wanted that I'd listen to Tim McGarver doing a baseball\ngame.
...\n\nPlease.  Have a care with Phil.  We liked him a lot in Pittsburgh.  He\ndidn't score a lot if you look at his stats last year but he worked his\nbutt off.  It was his speed that created opportunities in the offensive\nzone that allowed the Pens to utilize his potential.  I haven't been\npaying attention to him this year so I can't say I know what you're \nobjecting to.  He has been out with injuries though, hasn't he?  And\nif the offense isn't there, there's not much his speed will do for you.\nLike I said, he created opportunities but he didn't score much.  I thought\nthe money offered from the Rangers was a little high, and so did the Pens,\nI guess.\n\nJoseph Stiehm\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n...\n\nPlease.  Have a care with Phil.

Implicitly you are assuming that goals scored against Winnipeg with Selanne\non the ice can be blamed on him...Roger, he is a FORWARD.  Winnipeg has a\nlousy defensive record anyway.  Let's put it another way.  John Cullen's +/-\nis terrible.  What's your excuse for him?  That his powerplay points don't\ncount?  Neither do Selanne's... \n\n\nKnowledgeable hockey observers the world over would agree that\nfeeding Selanne so he can score does contribute in a meaningful way to\nwinning. \n\n\nYou're worried about Teemu when you have Glenn Anderson on your team?\n\n\nWhat he does best is score...so I refer you to my comment above.
The FLYERS blew a 3-0 lead over the Buffalo Sabres in the second period, but\nKevin Dineen's 7th career hat trick powered them to their 7th consecutive win,\n7-4 over the Sabres who have now lost 7 in a row. Alexander Mogilny led the\ncomeback scoring his 75th and 76th goals of the season which tied the game at\n3 in the 2nd period and 4 in the 3rd. Tommy Soderstrom stopped 41 of 45 shots\non goal to improve his own record to 20-17-6 as he was tested by Mogilny and\nLaFontaine all night.\n\nRoster move:\n\nAndre Faust was once again recalled from Hershey, Shawn Cronin was a healthy\nscratch.\n\nLines:\n\nEklund-Lindros-Recchi\nBeranek-Brind'Amour-Dineen\nLomakin-Butsayev-Conroy\nFaust-Acton-Brown\n\nGalley-Bowen\nYushkevich-Hawgood\nCarkner-McGill\n\nTommy Soderstrom\n\nGame Summary:\n\nSay, if anybody from Buffalo is reading this, where did you people get that\nwoman who sang the anthems? We had to turn down the volume!\n\nThe FLYERS defense started out the game showing everybody why the FLYERS have\nbeen shutting teams out lately by holding the Sabres to only 8 shots in the\nfirst period. They then showed everybody why they will be playing golf Sunday\nwhen they gave up 37 shots in the last two periods. Maybe Tommy told them that\nhe was getting bored back there...\n\nMark Recchi opened the scoring so fast that if you blinked you missed it. After\nBuffalo won the faceoff and dumped, Tommy wrapped the puck around the boards\nto Eric 1/2 way up on his left. Eric dropped it to Galley, and he sent it ahead\nto Recchi steaming out of the zone. Mark skated into the center circle, passed\nthe puck to himself through the legs of Richard Smehlik, skated around him and\nin on Fuhr. Smehlik was pulling at him all the way through the zone with his\nstick, Recchi drifted right, drifted back left, and slid the puck back to the\nright past Fuhr for a 1-0 FLYERS lead at 0:18. It was so beautiful Eric and\nGarry should turn down their assists :-).\n\nThe FLYERS kept the pressure on Fuhr for a while after that, but he was strong\nand kept the FLYERS from doing further damage. The game then became a defensive\nstruggle for a while. The Sabres got the first chance on the power play when\nTerry Carkner took a boarding minor at 10:26 for crunching Dale Hawerchuk into\nthe boards in the FLYERS zone. LaFontaine got the only scoring chance, and not\na terribly good one, as the FLYERS smothered the Sabres power play. Mogilny got\na post after it was over. The 25th consecutive penalty kill for the FLYERS.\n\nKeith Carney took a holding penalty at 13:31 for taking down Mark Recchi to\ngive the FLYERS a power play. The best penalty killing team in the league\ndidn't allow the FLYERS a shot on goal, although the FLYERS did create a\ngood scoring chance for Lindros who partially fanned on his shot. Towards\nthe end of the period the play started going end to end, but everybody kept\nmissing the net. Greg Hawgood took an interference penalty at 18:19 to give\nthe Sabres another power play, but they couldn't get anything going and the\nfans expressed their displeasure, particularly when they iced the puck. Shots\nwere 8-6 Buffalo after the FLYERS had led 6-2 at one point.\n\nMike Emrick interviewed FLYERS president Jay Snider between periods. Jay was\ndisappointed to not make the playoffs, but not discouraged. This was considered\na rebuilding year after *The Trade* and he seemed very happy with the way the\nseason went. When asked if he agonized over *The Trade* he said that it was\nRuss Farwell's trade and not his, that it only was an issue for him and Ed\nSnider as far as the money. But yes, there was some agonizing, and they'd do\nit all over again. When asked how the coaching situation would be handled for\nnext year he said that it's Russ' call, and Russ will evaluate things at the\nend of the season. He feels that they're 3 years away from a shot at the Cup.\nHe expects to get into the playoffs next year, have a shot at a division title\nthe following year, and a shot at the finals the year after that. This based\non the current level of play and anticipated improvements over the summer.\n\nHe's very happy with the re-alignment (he called it "outstanding"). Happy with\nthe current expansion, feels that the talent pool is big enough with the unflux\nof Europeans, but feels that they must make sure existing franchises are stable.\nSeemed to like the idea of playing in the Olympics (booo) but said that there\nwas a definite split among owners and that this certainly would only happen in\nfour years if there was a consensus.\n\nThe Sabres gave the FLYERS their second power play of the game when Brad May\ntook a tripping penalty at 0:51 of the second. The FLYERS had a little trouble\ngetting started, but eventually did. Hawgood took a pass as he was moving\nthroug the neutral zone and handed the puck to Eklund just outside the Sabres\nblue line along the right boards. Eklund carried into the zone nad passed\nacross to Dineen who tried a one timer from between the blue line and the\ntop of the left circle. He half fanned on it, and sent the puck trickling\nthrough the slot. Fuhr didn't know where it was, though, and Hawgood won the\nrace to it and flipped it into essentially an open net at 2:15.\n\nThen Mogilny on a breakaway. He slipped through two FLYERS at the blue line\nand went in on Soderstrom. He went with the backhander, but Soderstrom was\nall over it.\n\nThe FLYERS then took some bad discipline type penalties that really hurt them.\nViacheslav Butsayev took a double minor for roughing and high sticking when\nBarnaby got under his skin and drew one minor, then according to Gary Dornhoefer\ntook a dive to get the other (there was no video) at 4:22. The Sabres coudln't\nget started. Ryan McGill poked at the puck just after a Sabre carried into the\nFLYERS zone, and after a bunch of people poked at it Dineen emerged with it and\nheaded the other way. It started out a 1 on 1, but Brind'Amour hustled ahead to\nmake it a 2 on 1 and back off the defenseman. Dineen let it rip from the top\nof the right circle to make it 3-0 FLYERS at 5:40. That was all for Fuhr, John\nMuckler sent in Dominik Hasek to take over.\n\nBut the Sabres still had lots of power play time. Again they took some time to\njust get into the FLYERS zone, and when they finally did the FLYERS were all\nover them. Boos began to ring through the building. But they finally got through\nSoderstrom on an ugly goal. Smehlik took a shot from the top of the zone that\nmissed and kicked out to Hawerchuk in the slot. Hawerchuk tried a backhander as\nhe skated towards the goal line to the right as Galley dove down to block it.\nMistake #1, he should have let Soderstrom handle the backhander and worried\nabout A) the rebound or B) Barnaby who was camped behind the goal line right\nnext to the net. Well, the rebound dropped right next to Soderstrom, and\nmistake #2, Galley just laid there and watched Barnaby get THREE hacks at the\npuck before he finally pushed it through the goalie. He didn't even swing his\nstick out to try and knock the puck away. With the goal, at 7:48, two streaks\nend for the FLYERS. 150:28 of shutout hockey, and 27 straight penalty kills.\n\nLindros put them right back on the power play at 8:36 with a high sticking\nminor, I think it was Barnaby again. This time the Sabres were able to get\nset up quickly, but couldn't get too much quality on goal. The Sabres continued\nto keep the puck in the FLYERS end for a while after the power play ended.\nThings evetually settled down, but then the other very bad penalty. McGill\nallowed Barnaby to get under his skin and slashed his stick just before a\nfaceoff. The gloves were dropped, and McGill started pounding the crap out of\nhim. But during the fight, he gave Barnaby a head butt with his helmet, and\nthat meant a match penalty. 2 for slashing, 5 fighting and 5 for the major,\n7 minutes of power play time for the Sabres at 14:15, Barnaby only got 5.\n\nThe FLYERS were keeping them at bay for a while, but there was only so long\nthey could do that. After a couple of good Sabre chances, Audette handed to\nLedyard at the point, and Ledyard sent a drive that was knocked down by\nSoderstrom. LaFontaine whacked at the bouncing puck from the left side of\nthe net, and knocked it over to Randy Wood at the right. Soderstrom had\nmoved over to play LaFontaine, and since Yushkevich and Carkner were waving\nat the puck instead of picking up men, Wood just slid it into the empty net\nat 17:34 to close the FLYERS lead to 3-2. LaFontaine was actually trying to\nput it on net, but half fanned on it and got a break.\n\nThe FLYERS then got some shorthanded pressure in the Sabres zone, but Hasek\nwas strong. Finally it was Keith Carney passing ahead to Hawerchuk into the\nneutral zone, and Hawerchuk sent a good backhand pass to Mogilny at the FLYERS\nblue line. Another mini-breakaway for Mogilny, he elected to shoot from the\nleft circle, and he threaded the needle to get it just inside the far post at\n18:56 for his 75th of the season. Ironically, the youth hockey tip between\nthe 1st and second period was Tommy Soderstrom talking about cutting off\nangles...\n\nThat was all in the 2nd, shots were 19-7 Sabres.\n\nInto the 3rd period, and Pelle EKlund blew a golden opportunity to get the\nFLYERS the lead back. A 2 on 1, Acton with the puck, he dropped to Eklund in\nthe slot, and Eklund held the puck as he slid through the left circle until\nhe had almost no angle at all to shoot from. When he finally did shoot, he\nhit the far post. That was still during the carryover power play time.\n\nThan an incredible almost goal. Randy Wood skated around Recchi and Hawgood\nuntouched into Soderstrom. Soderstrom goes down, Wood pokes the puck under\nSoderstrom, and a black object hits the back of the net. Red light comes on,\nhorn sounds, crowd cheers. But up to the video replay booth, for some strange\nreason, and in the meantime Emrick and Dornhoefer try to figure out what they\ncould be reviewing. Well, it turns out that it was the taped up stick blade\nthat went into the net, not the puck. Emrick mentions that one of the criteria\nfor scoring a goal is that the puck must go into the net...\n\nDave Hannan then took out Recchi and got a holding minor at 2:35. The FLYERS\ncould not get anything going at all. They finally got set up 1/2 way through,\nbut were kept on the perimeter. As time ran out, Beranek stripped the puck\nfrom a Sabre in the offensive zone along the right boards and passed it across\nto Eklund at the top of the left circle. Eklund saw Dineen heading at the net\njust inside the right circle and passed through to him. Dineen fumbled the pass,\nbut twice directed it at Hasek, and Eklund swooped in and chipped the bouncing\npuck over the goalie for his 11th at 4:42. 4-3 FLYERS.\n\nBut the Sabres came right back. LaFontaine picked up the puck in his offensive\nleft corner and slid it to Bob Erry behind the FLYERS net. Erry started to skate\nout, but then just dropped the puck back to nobody behind the net. Mogilny flew\nin, skated around, and stuffed it through Soderstrom's 5 hole for his 76th at\n5:24 to tie the game at 4.\n\nThen Hawerchuk took a retaliatory roughing penalty at 5:55. The FLYERS set up\nin the Sabres zone, and stayed there. Off a faceoff high in the Sabres zone in\nthe middle. While Brind'Amour wrestled for the puck, Dineen snuck through the\nline and wristed a perfect shot low to Hasek's glove side at 6:44.\n\nPlay started to go back and forth until Hawgood took a roughing penalty at 8:19.\nThe FLYERS dumped the puck into the Sabres zone. Brind'Amour and Ledyard went\nafter it, and Rod got the puck. He backed away from the right boards, skated\nto the right faceoff dot, and passed between his legs to Dineen crashing\nthrough the slot all by himself. Dineen waited patiently and lifted it over\nthe blocker of Hasek for a 6-4 FLYERS lead at 8:39. 3rd hat trick of the season\nfor Dineen, 7th of his career, 2nd shorthanded goal of the game for him 35th\nof the season.\n\nThen Carney took a tripping penalty at 9:02 to kill the rest of the Sabres\npower play. Not much action on the 4 on 4, and the Sabres got most of the\nchances on the FLYERS resulting power play.\n\nPlay went end to end for quite a while after that and both goalies had to\nmake some big saves. The Sabres weren't able to pull Hasek as time was running \nout as the FLYERS wouldn't allow any consistant possession for the Sabres.\nFinally as time was running out Ken Sutton misplayed the puck in his own left\ncorner and Brind'Amour stripped it away from him. He pulled away and found\nDineen on the other side of the left circle, and Dineen found Acton at the\nright of Hasek. He slid the puck between two Sabres defenders, and Acton\nchipped it back to the far side of Hasek for his 8th of the season at 19:48\non his 35th birthday. That was all the scoring, shots were 18-13 Buffalo,\nand the ice was showered with plastic drinking mugs handed out before the\ngame.\n\nSo another strong game from Tommy Soderstrom who hadn't been tested much\nin his last couple of starts. Kevin Dineen has a career high 6 point night\n(unless he had a better night earlier in the season, but I don't think so).\nThe FLYERS longest winning streak in 3 years, 30 goals for only 11 against\nwith three shutouts. Eric Lindros is 8th in league with 33 even strength goals\ndespite missing 23 games with injury. 4 points out of 4th, clinched 5th place\nsince the Rangers lose the tie breaker.\n\nA couple misc notes:\n\nForget the Mike Keenan rumors, there will be a press conference tommorrow to\nannounce that he will be head coach of the New York Rangers next year.\n\nIn the last notes I mentioned that Garry Galley won the Barry Ashbee Award,\nbut I failed to mention that the award is for the best defenseman.\n\nThe Times of Trenton has reported that "a preeminent specialist from Oklahoma"\nhas looked over Tommy Soderstrom's medical record and determined that no\nfurther tests are necessary in the near future.\n\nSame paper had a blurb about Bill Dineen being asked about whether or not he\nexpected to be back next year. His response was that he wants to come back,\nhe feels he did a good job this year, but that he would cheerfully accept a\nrole scouting if Farwell didn't want him back.\n\nFLYERS team record watch:\n\nEric Lindros:\n\n41 goals, 33 assists, 74 points\n\n(rookie records)\nclub record goals:			club record points:\nEric Lindros	40 1992-93		Dave Poulin	76 1983-84\nBrian Propp	34 1979-80		Brian Propp	75 1979-80\nRon Flockhart	33 1981-82		Eric Lindros	74 1992-93\nDave Poulin	31 1983-84		Ron Flockhart	72 1981-82\nBill Barber	30 1972-73		Pelle Eklund	66 1985-86\n\nMark Recchi:\n\n52 goals, 69 assists, 121 points.\n\nclub record goals:			club record points:\nReggie Leach	61 1975-76		Mark Recchi	121 1992-93*\nTim Kerr	58 1985-86,86-87	Bobby Clarke	119 1975-76\nTim Kerr	54 1983-84,84-85	Bobby Clarke	116 1974-75\nMark Recchi	52 1992-93		Bill Barber	112 1975-76\nRick Macliesh	50 1972-73		Bobby Clarke	104 1972-73\nBill Barber	50 1975-76		Rick Macliesh	100 1972-73\nReggie Leach	50 1979-80\n\n*More than 80 games.\n\nFLYERS career years:\n\nPlayer		Points	Best Prior Season\nMark Recchi	121	113 (90-91 Penguins)\nRod Brind'Amour	84	77 (91-92 FLYERS)\nGarry Galley	62	38 (84-85 Kings)\nBrent Fedyk	59	35 (90-91 Red Wings)\n\nThat's all for now...

This brings up a question I asked myself (no answer) when it was mentionned\nthat the NHL could expand in Europe.\n\nWould most of the North-americans now playing in the NHL be willing\nto play for a team in Europe?\n\nI do not think that the majority of hockey players are necessarily\ninterested in expanding their cultural experience to that level.\n(I know I would but I am not a pro hockey player)\n\nWhen one recalls some players remarks in the last few years it makes\nme wonder how a European expansion could be achieved.  Remember these:\n\n- Lindros did not want to play in Quebec (for more than $ reasons)\n- Nicholls ... in Edmonton.\n- R. Courtnall wanted to be traded to LA only.\n- C. Lemieux said he would refuse to go to Edmonton earlier this year.\n\nI know there are many non-cultural reasons behind these but there is more:\n\n- Some american players who played for the Expos complained about the french\n  fact and that the city was not quite like the other US cities.  One\n  players' wife trying to make her point went on to complain that she could\n  not even find her favorite brand of nacho chips in Montreal.\n\nAnybody knows what happened when all these US football players moved\nto London, Spain, etc .. for the one year of that new football league\n(2 years ago?)\n\nI wonder what the players association thinks about going to Europe.\n\nMyself I would like to see some European teams, but what would be \nthe best way to do it?
Could someone post the Flyers record with and without Eric Lindros in\nthe lineup\n\n\nI have a guy that is trying to compare the Quebec/Flyers trade to the \n\nDallas/Minnesota trade in the NFL(Hershel Walker)\n\nI just need the stat to back up my point that Eric will be one of the next\n\ngreat players\n\nthanks
According to this morning's Post-Gazette:\n\nThe Pens will be carried by KDKA-Radio(1020 am), unless the Pirates\nare playing.  When the Pirates play, the games will be carried by \nWDVE(102.5 fm).  WDVE will carry 12 games, starting with tonight's\ngame.\n\nIn fact, after this season, KDKA will no longer be the flagship\nstation for the Pens.  The Penguins and KBL have struck a new \ndeal regarding the TV and radio rights to the games.  It seems\nmore than likely that WDVE will be the flagship radio station next \nseason.  KBL will carry 62 games on tv,  with 17 of the games to be \nsimulcast on KDKA-TV.  The remaining 22 games, as well as some of the \nearly round playoff games, will be available by "subscription tv" only.\nTo receive the games, you'll have to pay a one time hook up fee, and\nthen a monthly fee of $11-12 dollars.\n\nAlso, under the new deal, there will no longer be radio/tv \nsimulcasts.  There will be a TV broadcast team, and a radio\nbroadcast team.  \n\nNo word on who the announcers will be.  Mike Lange and Paul Steigerwald\nare both under contract with KDKA, but their contracts expire at the\nend of this season.  KBL President Bill Craig said he'd like to hire\nLange and Steigerwald.
It seemed pretty conclusive to me.  The puck clearly hit the crossbar\nand then came down on the line.  And the announcers, admittedly homers,\nkept harping about how they "must have had a different view upstairs"\nbecause it was obvious to them, and, I would have thought, to anyone who\nsaw the replay, that the puck didn't go in.  The referee originally \nsignalled no goal but the video replay "judges" initiated contact with\nthe referee to claim that a goal was in fact scored.  This, to me, is\nunheard of.  Seeing stuff like this happen gives me a bad feeling about\nthe Leaf chances this year.\n\ncordially, as always,\n\nrm
We're probably stuck, as Mike Burger pointed out that the baseball\ndeal was made far in advance of the NHL contract.  WABC did the same\nthing; they were thankful that the Devils were wiped out by 9:30,\nbecause they had to switch over to Yankees baseball.  The proof of \nthe reasons for this is left to the reader ...\n\nIt's too bad, but I wonder if ESPN is stuck with other US local team\ncoverage for their alternate games?  We got NESN's coverage of the\nBruins-Sabres with the Boston homers ... they were awful!!!  I've read\nthat Derek Sanderson is the colour analyst ... I wonder if he spent\nhis early years after hockey as an intern at PRAVDA before landing\nthis job?  *Everything* had to be twisted into something good to say\nabout the Bruin(s) involved ... not even Bill Wirtz's shills on SC\nChicago (Pat Foley, Dale Tallon) were this bad.  And just to be fair,\nSC used to take their feed from ESN (Empire Sports Network), the Sabre\nhomers and they were horrible too ... but they were spacy.\n\nFrom the CNN highlights, I hear Chris Cuthbert's voice from the CBC\ncoverage of the Habs-Nords series.  Too bad that we couldn't get it\non ESPN, with all due respect to the Sabres and the Bruins.\n\nMike Emrick is substituting on the Devils SCNY team for Gary Thorne.\nMike was the original Devils TV play-by-play announcer, by the way.\n\ngld
Wrong information. They just announced that Suhonen has made a deal with \nJokerit.
Funny you should mention this; one time on HNIC Don Cherry pointed out\nVanbiesbrouck's mask.  He _hated_ it.  I think he said something to the effect\nof:\n"You see?  He was great last year; now he goes out and gets that dopey mask \nand he can't stop a beachball!"\n\nYou may or may not take Cherry seriously at all, but I cracked up when I heard\nit.
: You should be ashamed to call yourself an Ulf Samuelson fan. Anybody who plays\n: the way he does, does not belong in the NHL. There have been cheap shot artists\n: through the history of the game, but a lot of them have been talanted players.\n: Bobby Clarke, Kenny Linsemen, Pie McKenzie, Chris Chelios etc.. but nobody has been\n: out right as dirty a cheapshot coward as Ulf. Violence in hockey has got to be curbed\n: and players like (Should have been a Women) Samuelson don't belong. When players\n: like Ulf, who's main purpose is to injure the better players in the league is allowed\n: to continue, and the league won't stop it, the players should. A Christian Pro 1000\n: aluminum stick directed at his ugly head should do the trick nicely. If the Bruins get\n: a chance to meet Pittsburgh in the near future, you can bet Neely will have his day.\n: The sight of watching Ulf turtle up like the coward he is, is worth almost as much as a\n: Stanely Cup. This wimp of a player almost ruined the career of one the best right wingers\n: in the game. If you are to remove Ulf Samuelson from the lineup, the Penguins would not\n: even notice he's gone. He's an eyesore on the game of hockey.\n\n\n: Rich\n\n\nThank you for your extremely lucid and well thought out observation.\nNow when you get back on your medication, please let us know how you\nare feeling. \nThank you,
(Detroit, April 19)\n\nIn a development that shocked most knowledgable observers, the Detroit Redwings\nscored no less than six goals against the best goaltender in the world en\nroute to a 6-3 win over the best team in the NHL, the Toronto Maple Leafs. \n\nThe Leafs could not be faulted, as they completely dominated the inferior\nDetroit squad and clearly deserved to win. Only the biased officiating of\nAndy Van Hellemond and the idiots that insisted upon throwing an octopus on\nthe ice at every stoppage in an obvious attempt to distract the superior \nvisiting side prevented an all-out massacre of the Wings by the league's best \nteam. \n\n       							    Alan

Messier was not invited due to his nagging injuries.  While the press\nmade an issue of it, and attempted to link it to the Rangers' internal\npolitical woes, Mike Keenan repeated that to Messier personally during\nthe MSG press conference.  It makes sense ... Messier would probably\nhave not declined the invitation if it were made for publicity ...\n\ngld
if\nteam! \nYeah but Soderstrom's mask has always appeared to be a lot bigger than the  \naverage helmet-and-cage variety.  It has a certain appeal on its own\n\njosh

Ditto...\n\nIf we allow people like him to continue to do what he does, it's a\nshame.  People say that cheap shots and drawing penalties by fake-\ning is part of the game, I say "Bullsh-t!".  If he ever tried some\nlike that on a Yzerman, he'd would have to deal with Probert now\nwouldn't he?  What Ulf does isn't even retaliatory!  There's now\nway one could justify what he does and if they do they're fools.
No.\n\nIn what still, IMHO, ranks as the all-time greatest PR blunder (not to\nmention on-ice blunder) the Whalers ever committed, GM Eddie Johnston and\nCoach Rick Ley 'decided' that Francis was incapable as a leader and stripped\nhim of the Captain's "C" in December of 1990. The whole organization (read:\nEJ and Ley, and by default owner Richard Gordon because he was too much of\na dupe to know how much he was being blind-sided by EJ) dumped on Francis all\nseason, starting with refusing to sign him to a new contract, publicly \nhumiliating him, stripping him of the "C", and then trading him that Spring\nto the Penguins. Classy guy, that EJ.\n\nThe loss of Francis (and too a lesser extent, Ulf), was one of a series of\ndecimating player moves by EJ which stripped the personality and fan-awareness\nfrom the team that has put them in the precarious position they are in today.\n\n[Gratuitous good EJ note...he did preside over the organization when it\nacquired Verbeek, Cassels, Sanderson, Poulin, Nylander, etc. He stripped the\nroster but he DID lay a foundation.]
Gretzky averaged 2.69 pts/game\n\n\nCheck your information before posting, Gretzky's record is 215 pts in 80 games.\n\n\nOver 84 games, Gretzky's total projected 226 points.\n\n\nThe 76-77 Canadiens had .825 percentage, 132 pts in 80 games. (60-8-12).\nThe 29-30 Bruins had a .875 winning percentage.\nAlso the 77-78 Canadiens had a .806 percentage with a 59-10-11 record.
It was good to see the Wings play, but lets not give ESPN too much credit.\nThere weren't any other late baseball games on so they didn't have another\noption.
I don't know the exact coverage in the states.  In Canada it is covered\nby TSN, so maybe ESPN will grab their coverage!  I don't know!\n\nAs for the picks\nOttawa picks #1 which means it is almost 100% that Alexander Daigle will \ngo #1. He'll either stay or be traded in Montreal or Quebec.  IMO I would\ntake Kariya.  He should alot of leadership in the NCAA and so far in\nthe World Championships.  Daigle didn't show this for his junior team.\n\nSan Jose will then get Kariya.\n\nTampa Bay will either go for a russian Kozlov (I think that's it) or a \n    defenseman Rob Niedemeyer (probably spelt the last name wrong)\n\nBecause of expansion I won't go further but I will name other of the\nblue chip prospects\n\n   - Chris Gratton\n   - Chris Pridham\n   - a swedish player who I can't remember his name\n\nDraft Order\n-----------\n1) Ottawa\n2) San Jose\n3) Tampa Bay\n4) South Florida or Anahiem\n5) South Florida or Anahiem\n6) Hartford\n7) Edmonton\n8) Dallas\n9) NY Rangers\n10) Philadelphia\n\nthe 8th thru 10th picks could be wrong - I don't have the standings here\nand am guessing \n\n(In my mind there are 8 top notch prospects in the draft, with Kariya \n leading the way but not going #1)

You obviously don't understand how TV scheduling works.  ESPN had\nprior contracts to baseball to show Monday night games and had\ncontracted all the other bs shows well in advance.  The NHL TV deal\nwas very late in the scheduling process (you normally have to do this\none-plus year out.  The NHL package was finished two weeks before the\nseason started).  ESPN has shown tremendous commitment to the NHL by\nsqueezing in extra telecasts when it could (like the last Minnesota\ngame) and putting Stanley Cup games as backup to their baseball\ntelecasts (which by favorable circumstances they could pull off last\nnight).\n\nBut the bottom line is that ESPN cannot break contracts at will.  They\nmust honor the previous deals they made.  $$$$ _does_ have something\nto do with it, especially if you risk a $$$$$$$$ lawsuit for breach of\ncontract with baseball.\n\nSo relax.  I'm happy.  (I don't get SportsChannel anyway).
Did they move Probert back to defense?  Why did I see him parking his ass\nin front of Potvin all night?  Somebody is going to have to discipline\nProbert if the Leafs want to win the series.  Perhaps a fresh Clark should\nhit the ice at the end of a long Probert shift and straigten him out for\na while...\n\n\n--
Here in Nanaimo (on Vancouver Island, for you furriners out there) we\ngot the ABC coverage on KOMO.  It probably depends on your cable company.\n\nI started off switching between the CBC and ABC broadcasts, but finally\nsettled on ABC.  I can't stand Don Whitman, and Al Michaels was doing a\ndecent job.  He followed the play pretty well, knew all the players'\nnames, and only made a couple of "rookie" mistakes that I noticed.\nOne thing that surprised me is that they never once attempted to explain\nthe offside rule.\n\nAm-I-paranoid-or-is-this-really-happening department:\nThere were no fights in the game, but there were a couple of occasions\nwhere it looked like a fight was about to start.  Both times ABC cut\naway to show a closeup of a coach or McNall or something.  Has ABC\ndecided to adopt the "Spicer policy?"
Ten years ago, the number of Europeans in the NHL was roughly a quarter\nof what it is now. Going into the 1992/93 season, the numbers of Euros on\nNHL teams have escalated to the following stats:\n\nCanadians: 400\nAmericans: 100\nEuropeans: 100\n\n   Please note that these numbers are rounded off, and taken from the top\n25 players on each of the 24 teams. My source is the Vancouver Sun.\n\n   Here's the point: there are far too many Europeans in the NHL. I am sick\nof watching a game between an American and a Canadian team (let's say, the\nRed Wings and the Canucks) and seeing names like "Bure" "Konstantinov" and\n"Borshevshky". Is this North America or isn't it? Toronto, Detriot, Quebec,\nand Edmonton are particularly annoying, but the numbers of Euros on other\nteams is getting worse as well. \n\n    I live in Vancouver and if I hear one more word about "Pavel Bure, the\nRussian Rocket" I will completely throw up. As it is now, every time I see\nthe Canucks play I keep hoping someone will cross-check Bure into the plexiglassso hard they have to carry him out on a stretcher. (By the way, I'm not a\nCanucks fan to begin with ;-). \n\n    Okay, the stretcher remark was a little carried away. But the point is that\nI resent NHL owners drafting all these Europeans INSTEAD of Canadians (and\nsome Americans). It denies young Canadians the opportunity to play in THEIR\nNORTH AMERICAN LEAGUE and instead gives it to Europeans, who aren't even\nbetter hockey players. It's all hype. This "European mystique" is sickening,\nbut until NHL owners get over it, Canadian and American players will continue\nto have to fight harder to get drafted into their own league.\n\n    With the numbers of Euros in the NHL escalating, the problem is clearly\nonly getting worse.\n\n    I'm all for the creation of a European Hockey League, and let the Bures\nand Selannes of the world play on their own continent.\n\n    I just don't want them on mine.\n\n\n \n \n-- \nRichard J.

[Much text deleted]\n\n:   plus/minus ... it is the most misleading hockey stat available.\n\nNot necessarily the most misleading, but you are right, it definitely\nneeds to be taken in the proper perspective. A shining example is\nif you look at the Penguins individual +/-, you will find very few minuses.\nThat only makes common sense, since they didn't lose many games.\n\n:   Until the NHL publishes a more useful quantifiable statistic including ice\n:   time per game and some measure of its "quality" (i.e., is the player put out\n:   in key situations like protecting a lead late in the game; is he matched up\n:   against the other team's top one or two lines; short-handed, etc), I would\n:   much rather see the +/- disappear altogether instead of having its dubious\n:   merits trumpeted by those with little understanding of its implications.\n\nUnfortunately, you will need to keep a ridiculous number of stats to\nreally come up with a statistic which really shows a player's value.\nLet's just enjoy the game and not overanalyze it. (like I'm doing now,\nexcuse me!)
UPI Clarinet has just relayed a "scoop" from the Toronto Sun\n(or was that Star?  I like the Star myself ...) that Iron Mike\nKeenan has come to an agreement with the New York Rangers for\nnext season.  Interestingly, this comes the day after the Times\nSports had an editorial about how the Rangers need their own\nPat Riley ... who cares about what happens after next season?\n\ngld
Saku isn't that small any longer I guess I heard he is 177cm tall at the\nmoment and will still grow 6-8cm.
I heard it will be the Minnesota-Detroit game. Don't know the time\nthough.\n\nDave
Yeah, but first they have to deal with the Devils,\nwho've had their number all year. I'm not saying\nthe Caps aren't a good team (they've been a thorn\non the Habs side for the past 10 years!!!), just\nthat they won't get past NJ...
Doesn't it also have the Statue of Liberty on it or is that Richter's Mask?\n\nThe back actually has a Bee followed by a Z to represent the Beezer. It \nalso has something that looks like the three interconnecting circles from\nthe Led Zepplin 4 album cover. Is that what it is supposed to be? and if\nit is does anybody know why he would put it there? Ali?\n\n\nJohn\n"The official Language of Golf is Profanity"
It would seem logical that the mask is Potvins. His nickname is "The Cat", \nwhich would go a long ways towards explaining the panther. \n\nOf course, it could be an old story and the mask is Fuhrs, too.....
Well I just read in the Boston Globe that while not confirming\n(or denying) anything, Walsh may end up with the Rangers organizations\nas an (assistant Coach?).  Keenan has talked with Walsh in the past\n(he came up to see Kariya as he will be coaching him in the worlds,\nfunny I guess he got to watch the Ferraro brothers as well.....) I'm\nnot sure if walsh will go, but if Keenan is getting 700,000 and walsh\neven gets 100,000 that's a 30% pay raise for walsh (not to mention\na nice career move....)

NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!  Who's the mindscheme(?) behind this one -- Ted\nSimmons?  As the saying goes, "If it ain't broke, don't fix it."  I'm 230\nmiles from home (during the school year) and will never be able to pick up\nDVE.  At least now I can sort of make out what Mike and Steigy say through\nall the static on KDKA.  This just may be enough reason for me to transfer\nto Duquesne and live at home.  Who's going to announce on DVE anyway? \nPaulson and Krenn?  (Just kidding.)

I was at a Cincinnati Cyclones game a year ago when the local country\nstation sponsored a kazoo giveaway.

Jagr has a higher +/-, but Francis has had more points.  And take it from\nan informed observer, Ronnie Francis has had a *much* better season than\nJaromir Jagr.  This is not to take anything away from Jaro, who had a \ndecent year (although it didn't live up to the expectations of some).\n \n\nDean\n--
I've never seen a game where one player has committed 5\npenalties.  Something like this would require more attention by\nthe referee.\n\n\nBut you're creating a scoring opportunity where there might not\nhave been one before.  I can see the relationship between free\nthrows awarded after a certain number of fouls, but it's\nobviously easier to score in basketball, there are more\nopportunities.  If a basketball team scores 100 points, that's\nat least fifty chances made.  The average number of shots taken\nby each team in a hockey game (and this is a total guess) is\nprobably around 40, and a team is lucky to capitalize on maybe\n5 of them.  You have some good ideas concerning the other\npenalties, but I think that a player should be awarded a\npenalty shot only when they had a chance to score and was\ninterfered with.\n\nAlso, later in the post, you talked about how boring the NBA\ngame you attended was, that play was stopped too often.\nWouldn't your penalty shot rule take up more time during a\nhockey game?
I was playing this golf game and something interesting happened.\nOn the 7th hole, I drove the ball down the fairway, when the ball was\nin mid-flight, the game completely froze. A couple seconds later, the\nscreen went completely black, with an error message in large "Bubble"\nletters that said DIVISION BY ZERO. I thought it was funny considering\nI am a computer programmer, and I had never seen an error like this on\nan actual video game system like Sega or Nintendo (or even Atari or\nIntellevision years ago). Oh yeah, after the message, there was also\nwhat must have been an address, in hexadecimal. I forget the exact hex\ncode that was given. HAS THIS HAPPENED TO ANYONE ELSE??? It must have,\nmy game shouldn't have been the only one to do this.
I think the three-headed GM's guiding principle was to keep veterans\nin favor of youngsters only if they offered a "significant" advantage.\nAt the end of last season, the contracts of several veterans with somewhat\nmaginal contributions (Fenton, Bozek, Anderson, and a couple others I\ncan't remember) were bought out. The idea was that youngsters could\nplay almost as well, and had the potential to improve where these\nolder guys did not. \nAnd they traded Mullen, because he wanted to go, not because he\nwasn't good enough, but I think they were a bit too optimistic\nin thinking they could make up for his contributions.\nAn example from this season, Skriko was brought in on a trial basis\nbut not kept, because of his age. I thought he was a decent\ncontributor worth keeping around.\n\nThe youth movement has its advantages; look at Gaudreau who\nmight still be in KC if more veterans had been kept around. But\nyou have to find the right balance.
In case anyone missed it, I'm reposting this and I'm also selling some other\nstuff.\n\n\n\n\nI've sold one, but I still have 2 left for sale. I also realize that $45 is\nalot of money, especially if you don't normally collect cards. So if enough\npeople are interested, I'll break up the set into team sets. I'm not sure\nhow much for each. It would be nice to just sell them for $3 each, but then\nthe people who get the Whalers and Devils (Note, I'm not bagging on these teams\nits just that they don't have alot of good rookie cards in this set) would\nbe subsidizing the people who want Chicago or Pittsburgh. So I'll have to make\nit varialble pricing. But most of them should be about $2 or $3 dollars.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOk someone asked for this one, but he's from Canada, if he can get me the\nbe the alternate.\n\nAlso I would like to sell 2 Upperdeck Pavel Bure rookie cards (note these\nare not in the UD low #'s set mentioned above). $16 each. They are $15 in\nthe book, but the $1 goes for postage, packaging and insurance.\n\nAnd if there is something you want that you don't see, e-mail me, I may have\nit or may be able to get  it for you.
I'm the keeper of the stats for a family hockey pool and I'm looking\nfor daily/weekly email servers for playoff stats.  I've connected with\nthe servers at J.Militzok@skidmore.EDU and wilson@cs.ucf.edu.  I'm\nstill sorting these two out.\n\nAre there others?  Email please as my site doesn't get this group.\n\nThanks.\n\nRick
Press conference at 1PM ...\n\n\nInterestingly, Keenan's co-coach (or is it his "Number One"?) on Team\nCanada at the World Championships is Roger Neilsen.  \n\nIt'd be interesting if the Rangers call in the balance of Neilsen's\ncontract to be Keenan's assistant ...  Roger did do a very good job\nwith the mediocre players, just as he handled the Cinderella Canucks\nof 10 years ago ... but his mistake was playing the Rangers like those\nCanucks last May ...\n\ngld
Interesting! One of our German friends here (Robert?) told me their forwards\nwere all Canadian-Germans. Perhaps somebody can sort this out for us?\n \n\nOK, "this ain't North America" and so on, but I still doubt that _any_ city\nhaving a pop. of 500,000 and below could support an NHL team. Of course,\nSwitzerland probably should be judged as one large city because of small\ndistances between cities but still. \n\n\nDusseldorf? YES, although the arena is an anachronism (an OPEN wall behind one\nof the goals - essentially an outdoor arena!). Cologne's arena only seats about\n7,000-8,000, Berlin is about 6,000 and no new facility will be built\nunless their Olympic bid is successful. Munich does have an arena. \n\n\nMalmo is big enough, but they also need a new arena...the current one has \n5,000 seats I think.\n\n\nIf we're talking about the NHL, even Helsinki would struggle to make it work.\nTurku (despite an excellent arena) and Tampere are nowhere near big enough for\nmajor league hockey.\n\n\n...Rome and the south are out of the question; this could as well be Africa\nto hockey fans. Romans were given the chance to host some WC'94 games but\nshowed no interest whatsoever. All teams in the Italian league come from Milan\nand the smaller cities in the north.\n\n\nParis had their own "Volans Francais"(sp) pro team a couple of years ago.\nI believe they even made it to the European Club Championship finals \ntournament one year, but eventually folded due to lower-than-hoped-for \nattendances. The remaining cities seem to be too small to support a minor \nsport like hockey.\n\n\nThe easter cities lack the money and infrastructure to support pro hockey.\n\n\nPerhaps . . . Most European teams will have to be like the Tampa Bay Lightning\nanyway; playing in a small 10,000 seat arena, backed by Japanese money, run by \nenthusiasts (Phil Esposito), heavy\nmarketing, fans that have difficulty telling what "icing" means... London has\nbeen mentioned, Sheffield and Birmingham also have large arenas and a new\nmega-facility (16,000 seats!) might be built in Bristol in a couple of years.\n\n\nNo facilities to speak of; their biggest arena (in Eindhoven) seats 2,500 \nfans for hockey.
Since everybody wants to see Pittsburgh players not playing, the\nStanley cup would be devaluated.\n\n-- \n_____________________________________________________\n\n  Iskander AYARI
un, you better add at least another plus to the Pederson\nfor Neely trade, the Bruins also received a number 1 round\ndraft pick, didn't play great this year but Wesley's still a\ndecent defenseman....

How long can the Leafs play short-handed and still be expected to\nscore?  They did some fine penely-killing in the first (2 men down\nfor a couple of minutes at one point) but they just couldn't keep it \nup.  They spent virtually the entire game either short-handed or\njust coming off a penelty -- as soon as they'd get re-grouped, they're\npenalized again!\n \nSheesh -- like Gilmour said after the 1st -- you can't go calling \nevery little push an shove in a game like that.  And if you're going\nto, you have to do it for both teams.\n \nPearson (one of my four favorite Leafs) played like a bonehead -- I\nsaw him personally screw up at least 2 good scoring opportunities, and\nthen he got that *bonehead* 5-minute major high-sticking penalty.\n \nCullen has gotten stronger since his return from injury a hand-full of\ngames ago and he played a good game.  If the other players on his line\ncan smarten up, that line should do okay.  Clark's got to get tough --\nhe's got to intimidate and go for the net.  Send Clark up the left \nwing over the blue line a couple times... his patented wrist shot will\nput some numbers on the board... and Pearson... heck, maybe he should\nbe benched.\n \nI hate to repeat Grapes, but where the heck was Foligno?  Zezel can't\ndo all the checking himself -- and get MacLlwain on the move... we \nneed some speed out there!  Keep Potvin in net, he did okay \nconsidering... although (like I said a couple weeks ago) Potvin \nmessed up in a couple games in the AHL playoffs last year -- he can \neasily do it again.\n \nMy prediction last week was Toronto in 7 -- that the games DET wins \nwill be blow-outs and the game TOR wins will be close -- I still stand\nby that.\n \nDon't fret, Leafs fans, in order to win in 7, the other team has to\nwin 3! :-)\n \nBurns is going to make some magic -- he'll mix up some lines.  Match\nthe Wings line-per-line.  He'll have his team checking hard, and he'll\nnever let them get out-numbered in their own end.  The Leafs will win\nWednesday night... and will take 1 or their home games (probably the\nfirst one).

All of this is fine.  I never said that Murray was a bad GM.  I merely said\nthat he isn't the best GM in hockey- or even a contender for that honor.\nIf Murray is as great as you claim- the Wings would have won the Stanley Cup\nby now- probably more than once.  If he was as great a GM as you claim\nand he was as poor a coach as you claim- he would have been intelligent\nenough to hire the coach to push the team to the next level of success.\nBut Murray is an average (unspectacular) NHL coach and a pretty good GM\nso none of this is true anyway.
Hmmmm, I'm not sure this is true.  According to Mike Lang and good old\nStagie, along with the rest of the TV crews in pittsburgh, they \nwinning streak could have stopped because it is a regular season mark.\nI would think this would also hold with an unbeaten streak for regular\nseason games.
Being a proud BU alumnus, I'd like to get a list of BU players in \nthe NHL so I can keep an eye on their progress. A lot of Terriers are\ngraduating this year so I hope to see them soon in the NHL. If somebody\ncould post or send me a list, I'd appreciate it. Please note if the player\ngraduated from here or not.
There are several problems with the way the game is being presented to the\nfans.  I feel that geographical names would enhance regional loyalties\nmore than names honouring personages.  And of course, they would not appear\nnearly as confusing to one approaching the sport for the first time.  \nAnother thing that bothers me is the points system.  Percentages, as used in\nthe other major sports are clearly more informative.  When I look at the\nNHL standings the first thing I have to do is make a quick calculation to\naccount for games in hand (which is almost always the case).  Some will\nobject to percentages, claiming perhaps, that it is an "Americanization"\nof the sport but I feel that using percentages is more informative and\nwhether it is "American" or not is irrelevant.\n \n\nEven if Orr couldn't have contributed without the likes of Norris, you would\nhave to agree that Norris couldn't have contributed without the likes of Orr.\nAnd taking a poll of most fans would quickly tell you who the fans feel made\nthe more meaningful contribution.\n\n\n\nIt doesn't look as if the division names are going to hold up either does it?\n\n\n--
How about Kevin Hatcher? Scored roughly 35 goals, plays 30 minutes a game.\n\n\nThat's really sad when two second-rate goalies (Barasso and Belfour)\nare the main contenders for the Vezina. Call me crazy, but how about\nTommy Soderstrom - five shutouts for a 6th place team that doesn't\nreally play defense. It's really unfortunate that the better goalies\nin the league (McLean, Essensa, Vernon) had unspectacular years. BTW,\nif you are going to award the Norris on the basis of the last 30 days,\nwhy not give the Vezina to Moog? He has been the best goalie over the\npast month.\n\n\n\n\n\nArbour or King. Burns will probably win, since playoffs aren't taken\ninto consideration - he's OK in the regular season, but I'm not sure\nif he's beaten anyone other than Hartford in the playoffs.
Sigh.\n	This was written about the game NHLPA Hockey '93. Which does not\nhave precise up-to-date rosters. Why don't people think before they post?\nJeez...
I have been to all 3 Isles/Caps tilts at the Crap Centre this year, all Isles\nwins and there is no justification for Vukota and Pilon to play for the Isles.\nVukota is absolutely the worst puck handler in the world!! He couldn't hit a\nbull in the ass with a banjo!! Al must remember a few years back when Mick \nscored 3 goals in one period against the Caps in a 5-3 Isles win. I was there\nand was astonished as was the rest of the crowd. Wake-up Al!!! Years later he's\ngotten worse. He's a cheap shot artist and always ends up getting\nstupid/senseless penalties. I think he would make a good police officier!!!\n\nAs for Pilon, he can't carry the puck out to center ice by himself. He either\nmakes a bad pass resulting in a turnover, or he attempts to bring the puck \ntowards the neutral zone and skates right into an opposing skater. He can't\nstay on his skates with most forwards or centers. He either falls down or \ncommitts a penalty. Call up somebody from Capital District AL!!!!!\n\nAs far as the playoffs, the Isles are as difficult to figure out as the Caps.\nTwo good teams with talent but so inconsistent. They should meet in the first\nround. The Isles seem to play up to the level of their competition so they\nshould play well against Jersey tonite. It'll probably be another tight 1-goal\ngame as the last 20 games hve been for the Isles. I wish when the get a lead\nthey could continue to pour it on instead of settling back into a defensive\nshell and letting the opposition get back in the game. Al MUST understand he\ncan't do with this team what he did with the 80-83 Isles. maybe Al should got\nto. Where is Bobby Nystrom?? Clark Gilles?? John Tonelli?? These are the kind\nof young minds we need behing the bench!!    FIRE AL!!!!\n\nJohn Scialdone\nSCIALDONE@NSSDCA.GSFC.NASA.GOV
True rumor.  Fact!  A big three way deal!\n\nEric Lindros going to Ottawa Senators.  And Senators get $15mill from\nMontreal.\n\nMontreal gets Alexander Daigle (the first round pick from Senators)\n\nPhilly gets Damphousse, Bellow, Patrick Roy and a draft pick.
Major league baseball has told the Blue Jays and the Expos not to\nsign Oscar Linares (I think that is his name)\n...Canada does not have the restrictions against\nCubans that the US has and other major league teams have told the\nCanadian teams that they would be very unhappy if the Expos or the\nBlue Jays would do this.  Cubans players would not have to defect\nto play in Canada and could play the 81 home games for the Expos\nand Blue Jays without any trouble.
: \n: Of course, penalties will have to be changed:\n: \n: Roughing:	Chauvanistic Males Being Aggressive\n: Slashing:	Chauvanistic Males Venting Frustration\n: Fighting:	Proof That Males Cannot Cope With Their Feelings\n: \n\nNO NO NO! since all the penalties fall into three classes, there should\nonly be three penalties:\n\n1. Foul (Any illegal contact with the other player or his stick with your\n   body or stick). If you get 5 you are out for the game.\n\n2. Unsportsmanlike contact. (An intentional foul). This inlcludes all the\n   current flavours of roughing, fighting and boarding. If you get two you\n   are thrown out of the game, and fined.\n\n3. Technical foul. Bad mouthing the ref, by player or coach. Penalty shot\n   is awarded. Two and you are thrown out of the game.\n\nBesides the penalty shot for one technical, if the team gets 5 penalties\nin a period, the opposing team gets a penalty shot for every additional one,\nuntil the end of the period. The victim gets two shots if he/she was in\nthe act of shooting when the foul ocured.\n\nThis works well for several reasons. First, penalty shots are the most\nexciting thing in hockey, right? So, it follows that the more the better.\nNext, when the player is setting up for a penalty shot, the network can\ntake a commercial. Finally, with only three penalties, the network\nannouncers (Don Meredith, Dick Vitale, John Madden, Pat Summerall, and\nMarv Levy, among others) will be able to tell the viewers what happened before\nthe PA announcer says it.\n\nOh, one other rule. When a goal is scored (10-20 times a period), the play\ncannot resume until the PA announcer announces it. This way, the network\ncan sneak in a few more commercials. Then, once the PA announcer has told\nthem who scored, the TV announcer can tell you the viewer, and even have a \nchance of pronouncing his name right.\n\nSeriously, though, I actually went to see a NBA basketball game last week,\nfor the first time in my life. I was amazed how boring it was. The play is\nso slow they actually had fans come out for things like free-throw shooting\ncontests DURING THE PERIOD!. Of course the 'Laker Girls' get to do their \nroutines at least 6-8 times during the game, and not just between periods\neither. There is a whistle every 30 seconds on average, maybe less. The\ngame is 48 minutes, with 2 minutes between quarters 1-2 and 3-4 and a\n10 minute halftime, and it still takes over 2 hours.\n\nThe reason for this has to be TV. There is plenty of room to throw in\ncommercials, and have the announcer jabber while nothing else is happening.\nOn TV, basketball is fairly entertaining, IMHO. But, it is better to watch\nit on TV than to be there. If this is the road the NHL is following, then\nit truly is a sad day.\n\nEnough for now.
Game two of the Detroit - Toronto series will be a rougher game.  I believe\nthat Clark will be coming out hitting on all cylindars.  I believe that Probert\nwill take exception to this and a fight between Clark and Probert will result.\n  I know this sounds kind of ridiculous, but I know game two Toronto will come\nout hitting.\n  Any takers on this issue?
They were, and even if Washington might consider Patty a bust, I'd rework\nthat trade in a minute.  Druce has been a complete and utter bust here,\nonly 5 goals.
Perish the thought...but you know, you may be right, at least as far\nas MAJOR LEAGUE professional sports teams go.  They all seem to be\nbecoming BIG MONEY games, much more so than at any previous time.  To\nthink that if I am ever able to move back home several years from now,\nall that may be there is an AHL team, at best...SIGH.
Well, the tentative rules, anyway.  And, of course, since the season is\nnot entirely over, tentative entry form.  But who cares?  The real hockey\nseason is starting!!!!!\n\nHere's the deal:  You email (preferably) or post your predictions, AND the\nnumber of games you think each series will go.  Each round will be\nweighted, so that the Stanley Cup finals will be very important, but the\nearly rounds will still be important.  Here is the scoring:\n\nPick 1st round winner, way off on games:  2 points\nPick 1st round winner, within one game:   3 points\nPick 1st round winner, pick # of games:   5 points\n\nPick 2nd round winner, way off on games:  3 points\nPick 2nd round winner, within one game:   4 points\nPick 2nd round winner, pick # of games:   6 points\n\nPick conference champ, way off on games:  5 points\nPick conference champ, within one game:   6 points\nPick conference champ, pick # of games:   9 points\n\nPick Stanley Cup champ, way off on games: 8 points\nPick Stanley Cup champ, within one game:  10 points\nPick Stanley Cup champ, pick # of games:  14 points\nPick loser in 7, series goes 7:           2 points\nPick loser in 7, series decided in Game 7, OT: 4 points\n(these last two are sympathy points, probably won't happen anyway)\n\nObviously, picking the Stanley Cup champion is important.  I will do some\ntests to see if the format is fair, but probably I will be too lazy to\nmodify it, so the scoring will probably be like this.  As for entry forms,\nwell, this post is getting too long, so see next post. \n\n--\n    Keith Keller				LET'S GO RANGERS!!!!!\n						LET'S GO QUAKERS!!!!!\n	kkeller@mail.sas.upenn.edu		IVY LEAGUE CHAMPS!!!!
from Dean:\n\nYes, you're right. After going home and reading the paper, I got the\nfull details. That's what I get for making a post based on WDUQ's news.\nI should know by now they get just about every sports related item wrong.
The FLYERS team that can beat any team on any night showed up at the Spectrum\nSunday night, and dominated the Maple Leafs thoroughly en route to a 4-0\nshutout. Tommy Soderstrom will get credit for the shutout, but he barely broke\na sweat until the third period as the FLYERS defense kept the Leafs from\nmounting any serious attack.\n\nInjuries:\n\nPelle Eklund is day-to-day with a bruised thigh.\n\nRoster Moves:\n\nJason Bowen was added to the lineup for his first NHL game. Jason was the FLYERS\nsecond pick in the first round (15th overall) of the 1992 entry draft. 19 years\nold, 6'4", 210 lbs. In 62 games with the tri-city Americans he had 10 goals,\n12 assists and 219 PIM. He plays left wing and defense, he played defense in\nthis game although Bobby Taylor said that Bill Dineen was planning to use him\nup front as well.\n\nAndre Faust was returned to Hershey. He actually left after the second period\nof the Kings game, flew to Albany, got the game tying goal in a Bears OT win,\nand played again for Hershey Sunday night.\n\nLines:\n\nFedyk-Lindros-Recchi\nBeranek-Brind'Amour-Dineen\nLomakin-Butsayev-Conroy\nActon-Brown\n\nGalley-McGill\nYushkevich-Cronin\nCarkner-Hawgood\nBowen\n\nTommy Soderstrom in goal.\n\nActon replaced Lomakin in the 3rd period.\n\nGame Summary:\n\nIf the FLYERS played like this every night, they'd be in the playoffs this\nyear. The FLYERS hit everything that moved. They created scoring chance after\nscoring chance. They snuffed out everything that the Leafs tried to do.\n\nJason Bowen made a good play on his first NHL shift that almost created a goal.\nHe had the puck in the top of the left offensive circle all alone, but instead\nof taking the shot he found Brind'Amour crashing the net on the other side.\nA perfect pass and a good shot across Daren Puppa's body should have been a\ngoal, but Puppa made a great save reading the play.\n\nGarry Galley gave the Maple Leafs 7th ranked power play the first chance when\nhe hooked Doug Gilmour at 4:25. The FLYERS lowly 21st ranked penalty killing\nunit was almost flawless the entire game, and set the tone on this kill. The\nMaple Leafs got almost nothing but long unscreened shots, and the defense swept\naway every rebound.\n\nAfter the power play, the FLYERS got a goal on an ugly play. Rod Brind'Amour\ngave the puck to Greg Hawgood at the right point, and he sent a drive at the\nnet. Puppa made the save and kicked the rebound right into the feet of Josef\nBeranek and Bob Rouse, who were wrestling in the slot. Beranek was able to\nget his stick on the puck and push it out to Dineen who was skating into\nthe slot from the right circle, and he lifted a backhander over Puppa for\na 1-0 FLYERS lead at 8:10.\n\nThe FLYERS kept the pressure on, and Puppa was the only Leaf keeping the FLYERS\nfrom building on their lead for a while. Eventually things settled down and\ndefense prevailed. Each team got an occasional scoring chance, but the goalies\nwere strong. Bowen started giving some Lindros-like checks in his own corners.\nThen Lindros, who was looking to avenge a hit Foligno gave him, thought he had\na chance to even the score. He had Foligno lined up at center ice, leaned into\nhim, and rode him into the center ice boards. The only problem was that Foligno\nwas a little far from the boards, and Mike "Mister" McGeough felt that it\nwarranted a boarding call at 15:38\n\nThe Leafs couldn't get anything going on the power play as the FLYERS were\nvery aggressive (for a change) on the kill.\n\nWith time running out in the period, Recchi carried through the neutral zone\nand handed to Lindros as they approached the Leaf's blue line. They were in\na crowd with Wendell Clark and Jamie Macoun, Lindros tried a backhand pass\nto Recchi through the feet of Macoun that connected to Recchi, but then Clark\nchecked Recchi off the puck. Macoun then tried to clear, but it was weak and\nwent right to McGill who had manned the point. He drove it from just inside\nthe blue line. Macoun got his stick on it and deflected it past his own\ngoalie at 19:55.1. Shots were 13-8 FLYERS in the period.\n\nThe FLYERS finally got their first chance on the power play when Dave Andreychuk\ntripped up Rod Brind'Amour in his offensive zone. During the power play, the\nFLYERS got cheated a little when the puck popped up into the air and Eric\ngloved it down, but McGeough thought it hit his stick above his head. We\ncould see from our seats at the other end of the ice that it only hit his glove\nand the replay confirmed, but the faceoff went to the other end. As time was\nrunning out in the advantage, Lindros found Galley with a pass across the goal\nmouth but Puppa made the save. The rebound kicked back to the right corner where\nRecchi picked it up, passed it out to Eric crashing through the right circle,\nand Eric one-timed past Puppa at 7:55. With the assist, Recchi moves past\nBobby Clarke's 74-75 season, the second best one season total for a FLYER at\n117.  Eric moves up to 4th all time in FLYERS rookie scoring with 67 points.\n\nMike Eastwood took down Al Conroy at 8:30 to give the FLYERS another chance on\nthe power play. Not much pressure before Garry Galley ended the power play with\na slash at 9:19. Not much happened on the 4 on 4, although the Leafs had most\nof the possession. The FLYERS smothered the Leafs short power play. Tempers\nflared a little at 13:14. Bowen and Pearson got roughing minors, Keith Acton\ngot a bloody face. Dave McLlwain then took a dive and got Greg Hawgood a\nhooking minor at 13:46 to set up a 4 on 3. The replay showed that Hawgood's\nstick stopped making contact with McLlwain long before he spun around and fell.\nAgain the FLYERS smothered the Leafs power play, led by Dimitri Yushkevich.\nBowen made a thundering hit when he came out of the box on Pearson. Berehowski\ntried to perplex everybody with his sloooowball. He had the puck at the point,\nand just trickled a pass down the slot. He made all the FLYERS look silly as\nnobody could get a stick on it, and it got to Gilmour at the side of the net,\nbut Soderstrom stoned him.\n\nThe FLYERS picked things up offensively after the kill was over, but didn't\nget anything home. Shots were 13-10 FLYERS.\n\nThe FLYERS were content with the 3 goal lead in the third period, and they\ndecided that if Tommy wanted a shutout, he was going to have to work for it a\nlittle.\n\nThe FLYERS got most of the scoring chances in the first 7 or so minutes of the\nperiod, but couldn't get past Puppa. Then the Leafs got tired of Lindros making\nroad kill out of them, and tempers flared. 2 each for Doug Gilmour and Lindros \n(unsportsmanlike conduct) and 2 each for Glenn Anderson and McGill (roughing)\nall at 7:02. Terry Carkner then took a kneeing penalty at 7:51 on Gilmour.\n\nAgain the FLYERS smothered the Leafs power play.\n\nAt about the 12 minute mark, Dave Andreychuk got a shot away from his left\ncircle that got through Soderstrom. The puck was rolling on it's side, and\nas luck would have it it turned away from the net instead of turning towards\nit (think of how a rolling quarter inevitably starts to lean one way or the\nother). Seconds later Rod Brind'Amour tripped up Gilmour at 12:24 to give the\nLeafs another chance on the power play. On the advantage, after Soderstrom\nstoned Andreychuk while lying down, Andreychuk got the rebound through\nSoderstrom, but from behind the net and it went straight through and was swept\naway by one of his defensemen. They kept the pressure on, but Soderstrom was\nequal and preserved the shutout.\n\nRecchi cross checked Ken Baumgartner to get tempers hot and start a brawl\nat 16:01. No punches thrown, Recchi got the initial minor, Krushelnyski\nBaumgartner and Lindros each got roughing minors. At 17:02 Rouse and Beranek\nexpressed their mutual dislike for each other and got 2 each for slashing to\nset up another 4 on 4. Mike Eastwood shoved down Ryan McGill in the FLYERS\nzone as they were battling for the puck, and while McGill was down he ran\nhis stick across McGill's face. The FLYERS were not happy with that at all.\n5-8 Al Conroy paired up with 6-1 Berehowski, and started throwing punches.\nUpward. Well, Al held his own, much to the delight of the crowd. Each got\na couple punches in before going down in a head, and Al got a standing O!\nPenalties: Eastwood 5 (cross check) + game, Clark, Carkner 10 each. Berehowski\nand Conroy 5 each (fighting) at 17:49.\n\nSo a major penalty for the rest of the game for the FLYERS. The had no interest\nin stting on the lead. Hawgood, Galley and Brind'Amour played catch until\nHawgood found Dineen all alone in the left circle, he controlled the puck and\nblasted it past Puppa at 18:39.\n\nThat was all the fireworks, Tommy Soderstrom would not face another shot. Puppa\ndid, but kept the FLYERS off the board. 4-0 FLYERS, shots were 9-8 FLYERS in the\n3rd. Probably the strongest game I've seen from the FLYERS since the All Star\nbreak. Shutout number 4 for Soderstrom, all since 1/10. Tied for 2nd most in\nthe NHL, but he's played fewer games than Belfour (6) or the goalie I can't\nremember that he's tied with.\n\nNext up it's the Winnipeg Selannes Tuesday night in Winnipeg. The FLYERS cannot\nbe eliminated if they win, but a loss coupled with an Islander win that night\nin Washington would be the official end.\n\nFLYERS up to 71 points on the season in 78 games. Last year they had 75 points\nin 80 games (5 under .500), so they need at least 8 points in their last 6\ngames to improve on that only by percentage points (5 under in 84 is better\nthan 5 under in 80).\n\nTragic number holds at 3 points with 6 games left. The tragic number for 5th\nis 5 points, I watched the Rangers blow a 4-2 third period lead at home to\nlose 5-4 before I finished this up. Why 5 points instead of 4? Well, the FLYERS\nwill win the tie-breaker if they catch them, whereas the Islanders win tie\nbreakers against the FLYERS and so need only a tie. The Rangers could crumble\ndown the stretch as they play the Devils, the Pens twice, the FLYERS, and\nfinish up with 2 games against the Caps. So I guess 5th place could be the\ngoal for the team to focus on.\n\nFLYERS team record watch:\n\nEric Lindros:\n\n38 goals, 29 assists, 67 points\n\n(rookie records)\nclub record goals:			club record points:\nEric Lindros	38 1992-93		Dave Poulin	76 1983-84\nBrian Propp	34 1979-80		Brian Propp	75 1979-80\nRon Flockhart	33 1981-82		Ron Flockhart	72 1981-82\nDave Poulin	31 1983-84		Eric Lindros	67 1992-93\nBill Barber	30 1972-73		Pelle Eklund	66 1985-86\n\nMark Recchi:\n\n51 goals, 66 assists, 117 points.\n\nclub record goals:			club record points:\nReggie Leach	61 1975-76		Bobby Clarke	119 1975-76\nTim Kerr	58 1985-86,86-87	Mark Recchi	117 1992-93\nTim Kerr	54 1983-84,84-85	Bobby Clarke	116 1974-75\nMark Recchi	51 1992-93		Bill Barber	112 1975-76\nRick Macliesh	50 1972-73		Bobby Clarke	104 1972-73\nBill Barber	50 1975-76		Rick Macliesh	100 1972-73\nReggie Leach	50 1979-80\n\nFLYERS career years:\n\nPlayer		Points	Best Prior Season\nMark Recchi	117	113 (90-91 Penguins)\nRod Brind'Amour	79	77 (91-92 FLYERS)\nGarry Galley	58	38 (84-85 Kings)\nBrent Fedyk	58	35 (90-91 Red Wings)\n\nThat's all for now...
Oh to be back in the good old days when I lived in Florida (Florida for\nPetes sake!!) and could watch hockey every night as ESPN and USA alternated\ncoverage nights. Oh well I guess it would be too simple for the home office\nto look back into their past to solve a problem in the present...\n\nOf course I shouldn't complain. At least I'm getting to watch the playoffs\nfor a change. (Hooray!!) Now if the ESPN schedulers will realise there are\nother teams except Pittsberg in the Patrick. (Sounds like a Dr Suess Book\n=)\n\nKOZ
As a person who has rarely even SEEN Don Cherry and doesn't know\nanything about him, I don't know whether it is just this area\n(Pittsburgh) of the USA that is "deprived" of his broadcasts or whether\nhe's a Canadian thing altogether.  Seriously, what is he all about?  I\nknow he was a coach at one time, and from the volume of posts about him,\nSOMEONE surely is getting a steady diet of him somehow, but my question\nis, what is the deal with him?  Secondly, are the comments of his that I\nread about on the net merely flame bait, or do people actually take him\nseriously?  I gotta tell you, from what I see, he really sounds like an\nass.  Let me know - maybe I'm missing something.
MLB is perfectly willing to take players from Cuba.  They just have to\ndefect first.  \n\nSort of like the situation used to be with Russian/Czech/etc hockey\nplayers, until the political situation in those countries changed.

DALLAS HELPS HAWKS STAY IN MONCTON\nAfter announcing that they would pull their affiliation out\nof Moncton, the Winnipeg Jets changed their mind. \n\nThe Jets announced the move when they said that they would be slashing\ntheir minor league roster from 20-something to around a dozen; and they\nwanted to share with an existing AHL or IHL franchise.\n\nEnter the Dallas Lone Stars. Dallas agreed to supply the remaining\n6 or 8 players to the Moncton franchise. Thus keeping the Hawks\nin the New Brunswick city.\n\nThe deal is for one year and will be extended to three years if\nthe season ticket base increases to over 3000. The Hawks only sold\n1400 for this year.\n\nSAINT JOHN FLAMES OFFICIAL\nThe Calgary Flames have officially signed a deal with the city of\nSaint John, NB. The Saint John Blue Flames will play in the 6200\nExhibition Center. The Flames still have to apply for an expansion\nfrnachise from the AHL but are expected to have no trouble.\n\nCAPS FOLLOW JACKS TO MAINE\nDespite rumors to the contrary, the Capitals will follow the Baltimore\nSkipjacks to Maine. The Caps' current farm team, the Baltimore Skipjacks,\nannounced that they would move to Maine and become the Portland Pirates.\nThere was much doubt as to if the Caps would follow but they announced\na limited deal with Portland. They would supply a dozen or so players\nincluding 2 goalies. They become the third team to announce a limited\nfarm team along with Moncton and the Capital District Islanders.

The Selke candidate forwards main purpose on a shift is to prevent goals\nfrom being scored- not to score them.  When Lemieux or Gilmour play their\nnumber one purpose is to score- defence is secondary- especially considering\nthe line that plays against them is probably a defensive one.  That is\nwhy they are not Selke candidates.\n\n\nSomeone posted something about this assumption being lost in translation\n(it was a few months ago).  Whoever this was please repost it.\n\n\nGainey is the best defensive forward ever.  I stand by that assessment.\nHe was a very good player who belongs in the hall of fame.  Did you\never watch him play? He never made a technical error.\n\n<Babbling deleted>\n\n\nWho are these pundits??  Gilmour was good with St Louis- but he was not the\nbest two-way player in the game when he was with them.  You have overhyped\nGilmour on this net for months.  He is a very good forward- but hardly the\nbest in the NHL.
[more about the Messier-Samuelsson incident]\n I agree with Rick that Ulf's cross check wasn't illegal. It was the kind\n of check you see a dozen times during a game without being called. Slo-mos\n sometimes have a tendency to make things look worse than they really are.\n Besides, if Messier can't take the heat, he should stay out of the kitchen.\n\n Well Matt, Mattias Timmander hasn't been playing with the MoDo elite league\n team yet (just the MoDo junior team), so I predict he needs a few more years\n here before he can join the B's. I saw him play in the Swedish championship\n game for junior players this year, and he played very well, a physical game,\n but not the kind of rough stuff that Ulfie does (I suspect you would like to\n have a Ulf type-of-player on the B's team too? :)\n As for Mariusz Czerkawski, he has had a *great* season for Hammarby in\n division 1. He scored -if I remember correctly- 93 points this season,\n and then we have to keep in mind that a 50+ point season in Sweden is\n considered *very good* due to the limited number of games. Mariusz is\n Djurgarden property (he was just on loan to Hammarby), so he will play\n in Elitserien next season, unless the B's can get him of course.\n I would say that Mariusz has to be one of the most exciting player to\n watch in Swedish hockey this season.\n\n Staffan
I think, as do the owners, that hockey will do well in Miami since there\nis a lot of people from the Northeast that spend their winters in\nFlorida every year. As for the coverage, someone will have to come up\nwith some money for that since broadcast rights can be expensive!\n\nJust my $0.02!\n\nDale
If the Islanders beat the Devils tonight, they would finish with\nidentical records.  Who's the lucky team that gets to face the Penguins\nin the opening round?   Also, can somebody list the rules for breaking\nties.
Well now that the hawks have won the division the road is a little\neasier for the playoffs. Let toronto and detroit beat the hell out of\neach other while Chicago sweeps st.louis. That just makes it easier in\nthe second round with all the rest they will get and tor/det getting\nnone. For the conf. champ they will have a hard time versus the division\nbut that div. will be pretty battered also so the advantage goes to the\nHawks again. Then bring pitt. and sure the Hawks will probably lose but\nits better to get that far and lose than to not go.
I'd have to take Quebec in 6.\n\n\nHawks will win, but it will take 5.\n\nCal in 7.\n\nBoston will beat Quebec in 6.\n\n\nPitt in 6. The Bruins arent a pushover.\nThe hawks havent had problems with them  all year. Yep, I agree.\n\nUnless the Hawks can somehow change fate, you're right.  \n\nWho knows, though.  Maybe some intensive forechecking aka normal Hawks\nstyle will nullify a seemingly unbeatable team.  Maybe the Pens are due\nfor a let-down.  Hell, how could they _possibly_ extend their record\nmaking play all the way through the playoffs.?
According to the hockey gurus over at ESPN, should the Islanders win tonite\nthe two teams will have the same record, but the Devils will be playing the\nPenguins.  This is because the Islanders have won the season series against\nthe Devils.  I think the rules for deciding a tie breaker include:\n\n1.  season series\n2.  goals against\n3.  goals for\n\nin this order (correct me if I'm wrong).  Anyone have anything to add?\n\nCraig
In the game *I* have seen yesterday in the Olympiahalle of Munich\nCanada won 4-1 against Sweden! The last goal for Canada was at 19:59 in\nthe 3rd period. Maybe you shouldn't go and get you another beer \nbefore the game is over and then post imaginary results...\n\nHolger
Just curious, Roger, but since you have such a vast knowledge of the\ngame and the league, how come you haven't made a living out of it?\nThere must be a lot of demand for expertise in the field. I'm sure\nyou'd be of great help to, say, the Leafs as an assistant coach or\na scout. Or maybe try a career as a reporter or tv commentator...\n \nI might be wrong, of course, and you already have.

The first time I heard this piece of news was on the post game radio\ninterview here in Jyvaskyla. That was the bronze medal game in the \nSM-liiga which Tichonov's team Porin Assat (the Aces of town Pori:)\nlost.  Vasili, the son of Victor Tichonov (the famous Soviet coach),\nsaid that for a long time the Sharks have been persuading him to\ntake the assistant coach post. But he wants to be the head coach where\never he goes. He definitely won't be coaching Assat anymore (after\nthree? seasons). I don't know why.\n\nVasili is a good coach I believe. Assat was a good team, produced many\nplayers to our national team. Assat wasn't a skilled team (IMHO) but\nthey had the fighting spirit. After all, they butchered Jokerit in the\nplayoffs and gave hard time to TPS, the champs. But Assat wasn't\nconsistent, only when they were in the right mood they could beat any\nteam in the SM-liiga.\n\nI am not 100% sure about the deal with the Sharks. As I said, he wants\nto be the head coach. But he and the Sharks are going to negotiate and\ndecide during the WC. I doubt that he will be the head coach but\nmaybe they'll do some compromise.
By Dave Luecking Of The Post-Dispatch Staff\n\nAt 9:11 Thursday night, the scoreboard watchers at The Arena began to cheer.\nTheir cheer quickly turned into a roar, and finally, the sellout crowd of\n17,816 rose as one to rock the old barn at 5700 Oakland Avenue in a salute to\nthe playoff-bound Blues.\n\nThe scoreboard had just flashed the news from Detroit -- Red Wings 5, Stars 3.\nWith the North Stars' loss, the Blues officially clinched fourth place and the\nfinal playoff spot in the Norris Division. Good thing, because the Blues quit\nplaying.\n\nThey held a 5-1 lead over Tampa Bay when the Detroit-Minnesota final appeared\nwith 3 minutes 52 remaining in the second period. They promptly went to sleep\nand barely held on for a 6-5 victory that nearly slipped away at the buzzer.\nTampa's Bob Beers tipped in a pass from Shawn Chambers, but officiating\nsupervisor John D'Amico and video goal judge Rich Schweigler ruled that the\nshot had gone into the net after time had expired.\n\n``I'm glad I didn't see it go in at the end," Blues coach Bob Berry said.\n\nIf the goal had counted, he'd have been more upset than he was by the Blues'\ndisappearance in the final 24 minutes. Holding on for the victory and making\nthe playoffs tempered Berry's anger.\n\n``It wasn't pretty at the end," he said. ``We played 36, 37 great minutes, as\ngood as we played all year. It slipped away at the end. It shouldn't have, but\nit did."\n\nStill, the Blues won, prompting another ovation from the crowd at game's end.\nDespite their shoddy effort in the third period and all the turmoil this\nseason, the Blues still made the playoffs. They'll meet the Chicago Blackhawks\nin a best-of-seven Norris Division semifinal, beginning at noon Sunday at\nChicago Stadium.\n\nThe Blues finished the regular-season with a record of 37-36-11 for 85 points,\ntheir fourth consecutive plus-.500 season. Minnesota finished three points\nbehind in fifth place, with a record of 36-38- 10 for 82 points. Tampa Bay,\nwhich played spoiler last week by tying the Blues 2-2 at Tampa, ended its\nfirst season with a record of 23-54-7 for 53 points.\n\nThe poor finish cast an unnecessary shadow over what should have been a joyous\nBlues locker room. Instead, the mood was one of relief and some disappointment.\n\n``It's a shame we let down," said Kevin Miller, one of three Blues to score\ntwo goals. Brendan Shanahan and Bob Bassen were the others.\n``There was no need for a letdown. If we'd have kept working, it would have\nended 6-2 and everyone would be happy."\n\nInstead, a lot of players were happy just to make the playoffs.\n``We won, and that's all that matters," said Brett Hull, scoreless and minus-3\nfor the night. ``Once we got up 4-0, it was really tough to play."\n\nSome players didn't have a problem.\n\n``Just because the score was announced, our line didn't quit," said Rich\nSutter, who played with Bassen and Miller. ``We still had a game to play. You\ncan't allow five goals like we did, that's not right.\n\n``It was disappointing to see what was going on."\n\nBassen was almost frantic on the bench because of the Blues' effort. Somehow,\nhe missed the announcement of Minnesota's loss.\n\n``I didn't know it was final," he said. ``I was kind of looking around on the\nbench. I didn't realize it was a final for some reason. We're in the playoffs,\nand that's great, but it's a little disappointing to play like we did at the\nend."\n\nThe letdown was precisely the reason that Berry had instructed the scoreboard\noperators to keep the Minnesota-Detroit score off of the board. The score\nshowed 0-0 until it first popped up with Detroit leading 4-2 in the third\nperiod. The Blues already led 4-0 at the time.\n\n``I told them I didn't want to see the score, I didn't want to know the score,"\nBerry said. ``I felt we had to win the game, and that's the approach we took."\n\nIf Minnesota took a lead, Berry feared, the pressure of having to win might\nbother the Blues. If Detroit led, he worried, the Blues might quit.\n\nUntil the announcement, the Blues played splendidly. Shanahan got the crowd\ngoing at 10:44 of the first period, scoring his 50th of the season. Then,\nMiller and Bassen took charge late in the period.\n\nWith the teams playing four on four, Miller broke in on left wing, deked\ndefenseman Roman Hamrlik and beat former Blues goalie Pat Jablonski with the\nrebound of his own shot with 21.6 seconds remaining in the period.\n\nThen, just 10.5 seconds later, Bassen rifled a long slap shot past Jablonski\nafter defenseman Rick Zombo intercepted a Tampa pass in the neutral zone.\n\nBassen made it 4-0 just 14 seconds into the second period, scoring on the \nrebound of Bret Hedican's shot. The goal gave him his first two-goal game of\nthe season and reminded him of a special friend.\n\nLast year, Bassen befriended young Oliver Mulvihill, who died of a rare form\nof cancer at age 6 on Feb. 23.\n\n``I was thinking of my buddy Oliver," Bassen said. ``He's in heaven now, and\nI know he was watching. I know he's happy."\n\nMiller increased the Blues lead to 5-0 on a break-away goal set up by Zombo\nat 11:09. Then, Steve Maltais broke Curtis Joseph's shutout just 18 seconds\nlater, making it 5-1.\n\nLess than a minute after the North Stars' final was announced, Tim Bergland\nscored and cut the lead to 5-2. But Shanahan scored his 51st, converting a pass\nfrom Nelson Emerson with 21.3 seconds remaining in the  second period.\n\nThen, it was all Lightning. Adam Creighton scored 40 seconds into the third\nperiod, prompting Berry to rest the overworked Joseph. Guy Hebert allowed goals\nto Shawn Chambers and Danton Cole in a span of 1:21 midway through the third\nperiod.\n\nThe goals by Chambers and Cole made Shanahan's second goal stand up as the\nwinner. ``We were in there," Shanahan said. ``The game was over. We were in."

Oh, excuse me for wasting the bandwidth, but I was referring to \nthe original incident, not the recent skirmish which occurred\nthis past month.
Well, I don't recall assuming anything, except perhaps that the columnist \nwho reported the incident was telling the truth i.e. the sarcastic impression\ncame from _him_ (Steve Simmons?).  Besides, to my knowledge Alex has a pretty\nfair grasp of the English language...and his recent comment after the Detroit\ngame would indicate that this remark _is_ what I think it to be.  Very low.
This is incorrect.  This year the Pens had 61 games on "free" TV and 6\ngames on PPV.  Next year they will have 62 games on free TV and 22 on \na subscription basis.  \n\nYou actually get 1 more free game than last year, and there will be no\nmore "radio-only" games.\n\nIts a good deal.  Last year, everybody bitched about Baldwin "breaking\nup the team".  Now, he goes out of his way to keep the nucleus of this\nteam together and that takes money.  He comes up with a creative way\nto generate more revenue so he can afford this team, and people bitch\nsome more.\n\nEverybody wants something for nothing.\n\nDean\n\n--
Question:\nIf a team uses 40 players in a season do you merely divide the total +/-\nby 40?  If so, a player who plays in only 1 game is considered equally\nvaluable as a player who plays in all of them.\n\n\nSince the standard deviation for each team is different, I am unsure how \n"transferable" between teams that these stats are.  Shouldn't the average\nstandard deviation in the league be used?\n\nI am interested in seeing each method.\nBut I still think that mine is the best. If for no other reason than familiarity.

Is there any games being shown here in the US from the WC???\n\nThanks
Yes, it's a shame that the NHL lost a fine team in one of the best\nhockey markets in the country.  Being a North Stars fan, it is sad to\nsee all of the tradition of the last 26 years get thrown into oblivion\nat the hands of a truly crappy owner.\n\nHopefully the NHL will install an expansion franchise in the Twin Cities\nwithin the next five years.  Even if this is the case, a lot has been\nlost in the North Stars move...
Sheesh.  The rumor mill strikes again.  But let's just assume this were true.\nMy question is this:\n\nWhat would Montreal give San Jose if the Sharks got first pick and took Daigle?
Okay, here's the down side of the ESPN deal: no additional coverage.\nWith a split contract, SCA could have at least gotten at leftovers\nlike Canucks-Jets, Caps-whoever and Red Wings-Leafs (or whoever else\nis playing).\n\n\nFor our area (Islanders-Devils), it's likely to be the Bruins, since\nthe other Adams series is Montreal-Quebec.  I'd prefer the latter\nmyself ...\n\nI'm under the impression that the ABC deal overrides the local deals,\nbut if St. Louis at Chicago pops up we'll know ...\n\ngld
KDKA has first rights to Pirates games, and will split probably 50-50\nin conflicts; for Penguins games which are preempted, check out \n102.5 WDVE FM (that's right, DVE).  It is also 50,000 watts.
1st round: \n----------\n\nPITT vs NYI:  PITT in 4. \n\nIt looks like a safe bet.  NYI has been bagging it of late.\nNYI and NJD have a showdown Friday night for the honour\nof Pittsburg anyway.  Pigsburg in 4.\n\nWASH vs NJD:  WASH in 6. \nI think that NJD have a solid team and will compete with\nWASH.  I agree though with WASH in 6.\n\nBOS  vs BUF:  BOS  in 5. \nThe B's have been playing awesome hockey in the last\ntwo weeks.  The only question is how long will it last?\nFuhr is a dud.  BOS in 4.\n\nQUE  vs MON:  MON  in 7.\nIt seems to me that MON is much like the VAN - no chemistry.\nThe Habs seem to be not in stride. QUE in 5.  \n\nCHI  vs STL:  CHI in 4. \nSTL should not be in the playoffs. CHI in 4.\n\nDET  vs TOR:  DET in 6.\nI am a diehard Leaf fan but ... It seems that the Leafs\noffense is shutting down in the last week.  Can they\nturn it around against Detroit.  As I recall, the last\ncouple of time these two teams met, the Leafs were pummelled.\nI don't know if Bobbie is allowed in Canada yet.  If he is,\nDET in 5.  If not, DET in 6.\n\nVAN  vs WIN:  WIN in 6.\n\nUpset in the making here.  Another team with bad chemistry.\nThere is something gone foul among Linden, Momesso and Bure.\nWIN in 6.\n\nCAL  vs  LA:  CAL in 5.\nAnybody that says that LA could possibly beet CAL does\nnot watch the Smythe a whole lot.  LA is a bunch of Geritols.\nCAL in 4.\n\n\n2nd round: \n----------\n\nPITT vs WASH: PITT in 4. \nIt seems to me that Pigsburg has some egos on their team.  Their\nsaving grace though is Bowman.  He can put anybody in their place.\nHowever, if PIGS have a quick first round, they may be a little\ntoo high.  WASH could be there for a surprise.  Having said that,\nI will say PITT in 6.\n\nBOS  vs MON:  BOS  in 6.\nMON will not be there.  BOS is surprising me of late. Cam is great.\nThe couple of wins against QUE last week have sold me with the\nB's.  B's in 6.\n\n\nCHI  vs DET:  CHI  in 7.\nYikes.  This will not be pretty.  But DET is running like a machine\nof late.  They've had a non-busy end of the season in which they played\nlike killers.  DET in 6.\n\nWIN  vs CAL:  CAL  in 5.\nCAL has a solid team, a little weak in the nets.  CAL will out\nmuscle WIN.  CAL in 5.\n\n3rd round: \n----------\n\nPITT vs BOS:  PITT in 5. \n\nI hate PITT.  My logic eludes me.  The dark side will take over\nand give BOS the extra push it needs to dump PITT.  There may\nbe something to this - if you think of the rivalry.  BOS in 7.\nCHI  vs CAL:  CHI  in 5. \n\nFinals:\n------\n\nPITT vs CHI: PITT in 5. \n\nNO, no, no.  We have BOS vs DET.  I don't know what to say\nhere.  Both teams will be flying and overdue.  I will go\nwith goaltending and muscle and say DET in 7.
As I promised, I would give you the name of the Panther's president.\nAfter Huizenga announced the team name, he announced that Bill\nTorrey is named the first president of the Panthers.\n\nA little Bio from _Sun-Sentinel_\nTorrey, the architect of four consecutive Stanley Cup champions as \npersident and general manager of the New York Islanders.\nThroughout his 27 years in the NHL, Bill Torrey's bow ties have become\nas much of a signature as Andre Agassi's hair.\n\nThe Panthers will introduce a uniform, insignia, and ticket-price \ninformation in early next month.  In the meantime, Huizenga leaves the\nday-to-day operation in the hands of Torrey and Bob Clarke, the VP and\nGM.\n\nThe Florida Panthers was chosen as the name of South Florida's NHL team\nto focus attention on an endangered species.  There are 30 to 50 Florida\nPanthers in the Everglades National Park, the Big Cypress National \nPreserve and other parts of southwestern Florida.\n\n"The Panther is the quickest-striking of all cats," Torrey said.  \n"Hopefully that's the way we'll play on ice."\n\nMore BIO:\nIn Torrey, Huizenga has the first man hired by the expansion Islanders\nin 1972 and the one most responsible for guiding the Islanders to four\nconsecutive Stanley Cup championships (their first after only eight\nseasons) and 14 consecutive winning seasons.  As executive vice president\nof the California Golden Seals, Torrey watched the Seals go to the play-\noffs in 1968, only their second NHL season.\n\n"I guess this completes my own personal hat trick", said Torrey, 58, a\nnative of Montreal but a resident of Bear Lakes Country Club in Palm\nBeach.\n\nJim G.\nother accounts:\ngorycki@sol.cse.fau.edu\njimg@cybernet.cse.fau.edu\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n"I repeat myself when under stress. I repeat myself when under stress.\nI repeat myself when under stress. I repeat myself when under stress.\nI repeat..."  Adrian Belew, "Indicipline"
from Anna Matyas:\n\nYeah, and also be second in the team in scoring and play about 35\nminutes a game and play on the power play and kill penalties and be the\nbest defenseman in the league. I'd take a whole team of Chelioses if I\ncould. (That way, when one got a penalty the others could kill it!)
Hm, do you think Dusseldorf fans would like it if their team joined the NHL?\nOr do we have to include Koln as well (Cologne to you Anglophiles) to make \nthem happy?:-)
Here is a press release from the White House.\n\n Remarks by President Clinton to NCAA Division I Champion Hockey Team\nApril 19; Q&A Following\n To: National Desk\n Contact: White House Office of the Press Secretary, 202-456-2100\n\n   WASHINGTON, April 19 -- Following is a transcript\nof remarks by President Clinton to the University of Maine "Black\nBears" NCAA Division I hockey champions:\n\n                           The Rose Garden\n\n 9:58 A.M. EDT\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  Good morning ladies and gentlemen.  It's\nan honor for me to welcome the University of Maine Black Bears, the\nwinner of the NCAA Division I hockey national championship to the\nRose Garden and the White House.  I understand from Senator Mitchell\nthat this is the first team from the University of Maine every to win\na national championship.  And we're glad to have them here.\n\n     I'm inspired not only by how the team pulled together to\nwin the championship, but how the entire state pulled together to\ncheer them onto victory.\n\n     Coming from a state that is also relatively small in\nsize, but also filled with pride and tradition and community, I can\nunderstand how the people of Maine must feel about the Black Bears.\nIn our state people are still talking about the time we won the\nOrange Bowl over the number one ranked football team, and that was\nback in 1978.  I'm sure that 15 years from now, the people of Maine\nwill as proud of this team as they are today.\n\n     You know, in my state football is a slightly more\npopular sport than hockey.  We don't have a lot of ice.  (Laughter.)\nBut after spending three months getting banged around in this town, I\ncan understand a little more about hockey than I did before I came\nhere.  Hockey is a tough game.  It's a hard-hitting sport.  It does\nhave one virtue though, there's a penalty for delay of game.  I wish\nwe had that rule in the Senate.  (Laughter.)\n\n     In government as in hockey, leadership is important.  In\nthe United States Senate, our team has a great captain, the Majority\nLeader and the senior Senator from Maine, George Mitchell; junior\nSenator -- Cohen looks so young, I can't imagine.  (Laughter.)  I'm\nactually bitter about Senator Cohen because he looks so much younger\nthan me.\n\n     On your hockey team, the captain Jim Montgomery has done\na great job.  He scored the winning goal late in the championship\ngame, leading you to a come-from-behind victory -- something else I\nknow a little bit about.\n\n     Sport brings out the best in individuals and in teams\nand in communities.  I share the pride that Senator Mitchell and\nSenator Cohen and Congressman Andrews and all the people of Maine\nmust feel for the Black Bears who have shown us all how to play as a\nteam, how to bring out the best in one another, and how to come from\nbehind.\n\n     I think it's important, as I ask young people from\naround America who have achieved outstanding things in working\ntogether, to come here to the White House to be recognized and\nappreciated by their country, to remember that those kinds of values\nand those kinds of virtues need to be ingrained in all of us for all\nof our lives.\n\n     We now have another role model, and I'm glad to have\nthem here today.  (Applause.)\n\n     (The President is presented with team jersey.)\n(Applause.)\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  That's great.  I love it.  It's beautiful.\n(Applause.)\n\n     (The President is presented with an autographed stick.)\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  That's great.  (Applause.)\n\n                             * * * * * *\n\n     Q  Mr. President, did you authorize the move on Waco\nthis morning, sir?\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  I was aware of it.  I think the Attorney\nGeneral made the decision.  And I think I should refer all questions\nto her and to the FBI.\n\n     Q  Did you have any instructions for her as to how it\nshould be executed?\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  No, they made the tactical decisions.\nThat was their judgment, the FBI.\n\n     Q  Is this a raid?\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  And I will -- I want to refer you to --\ntalk to the Attorney General and the FBI.  I knew it was going to be\ndone, but the decisions were entirely theirs, all the tactical\ndecisions.\n\n     Q  What did you and Senator Mitchell talk about this\nmorning?\n\n     Q  Any chance for that stimulus package?\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  Senator Mitchell ought to pay my\nquarter.  (Laughter.)  I was in there -- (laughter).\n\n     SENATOR MITCHELL:  You have to pay that quarter.\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  I was ready.  (Laughter.)  Senator\nMitchell, he's worth a quarter any day.\n\n     Q  Any chance for your bill, sir?\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  We talked about what was going to happen\nthis week in the Senate and about what other meetings we're going to\nhave for the rest of the week.  We only had about five minutes to\ntalk.  And we agreed we'd get back together later, around noon, and\ntalk some more.\n\n     Q  Senator Dole said over the weekend that your\ncompromise is no compromise.\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I know he did, but, look, Senator\nDole and a lot of the other Republicans now in the Senate voted for\nthe same kind of thing for Ronald Reagan in 1983; and our research\nindicates that a majority of them over time voted for a total of 28\nemergency spending measures totalling over $100 billion when Reagan\nand Bush were President, in those administrations.  And many of those\npurposes were not nearly as worthy as putting the American people\nback to work.  I don't want to go back and revisit every one, but you\n\n\ncan do it.  You can look at the research there.  So this position\nthey're taking is not credible.  We have a very tough five-year\ndeficit reduction plan.  All these costs are covered during that time\nand then some.  And the very people that are saying this has all got\nto be paid for don't have much of a history on which to base their\nposition.  They've got 12 years of vote for stimulus measures of this\nkind that had very little to with putting the American people back to\nwork.  So I think we've got a chance to work it out, and I'm hopeful.\nWe'll see what happens today and tomorrow.  I'm feeling pretty good\nabout it.\n\n     THE PRESS:  Thank you\n\n                                 END       10:10 A.M. EDT\n\n -30-
Perhaps it was Trottier.  It happened behind the Habs goal if I recall.\nGainey simply didn't have his head up as he was picking up the puck.\n\n\nIf Gilmour was taken completely by surprise, as Gainey was, then yeah,\nI would have to say that Doug wasn't playing "technically" smart \nhockey.  In any case, to claim as Greg did, that Gainey *never* made \na technical mistake is absolutely ludicrous.\n\n\nGood for you.  You'd only be displaying your ignorance of course, but to \neach his own...\n\n\nI think Gainey should feel honoured to know that he is remembered at \nall.\n\n\nCertainly pluggers are an integral part of any team.  And that is\nsimply because there are not enough solid two-way players to go \naround.  Who would you rather have as your "checking" centre?  Doug\nGilmour or Doug Jarvis?  For that matter I would take either Gretzky\nor Mario as my "checking" centres.  Do you think Gretzky could cover\nBob Gainey? \n\n\nYou're wrong again.  The Selke is awarded to the forward that does the\nbest job defensively and this may or may not be the best plugger.  If \nGilmour does the best defensive job in the league I don't see why he \nshould be out of the running simply because he also contributes offen-\nsively.\n\nSettle down?  If you think that I have likened the Selke to the Nobel\nprize then I suggest that you had best "settle down".  And if you are\ngoing to try to put words in my mouth, let me suggest that you "settle \ndown" before you bother following up on my postings. \n\n\nYou might consider developing your own style.  After all, imitation is \nthe sincerest form of flattery and I am quite sure that flattery is not \nyour intention.\n\ncordially, as always,\n\nrm
Oh yeah, how come Dino could never take the Caps out of the Patrick\nDivision?  He choked up 3 games to 1 last year and got swept away in\nthe second round two years ago.  He rarely, if ever, makes it out of the\ndivision.\n\n\nSo are the Islanders, but they can still pull it out.  Vancouver has Winnipeg's\n number, so it really doesn't matter.\n\n\n\n Kings always seem to go at least 6 or 7, they never play a four or five\ngame serious.  There's a difference between battling it out and pulling it\nout, as I take Calgary to pull it out in 7.

I don't buy this at all. Roy was the reason the game was tied... and that\nwould *not* have been the case had Dionne kept his cool. \nHextall gave up 2 very questionable goals himself ...\nBoth Dionne's and Bellows' shots were misplayed by Hextall, but just because\nhis gaffes were early in the game, no one seems to care. Roy stood on his head \nfor the first 15 minutes of the game when the Nords were rushing from \nend-to-end. Kamensky's mini-break after the tying goal and the first shot by \nYoung in OT were both excellent chances stopped by Roy. Roy outplayed Hextall \nfor most of the game, but Roy becomes the villain and Hextall the hero \nbecause Roy's team didn't make full use of their opportunities.\n\nHextall, on the other hand, had a lot of lucky bounces ... he played very \nwell, but the Haller shot off the post in OT, the rebound bouncing over \nBellows' stick, the Brunet breakaway, the 3 chances for LeClair ... all \nthose opportunities were *not* finished off by Montreal, and it cost them.\nHextall wasn't particularly brilliant on those plays ... \n\n\nSure, no excuse ... but it was just the 1 goal. The timing stank, but against\nan explosive team like Quebec, they gave them 1 opportunity too many with\na powerplay that was totally unnecessary.\n\n\nI disagree. Roy played well because he wasn't screened the whole night. \nThe defense, for the 1st time this season, played remarkably, keeping Sakic,\nNolan, and Sundin  out of the slot most of the night.\n\n\nThis most certainly was a team loss... Leclair missed his opportunities,\nas did Bellows and Brunet. Dionne took a bad penalty. Damphousse and Lebeau\nwere *silent*. Carbonneau and Savard were a step behind all night. Roy gave\nup the bad goal. Roy, by no means, can be singled out for this loss.\n\n\nAnd Hextall didn't on Dionne's goal? Please. Roy is paid big money because\nthat is his value compared to other goalies ... and he still is in the top 5,\nwhen you consider the defense, or lack of one, that played in front of him\nfor most of the season.\n\n\nThe Montreal media is the quickest to heap praise and then hurl derogatory\ncomments against the Habs. They are no better than uninformed fans. Why should\nthey read the papers? They played 58 minutes of "Burnsian" hockey to shut\ndown Quebec. All they need tonight, and for the rest of the series is the \nextra 2.\n\nRed Light to face Quebec...rubbish. That's a guaranteed way to end the\nseries 4-0. Who would be taught a lesson by this ?\nThe fans, the media, and Racicot, perhaps. Certainly not the rest of the team.\n\n\nIf you mean the goal should never have gone in, because there should never\nhave been an OT, then I agree. But the goal itself was a great piece of work\nby Young. Roy had both the near and far posts covered, but Young flipped the\npuck up under Roy's arm as he wrapped-around the net ... not a bad goal at all.
Well Bruins fans it's playoff time again.\nIt looks like the B's have peaked at the right time.\nGetting out of the Adams is going to be a cat fight to the end.\nAfter what they did to Montreal and Quebec, these teams will be out for\nrevenge. If Neely can stay healthy, and both Bourque and Moog stay sharp,\nwe should get to see Neely finally take out two years of frustration \non Ulf (I don't fight) Samuelson. I don't agree with fighting in the NHL,\nbut if there is one guy who deserves to be taken out good, it's him.\n\nThis is going to be a good series, Go Bruins!!!!
I don't think Primeau is necessarily a bad pick...I'm was just trying\nto locate the beginning of Murray's decisions...he slowness in trading\nCarson has delayed Primeau's development...and you have to wait longer\nfor big players often...and Primeau can be a very good player without\nbeing a point-a-game-player, especially on a team that has Yzerman and\nFedorov...if Primeau becomes Joel Otto, and gets 20 goals a season,\nand plays mean...it will have been an extremely good pick.
The Leafs have always been kind of comical.  During the second  Imlach\nera, when Darryl Sittler was called a "cancer on the team", he tore the\nC off his sweater and for a while the Leafs didn't have a Captain.\n\nSittler eventually ended up in Philly and he was promised  the  Philly\ncaptaincy  by  new  GM  (and Sittler's friend) Bobby Clarke.  Instead,\nSittler got traded to Detroit.\n\nRick Vaive was the Leaf Captain for awhile but he slept in one day and\nthey took the captaincy away from him.  Then he was traded to Chicago.\n\nDuring Doug Carpenter's tenure as Leaf coach, in an  attempt  to  kiss\nthe  ass of a sulking Gary Leeman, the Leafs took the A away from Brad\nMarsh to give to Leeman.  Leeman wouldn't take it and when they  tried\nto give it back to Marsh, he wouldn't take it neither.\n\nThe best story I remember about a captain concerned Mel Bridgman, late\nof the Senators.  While he was in Philadelphia, Bobby Clarke, arguably\none of the great captains of all time, was bumped up to the status  of\nplaying coach and so he had to relinquish the captaincy.  Bridgman be-\ncame the new captain.  A reporter asked a Flyer what Bridgman did as a\ncaptain  since  Clarke  was  still  the  undisputed leader amongst the\nplayers.  The reporter was told that Bridgman was in charge of  making\nsure that the soap dispensers in the showers were always full.\n\n\n--

It is a long standing good luck Redwing's tradition to throw an octopus \non the ice during a Stanley Cup game. They say it dates back to '52\nat the Olympia when the Wings became the 1st team (I think) to sweep \nthe cup in 8 games. A lot hardet to throw one from Joe Louis seats\nthan from the old Olympia balcony, though.
Does anyone have the NHL STANDINGS for March 28th? I need them IMMEDIATELY\nfor a project. Please post or email. THANKS.
First of all, the Penguins WILL win the cup again.  Who is going to stop them?\nDefinitely not the Canucks! \n\nMy predictions:\n\nPatrick Division winner:  Pittsburgh\nAdams Division winner:  Quebec or Montreal\nNorris Division winner:  Detroit\nSmythe Division winner:  Winnipeg\n\nWales conference champ:  Pittsburgh\nCampbell Conference champ:  Detroit\n\nStanley Cup Champions(again):  Pittsburgh\n\nCanucks suck.  They'll lose in the first round, compliments of Winnipeg\nand Teemu Selanne.
Listen, *ASSHOLE*, I'm just commenting on what I heard \nreported on the sports news!!\n\nYou'll notice my skeptical comment!  Sheesh... I thought this group \nwasfor conversation!  Guess I was wrong. }-<
Well what do you expect...Burns was playing him with Krushelnyski\nand Baumgartner...Anderson is a finisher...unless you play him with\nsomeone to can get him the puck in a finishing position...he ain't\ngoing to do much scoring!
What are the Leafs to do?  I am a Leaf supporter and\nI say the Leafs are going down in four unless there\nis nothing short of a miracle or a stroke of genenius hits\nPat Burns.\n\nIf you were Pat Burns what would you do?\n\nLiving in the Bay area, I do not get enough Leaf coverage\nto pull something out of the bag,  (I would appreciate comments\non the Leaf/Detroit 3rd line match-ups)  but here is the basic\nidea...\n\nAndreychuck and Borchevsky have no business playing against \nthe Wings.  They are too small.  The key to any Leafs success\nwill have to be Clark.  He is the only centre who can have\nany presence within 3-stick lengths of the slot.  Where the\nhell is Anderson?  Anderson can (in days past) get under peoples\nskin.  Put a little more bluntly, Anderson has to be an asshole.\nHe used to be good at it.  We need him now.  \n\nPerhaps, perhaps the Leafs can shut down Detroit's second line.\nI was dissappointed to see Shepard and Yserbeart flying last night.\nThese guys are the "swing" players for the Wings.  Last year they\ndid a major choke in the playoffs and were to blame for the quick\nexit of the Wings.  **THis has to happen again**.   Clark-Anderson-Gilmour\nshould be able to out hustle this line.  Anderson should do a\nnasty on Yserbeart.  Clark should bang the hell out of Sheppard.  \nScore Gilmour score!\n\nSuggestions:  Clarke-Anderson-Gilmour vs. Sheppard-Yserbeart-??\n	      Andreychuck-Borchevsy-??  vs. Detroit checking line\n	      Toronto's checking line  vs. Yzerman-Fedorov-Probert (pray lots)\n\n* as suggested - i would bench Andreychuck and Borchevsky to stir things up\n		 and through a monkey wrench into Detroits game plan.  However,\n		if the Detroit coaching would be dumb enough to play their\n		checking line against these "finesse" players - well then\n		let them play.\n\n** Potvin can not be faulted on 5 of the goals - keep him in.\n** Van Hellamond can not be faulted for the Leafs demise either.\n** The Wings defense shut down the Leafs (especially in the slot).\n\nI hope Pat Burns realizes that his team was out-hit, out-skated, and\nout-coached on Monday night.  This was not a loss because of poor goaltending\nor officiating.  This calls for drastic measures ... or tee off is next Monday.\n\n\n-jake.
Roger Maynard shares his views, with the masses, on Bob Gainey\nand life in general:\n \n \n \n \nIt was Bryan Trottier, not Denis Potvin.  It was a vicious\n'boarding' from behind...Trottier was given a major.\n \nBut Roger, what the hell does this have to do with Gainey's skill\nas a hockey player?  If Probert smashes Gilmour's head into the\nboards next week, will that diminish your assessment of Gilmour's\nskills?\n \n \nI would take Fuhr and Sanderson off of the latter.\n \nI think Gainey would be honoured to know that you've included him\non this list.  I also think you have a relatively naive view\nabout what wins a hockey game...pluggers are an integral part of\nany team.  The Selke is designed to acknowledge their\ncontribution...I think that most people understand that it's not\nthe Nobel Prize...so settle down.\n \n \n \n \ncongenially, as always,\n \njd\n \n--\nJames David\ndavid@student.business.uwo.ca
I have to disagree with you on this one.  It is anything BUT common.  In the\n4 or 5 years I have been watching hockey I have NEVER seen this happen EVER.\n\nI am not sure what league you have been watching.  :-)\n\nAnyone else agree with this?
My vote goes to John Vanbiesbrouck.  His mask has a skyline of New York\nCity, and on the sides there are a bunch of bees (Beezer).  It looks\nreally sharp.\n\n--\n    Keith Keller				LET'S GO RANGERS!!!!!\n						LET'S GO QUAKERS!!!!!\n	kkeller@mail.sas.upenn.edu		IVY LEAGUE CHAMPS!!!!
As the Sharks' season came to a close tonight, I will start a series of posts,\ntrying to revisit the players, the trades, the moves, etc., that went through\nfor the Sharks for the past season.  If you are uninterested, since I will\nhave the words SHARKS REVIEW in the subject heading in these postings, you can\nkill them.\n\nI will first try to evaluate how the players did.  These ratings, of course,\nare subject to my own biases, but I hope that I can try to be as objective as\npossible.  I will evalute players who finished the season with the Sharks\nand/or did not play for another NHL team this season.\n\nThus, then, let's go to the goaltenders...\n\n#1	BRIAN HAYWARD		Season:	11th\nAcquired:	'91-92 from Minnesota in dispersal draft\nGrade:		P (D)\n\nIt is sad that his career has to come to this dim an end, a career that\nfeatured sharing three Jennings Trophies (with Patrick Roy, in '87, '88, and\n'89).  It would indeed be unfair for me to do anything but give him a passing\ngrade (and skip the letter grading), but he had simply been awful on ice this\nyear, save for a bright spot or two, and even if he had been healthy, he would\nnot be any more than the 3rd-string goalie.\n\nBut Hayward was a classy individual, who also figured in on the Sharks' first\never victory, the 3rd game of the season last year against the Calgary Flames.\nAs he retires, the fans will remember what a good guy he was.\n\n#30	JEFF HACKETT		Season: 3rd\nAcquired:	'91-92, from N. Y. Islanders in expansion draft\nGrade:		C\n\nHackett, after (deservedly) winning the team MVP honors last season, simply\nwasted the year.  Other than a few good spots (57 saves against Los Angeles,\nalmost-shutout against Tampa Bay, etc.), Hackett, finishing with 85.6% save\npercentage and a 5.28 GAA, watched his status go from the team's #1 goalie to\nbench decoration at the end of the season.  He was expected, early, to carry\nthe team along; instead, he apparently became frustrated, but the an early\ninjury that forced him to miss 12 games may have been a contributing factor,\nbut upon return, he simply wasn't up to the task.  He may not return next\nyear.\n\n#31	WADE FLAHERTY		Season: 1st (still eligible as rookie)\nAcquired:	'91-92, signed as undrafted free agent\nGrade:		I (A-)\n\nIt is pretty hard to evaluate a goaltender on just one game alone, thus the\nincomplete grade, but yet in the one start that he did get (against the Calgary\nFlames), Flaherty was nothing but sharp for at least two periods.  He started\nthe season poorly in Kansas City, but finished strong, prompting the Blades'\nowner Ron Parker to comment that he should be a candidate for the IHL MVP\nhonors.  The upcoming IHL playoffs would be a major challenge for him as he\ntries to make it into the NHL; last year, he was a capable backup for Arturs\nIrbe in the throughout the season and in the Turner Cup playoffs, picking up\nall-star honors along with Irbe; now it's time for him to show that he can\nshare the job with Irbe next year, because with prospects Dan Ryder, Trevor\nRobins, and Scott Cashman coming along, if he doesn't make it next year, he\nmay not ever.\n\n#32	ARTURS IRBE		Season:	1st\nAcquired:	'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft\nGrade:		B+\n\nI may yet be overly critical of Irbe in a year that he clearly established that\nhe's a bona fide NHL goaltender, perhaps a bona fide #1 goaltender.  He has\nprovided most of the little highlight footage that the Sharks team had, getting\nthe team's first ever shut-out against the Los Angeles Kings on December 26.\nHe has been fearless in and out of the net, aggressively playing the puck and\nmaking passes, reminding people of a young Ron Hextall (except, of course, the\ngoonism).  Yet he still needs to develop more consistency, which is hard to do\nwith such a bad defense in front of him, but if the Sharks are to challenge for\na playoff spot next season, Irbe's the key, as he demonstrated in being named\nas a star of the game 13 times in 32 starts.
I haven't seen anyone post this so I will do the honors.\n\nMaine beat LSSU 5-4 in Milwaukee on Saturday night.  It was quite a game.\nMaine stormed to a 2-0 lead in the first and looked like they might run away\nwith it.  Maine's first goal came inside the first thirty seconds of the game.\nLSSU came back at the end of the period to cut the lead to 2-1.\n\nLSSU came out in the second dominating the play particularly along the boards.\nThe play went quickly with the refs running a no-holds-barred type of game.\nLSSU scored three more unanswered goals to lead 4-2 at the end of the second.\nNow it looked like LSSU might just walk away with the game.\n\nCoach Walsh, of Maine, replaced the starting goalie Dunham with Snow, who won\nthe game against Michigan.  Snow proved to be a much more aggressive goalie.\nThe third period, like the second, belonged to the team behind.  Maine scored\nthree unanswered goals in a span of five minutes after the four minute mark.\nThey were all scored by Jim Montgomery, the tournament MVP, and all assisted by\nPaul Kariya.\n\nThe last minute of the game bears highlighting.  The change to Snow also\nproved the difference in the end.  With one minute to go and with the LSSU\ngoalie pulled, Snow dueled with a LSSU forward in a amazing set of moves by\nboth.  Snow won.  It was a great way to end the game.\n\nThis year's three championships games were sold out last year in about one\nmonth.  The Bradley Center holds approximately 17,700.
Just Testing !!!\n	No flames please !
When I left, it was 4-3, Blues with 2:00 to go!  As I predicted in\n"@#$%! I was right in the first place!!!"  Blues in 6!  YES!!!\n\nOf course it's only one game -- that could be the 'Hawks stab in the face to\nwake them up -- that's what playoffs are about, on any given day... :-)
Trashy move from a trashy organization. After the front\noffice stated that nobody would lose their job over the\nSens. poor performance, Bridgeman is gone within 24 hours\nof the teams final game.\n\nYes...I know he screwed up letting the King's grab Loach.\n\nSexton's qualifications (aside from being cheap)??\n\n	- he played some US college hockey,\n	- he's pals with club president Bruce Firestone.\n\nJust the kind of experience you need when trying to build\nan expansion franchise. He'll probably be in the Hall of\nFame next year! :-)\n\nThis continues a tradition of front office gaffs:\n- Paul Anka and the arena deal\n- Denis Potvin and the GM postion\n- Mike Bossy and the scoring coach.\n\nHow do people in Ottawa feel about how the club is being run??
Jesus Christ!!!\n\nThe score is now 6-0. The Pens are beating the shit out of the Devils who\ngave up in the middle of the 2nd period. ESPN does something smart. The\nannouncer states "well folks this game is getting out of hand. Lets go to\nthe Islander/Capitals game." I celebrate as I was actually making progress in\nmy CS homework because I was so bored by the scheduled game.  I tear down and\nthrow on my jersey, Hunter scores I go ape shit 'cause this is the first\ncaps game I've been able to watch all season. And what does ESPN do? they\ngo back to the blowout that NJ hasn't a chance in hell of winning!\n     The period ends and the sportscaster (CAPITOLS JUST TIED IT UP!! YES!!\noops excuse me =) goes into his penguin worship mode (Dont freak pens fans!\nThey are worthy of this! I'm so glad we wont have to play them as much next\nyear!) and here comes the 3rd period...what? its the blowout again. Oh they\nwere just waiting for the Cap/Isles to get out of intermission. Good\nthey've put a close game back on. Wait! WHATS THIS SHIT?!! THEY'RE SHOWING\nTHE BLOWOUT AGAIN!\n\n\nAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG!\n\n(Oh guess what the score is now 7-0 penguins! Switch games you $%&*#@!!!)\n\nHoly shit they're changing games! ITS ABOUT GODDAMNED TIME!! Lets see if\nthey'll stay.\n\nLater\n\nI think this proves by $#%&* point. The Caps game goes into overtime but\n"due to contractual obligations" they have to switch to the fucking baseball.\n(Sorry for my language but im PISSED!) What the hell were they going to do\nif their scheduled game went into overtime? ESPN get your head out of your\nass.
Picture if you will, the Habs going into the last couple minutes of the\ngame, leading 2-0.  The Nords get a power play, pull Hextall, and get\na goal.  Bout a minute later, they get another one.  Then they win in\novertime......\n\nA bad dream?.......\n\nHow's that Red Hot Chili Peppers song go...\n"Give it away,give it away, give it away now...."\n\nOh well.  Suppose I can always watch the Leafs win tomorrow night....\n   (smilies.....)\n\nAm I the only female hockey fan in the world?

Was the ABC coverage of the Kings/Flames game supposed to be the\nway it was shown in BC with CBC overriding the ABC coverage?  When I flipped\nto ABC, it was the same commentators, same commercials even.  My question\nis:  Was this the real ABC coverage or did CBC just "black out" the \nABC coverage for its own?\n\n\n	comment:\n\n	CBC had a great chance for some double headers:  Toronto/Detroit\nand Vancouver/Winnipeg, but today they said that the East gets the Leafs\nand the West get the Vancouver game.  I thought that they would show them\nboth.
I recently bought a pack of prospect hockey cards which had various\nplayers that were coming into the NHL. I got this particular card of\na Russian named Viktor Kozlov. It says "many scouts believe he will\nbe the #1 pick in 1993". Another guy is quoted as saying "He's as \ngood as Mario Lemieux". Anyone know who this guy is?????
Chris Chelios was Montreal's co-captain with Guy Carbonneau when he was traded to Chicago for Denis Savard, and Peter Stastny was captain of the Quebec Nordiques when he was traded to New-Jersey. Also Mark Messier was captain of the Edmonton Oilers when he was traded to New-York. How about Dale Hawerchuk with Winnipeg when he was traded to Buffalo, was he captain too ? I think so. I should not forget Wayne (you know who) when he was traded to L.A. he was captain. Didn't they strip Wendel Clark of his capta\n\n\n\nincy in Toronto ?\n\nJust some updates and thoughts.\n\nCheer...\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDaniel Piche (LMC/U/DET - Design)\nEricsson Communications Inc.\n8400 Decarie Blvd, 1rd floor\nTown of Mont Royal, Quebec.

Look how long the Maple Leafs and Nordiques used similar logic....  Not that\nthey fielded bad teams solely to field bad teams, but the Maple Leafs (and a\ncertain dead man who was in charge) were one of the cheapest teams in the\nhistory of the sport.  Guess what-- they were immensely popular at the\ngate.  The Nordiques have also done well for a team that had missed the\nplayoffs so many years in a row.\n\n\nHa!  Such humor!  They have MAJOR fan problems, namely that on occasion some of\nthem don't make it home from the match!  The soccer fans tend to be fanatical,\nmuch like the Montreal fans who firebomb the players and coaches houses when\nthey play pathetically.\n \n-JPC\n\n--
OK, I'll join in the fun and give my playoff predictions: \n\n1st round: \n----------\n\nPITT vs NYI:  PITT in 4.  \nWASH vs NJD:  WASH in 6. \n\nBOS  vs BUF:  BOS  in 5. \nQUE  vs MON:  MON  in 7. \n\nCHI  vs STL:  CHI in 4. \nDET  vs TOR:  DET in 6. \n\nVAN  vs WIN:  WIN in 6. \nCAL  vs  LA:  CAL in 5. \n\n2nd round: \n----------\n\nPITT vs WASH: PITT in 4. \nBOS  vs MON:  BOS  in 6. \n\nCHI  vs DET:  CHI  in 7. \nWIN  vs CAL:  CAL  in 5. \n\n3rd round: \n----------\n\nPITT vs BOS:  PITT in 5. \nCHI  vs CAL:  CHI  in 5. \n\nFinals:\n------\n\nPITT vs CHI: PITT in 5.
Gee, you'd think Winnipeg would be tops on that list, what with 8 regulars\nbeing European.\n\n\n\nWell, being a Jet fan, I sometimes wish that Bure would get knocked silly\ntoo.  (Nothing serious, just enough to keep him out of a game. :)\n\n\n\nIn most cases, the owners have very little to do with it.  They give their\ngeneral managers one order when it comes to the draft...find me the best\nplayers so that our team will win the Stanley Cup.  Whether that player is\nin Kindersley, Saskatchewan or Chelyabinsk, Russia, if the GM believes him\nto be the better player, the GM should be drafting him.\n\nWhere do you get off calling the NHL THEIR league, when referring to Canadian\nplayers.  It doesn't belong to them, it belongs to the owners.  The owners\ncan do what they want.  While a 'Canadian content' rule might be enforcable\nhere in Canada, there is enough doubt that it would be enforcable in the US\nthat the CFL (sorry for the football reference) didn't even TRY to push their\nimport ratio rule on the Sacromento Goldminers.\n\nIncreasing the competition for the 'elite' positions, in most cases, would\nmake players better anyways.  (Oh yeah, and how many Europeans play at the\nlower levels of professional hockey in North America?  While there are some\nthat play in the AHL, or the IHL where that's an NHL team's primary farm\nclub, you don't hear of many Europeans playing in the CHL, the ECHL, or on\nthe secondary farm teams in the IHL.  (ie. the Jets do have a few Russian\nplayers in Moncton, but I don't believe there are any Europeans in Ft. Wayne.))\nSo with all those teams, there are plenty of positions for hockey players\nin North America.\n\n\nI'm in favour of the NHL being the league for the premier players in the\nworld.  I've grown up with Europeans playing on 'my' team, and some of those\nplayers were the among the best in the world.  From Hedberg, Nilsson, and\nSjoberg, to Sel{nne, Zhamnov, and Olausson, and all those in between and to\ncome, I wouldn't have it any other way.
Are people here stupid or what??? It is a tie breaker, of cause they\nhave to have the same record. How can people be sooooo stuppid to put win as\nfirst in the list for tie breaker??? If it is a tie breaker, how can there be\ndifferent record???? Man, I thought people in this net are good with hockey.\nI might not be great in Math, but tell me how can two teams ahve the same points\nwith different record??? Man...retard!!!!!! Can't believe people actually put\nwin as first in a tie breaker......

You can't.  But good luck trying.
Devallano went earlier and more extensively to the Russian strategy\nthan anyone else...and was the first GM to "waste" high draft choices\non young Russians...Devallano would still be GM but he succombed to\nDemers pleading to make the Oates-Federko et al trade...which is the\ndeal that sealed his fate.\n\nMurray has made some decent trades...no doubt...but these are more\ndue to the stupidity or cheapness of other teams than brilliance on\nhis part...Washington was too cheap to pay Ciccarelli so they\nessentially gave him away...and Carson was really a big anchor to\nthe team, and he was able to sucker a rookie GM to give him Paul\nCoffey for deadweight.\n\nIf Detroit still fails this year because he was one defenseman short...\nthen he will have wasted an opportunity because Manson was available,\nand he was unable to pull the trigger.  It is his judgement that he\nhas enough with what he's got...Yzerman doesn't have that many more\nyears in his prime.
Hi all,\n\nDue to living in the Bay Area, I as unable to see Vancouver's victory over\nthe Jets last night.  I know the score, but that rarely describes the game.\nCould someone please post a brief sonapsis (sp?) of waht happened.  How well\ndid each team play?  Were the cannucks deserving of the victory?\n\nAlso, could some kind soul please email me the end of season, individual\nplayer stats?\n\nGreg
During the Detroit game Mon night there were octopus thrown on\n   the ice what is the meaning or symbolism here?  They used to\n   throw fish on the ice here in Spokane afew years ago. I never \n   knew where this came from.

Hello Hockey fans.\nBonjour tout le monde!\n\nWell, in Salt Lake City this past Sunday, the local ABC station decided not\nto televise the hockey games.  La directrous de programme est la tete de merde!\nAnyway, I have a satellite dish, and a few of my friends from hockey have invited themselves over to watch the games this coming Sunday (25 Apr), and I can\nnot find correct game times.  For the Calgary at LA game I have times showing\neverything from 11:00 AM MDT, to 5:00 PM MDT.\n\nI am not even sure what games are going to be played this coming Sunday, now\nthat ABC has mucked up the schedule.  I think I should be able to\npull in\nthree games (11:00 am, 2:00 pm, and 5:30 pm MDT) off the dish, but I am\nnot sure.\n\nIF anybody has a schedule, pleas emial it to me.  As you can see, I have to\ntelent to get rec.sport.hockey, and it is sometimes difficult to get a link.\n\nThanks in advance\nMerci d'avance\n\nP.S.  Anglais ou francais d'accord.\n\n\nRoland Behunin\n\nbehunin@oodis01.af.mil\nbehunin@oodis01.hill.af.mil
Hmmmmmm. I think I'll let everyone make there own comment on this one.\n\n\n\n\nNeilson and Smith are bad. Kovalev is magical.
But ultimately their hockey philosophies are like night and day...\nKeenan believes in pressuring the opposition and taking the\ninitiative (within the limits of his system)...while Roger\nhas a reactive hockey philosophy...which is why Messier will\nbe able to and has played for Keenan, but thought Roger's way\nwas a sure loser.\n\n\nRoger is a great assistant coach...but considering what must be bad\nblood between Nielson and Messier, it would be a mistake to bring\nhim back even in that role.
At the Lester Patrick Awards lunch, Bill Torrey mentioned that one of his\noptions next season is to be president of the Miami team, with Bob Clarke\nworking for him.  At the same dinner, Clarke said that his worst mistake\nin Philadelphia was letting Mike Keenan go -- in retrospect, almost all\nplayers came realize that Keenan knew what it took to win.  Rumours are\nnow circulating that Keenan will be back with the Flyers.\n\nNick Polano is sick of being a scapegoat for the schedule made for the\nRed Wings; After all, Bryan Murray approved it.\n\nGerry Meehan and John Muckler are worried over the Sabres' prospects;\nAssistant Don Lever says that the Sabres have to get their share now,\nbecause a Quebec dynasty is emerging ...\n\nThe Mighty Ducks have declared that they will not throw money around\nloosely to buy a team.\n\nOilers coach Ted Green remarked that "There some guys around who can\nfill Tie Domi's skates, but none who can fill his helmet."\n\nSenators' Andrew McBain told off a security guard at Chicago Stadium\nwho warned him of the stairs leading down to the locker room; McBain\nmouthed off at him, after all being a seasoned professional ... and\ntumbled down the entire steep flight.\n\ngld
The new name is Florida Panthers.  \nThe panther is an endangered species, mostly located in the Everglades.\nA couple of years ago, there were license plates made with Panthers on\nthem (part of the revenue were to go to some protection fund).\n\nThe name of the new President of the Panthers should be announced today.\n\nAs of yesterday's paper, Huizenga's new hockey team will take the ice at\nthe Miami Arena this fall.  The team has a guaranteed two-year lease with\nthe arena, with four one-year options that could run through 1999.\n\n"It's not our choice", James Blosser, a lawyer and Huizenga Aid said\nabout ruling out the arena as a long term option.  "The NHL told us we \ncan't stay there.  It's not economically feasible."\n\nOne reason is because the Miami Heat basketball team controls skybox\nand advertising revenue at the arena, reducing the hockey team's profit\npotential.\n\nThe hockey team is attracting arena site proposals from Broward, Dade, \nand Palm Beach counties.\n\nA leading site is vacant land near Joe Robbie Stadium, where residents\n10 days ago agreed to drop their opposition to a hockey arena, ending\nan eight-year battle of wills.\n\nCompliments of the News/Sun-Sentinel.\n\nJim G.
I'm totally p*-o'd, too!  Vancouver-Winnipeg is great west-coast hockey -\nfast-paced and loads of talent.  What I've seen so far is hardly\nentertaining, with the exception of the odd shift every now & then (of\ncourse I missed Calgary-LA & Pitts-Jersey...)\n\n\nAmen...\n\n\nThat's cheaper than what I do - PHONE CALLS.  (There must be a better\nsystem - one ring, Adams to Linden, he SCORES; two rings Bure rushes up\nthe ice, he SCORES, etc etc :-))
This is very sad indeed.  My condolences to the Minnesota fans who are\nlosing their team.\n\nI fear that within the next decade or so the only professional sports team\nleft in Pittsburgh will be the Steelers.\n\nWe should always enjoy things when we can.  You never know when they'll\nbe taken away from us.
I am not at all clear about what you are trying to say here.   If  you\nasked  somone,  who  had never heard of hockey before, if LA played in\nthe Smythe division what do you think  that  the  response  would  be?\nWhat  if you asked this person if LA played in the West division?  The\nnaming of  divisions  after  long-dead  entrepreneurs  is  unnecessary\nobfuscation.\n\n\n\nHardly.  The "established" situation existed prior to Smythe,  et  al.\nThe  Stanley  Cup was a challenge trophy up for grabs to whatever team\ncould successfully mount the challenge.  What our  dear  founders  did\nwas formalize the challenge.  They created a closed league, an oligop-\nolistic professional system, in the interests of making money.  Wheth-\ner  or  not  that system has contributed to better hockey is certainly\ndebatable.  We are, however, stuck with their invention and  that  de-\nbate  is  academic.   The  point  to  be made, however, is that people\nplayed hockey and people enjoyed watching hockey  long  before  Smythe\nand his pals showed up.\n\n\nWhat's wrong with best defenceman, period?  Was there  ever  a  better\ndefenceman?   Was  there  ever a better player?  And if you think that\nBruce Norris' contribution was somehow  more  significant  than  Bobby\nOrr's  then,  in the interests of education, why don't you take a poll\nand find out how many people know who Norris was?  But you don't  have\nto, do you?\n\n\nSo you don't feel that you should have to make the effort to  remember\nthat  Vancouver  plays in the West division?  (Or Pacific, or whatever\nother intuitively understandable moniker is chosen.)\n\n\n\nAnd of course you neatly deleted Jason's  jingoistic  rant  about  the\ngame  losing  its  "Canadianization".   Quoting me out of context does\nmore to erode your credibility than it  does  mine.   My  position  is\nclearly  progressive  and  is anything but "biased, closed minded, ig-\nnorant".  Arrogant, I will grant you.\n\n\nNice try John.  But for a flame to be truly effective you have to\ndisplay  at  least  enough  intelligence  to  earn  your target's\nrespect.\n\ncordially, as always,\n\nrm
Yes, Colin... I have to agree with you here...  I've put the puck in\nmy own net the same way Smith did... (only once, mind you :-) and it\nwas definitely my fault.  It is NOT a common play to play the puck the\nway that Smith did.  \n\nLuckily, for me...  when I did it... it was only a scrimmage :-)
Before I begin lambasting Don Cherry, let me first say that I've been sort of\na Cherry fan for a while...admittedly stuff he says has to be taken lightly,\nbut he's more-or-less harmless.  On Saturday, however, he crossed the lines of\ngood taste:\n\n\nThis is the best he can do?!!  Gee Don, tremendous amounts of professionalism\nhere.  The CBC looks just as bad as he looks foolish letting him get away with\nthis nonsense...making fun of names??  It's bad enough that he makes asinine\nblanket statements about European players, but he's now resorted to making fun\nof their names too?  He sounded like an idiot, much like he did last week\nwhen he said that Teemu would never make it to his 'Rock 'em, Sock 'em' video\nuntil he dropped the gloves...\n\n\nWell, what he _said_ was that even though he's been around the league for quite\nsome time, he still doesn't know who's where w.r.t. conference and division\nnames.  HELLO??!! McFly??  The names have been around for a couple of decades\nor so....he also invited the audience to "Name the teams in the Wales...quick,\nquick!" Followed by "Ah, you don't know, I don't know...."  \n\nSorry Don.  Wrong on this one.\n\n\nThis was absolutely hilarious.\n\nDon's argument about the basketball and baseball brawls was fairly\ngood...unfortunately he neglected to mention the fines that were levelled in\nthe NBA case.  Serious money...oh well, he's never been one for objectivity,\nhas he?\n\nDon's question to Gretzky:
: \n: And, while we are on the subject, has a captain ever been traded, \n: resigned, or been striped of his title during the season? Any other \n: team captain trivia would be appreciated.\n: \n\nLuc Robitaille was captain of the Kings the first third of the season,\nuntil The Great One came back from his disc injury. It was kind of\nawkward, but Melrose appointed (anointed?) TGO as captain immediately upon\nhis return, after which he did not score a goal for something like 10\ngames.\n\nI think Luc should have remained Captain all season.
The subject line says it all.  Is it terribly difficult to get tickets\nto Penguins games, especially now that they are in the playoffs?  Would\nit be easy to find scalpers outside of the Igloo selling tickets?
Well, I gotta tell ya,\n\nlast night's Leafs game vs the Devils was a nail-bitter LET ME TELL YOU!\nIt was a well played game by BOTH teams (I thought) but according to the\nDon and Ron it was the an "off-night" for the Leafs and the Devils \nwere outplaying Toronto. Well, I BEG to differ....\n\nIMHO, Clark deserved to be a first star as much as Gilmour did. His\nfast breaks towards the net and the good opportunites that he\ncreated reminded me of the Clark of old. (But not to take any of the\ncredit away from Gilmour).\n\nI think the Leafs are playing GREAT hockey. WHY? \nWell first look at their injury list which includes, Cullen, Ellet,\nZezel, Macoun. Of course my question is this....how will the Leafs\nfare when they are once again "healthy" if they are playing this well\nso far??\n\nSecond, just look at their standings, still second in defence,\nmoved from 11th overall to 6th over in the last month, haven't lost\nat home in last 12 games, 8 game undefeated streak..etc.\n(BTW, am I wrong or was this Potvin's first shut-out? I can't \nremember him having any as of yet.)\n\nWell, as of April 3 we see that the race for first in the Norris\nhas truly begun and it will be a VERY CLOSE race between Chicago and\nToronto. And the best game of the season will probably be their last\nagainst each other. (is anyone lucky enough to have tickets to\nsee this one?)\n\nComing to the stretch and still a ROAR'IN!!!!!\nGo LEAFS Go!!!!
Well put, Jason.  I am not from Wisconsin, but I have close relatives who\nlive in Port Washington (about 30 minutes north of Milwaukee), I visit the\ncity regularly, and I have been in the Bradley four times to see the Admirals\nplay  and the NCAA Hockey Championships.  It is a beautiful building.  The\nPettits and the city like to promote it as the best facility for hockey in\nNorth America.\nAs to what will happen with the Admirals if Milwaukee does acquire a\nfranchise, word is the team will move to Green Bay and play in the Brown\nCounty Arena.\nOnce again, the Admirals are an independent franchise, and the people of\nMilwaukee have been supporting them well.  The games I have been to have seen\ncrowds anywhere from 10,000 to 13,000, which are numbers some NHL teams (i.e.\nthe Islanders, Hartford, New Jersey) would be envious of having on some nights.\nPlus the fact that the city is able to support a minor league franchise without\nthe glamour of having an NHL club affiliated to it is testimony to the amount\nof hockey interest exists in the city.\n\nSincerely,\n\nMartin Hill, Rt. 2, Box 155B, Sault Ste. Marie, MI (Home of LSSU:  Go Lakers!)
Francis got 101 in 89-90, his last full season with Hartford.
Well, it's not that bad. But I am still pretty pissed of at the\nlocal ABC coverage. They cut off the first half hour of coverage by playing\nDavid Brinkley at 12:30 instead of an earlier time slot. I don't\neven understand their problem. If they didnt think enough people would\n\nnot watch the game why would they decide to show most of the game? And\nif they showed the remaining 2.5 hours of the game, would it hurt to play\nDavid Brinkley at its regular time? They dont have any decent programming\nbefore noon anyway. I called the sports dept and blasted them on their\nmachine. I called gain and someone picked it up. When I asked him why they\npremepted the first half hour of the Stanley Cup playoffs, he seemed a bit\nconfused. When I explained a bit more in detail, he then said that's upto\nto our programming dept. call back on  Monday. weel, I understand that the\nsports dept is not responsible for this preemption. BUt I can't understand\nhow someone in the sports dept. can't even recognise the name of playoffs\nshown on the very same station he works for.\n\nAnyway, I am going to call them tomorrow and blast them on the phone again.\nI urge all Atlanta hockey fans to call WSB 2 and ask them not to do the\nsame thing for the next 4 weeks.
I think you missed one of my points there.  It takes *more* than a great\nGM to win a stanley cup, even once.  Some of the guys on the list you\ngave earlier never won one.  I agree that you and I could probably argue\nback and forth for days to no avail about who is the best GM in hockey-\nthat is a matter of opinion, and who is to say my opinion is any better \nthan yours or yours than mine?  But the point of my *original* original\npost (if not well stated) was that Murray has the GM abilities but not\nthe coaching abilities.  Which leads to below:\n\n\nI think at this point there's a personal, emotional element involved here\nwhich transcends Murray's logical thought.  As outsiders, it's fine for \nus to say, "He should hire a different coach."  In fact, he has talked about\ndoing so in the past.  But, the press (here in Detroit, at least) has so\nbuilt up this business about Murray never getting past the second round of\nthe playoffs as a coach, that I think he has taken it upon himself to \nprove to the world that he *is* capable of coaching a team past the second\nround.  He needs to, as the papers say, "get that monkey off his back."\nSo it becomes a matter not of intelligence, but of pride.  Is it foolish\nto let pride stand in the way of sound logic?  Perhaps, but we're all\na little that way from time to time.  I think eventually he'll step down\nfrom behind the bench and concentrate on his GM duties, and the team will\nimprove as a result.\n\nI think his coaching duties take away time he might have otherwise spent\non GM work.  In that sense, once he steps down as coach, we'll see how\ngood of a GM he really is.\n\n\nI may not agree with everything you've said, but it's been fun discussing\nit with you.
MIGHTY ONES GET MIGHTIER:\n\nTPS, the Finnish Champions 1992/3, are getting still stronger!\n\nI just heard some news, according to which TPS has acquired\nthe next Finnish hockey superstar(??) Jere Lehtinen from Kiekko-Espoo!\n\nThere are also some rumours about Erik Kakko (Reipas) and Marko Jantunen\n(KalPa) being traded to TPS. Both of this players are currently on the\nFinnish olympic team. I think that Jantunen is drafted to the NHL, too.\n\nBTW. Is Juha Yl|nen (centre, HPK) drafted by the Jets?? During last year\nhe has reached the top level among Finnish centres. He had very good\nplayoff games against TPS!\n\n  Hannu
