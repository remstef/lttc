morgan and guzman will have era's 1 run higher than last year, and\n the cubs will be idiots and not pitch harkey as much as hibbard.\n castillo won't be good (i think he's a stud pitcher)
Um, the header said *career.*  Hodapp managed about 3000 PA in his\nnine years in the majors.\n\nAs for his "consistently over .300," make that "three years in a row, \npreceded by a part-time year, plus his last year, with Boston."  Hodapp\nonly qualified for the batting title five times.  \n\nWas he injured?  He retired right around his 28th birthday.\n\nAnyway, Hodapp put up flashy numbers the year *everybody* put up\nflashy numbers.  That was his only really good year with a bat; \nhis other .300 years were marred by a lack of power and an inability\nto draw walks.  Only 163 of those 3000 PA were bases on balls, which\ndoes not describe a feared hitter.  \n\nOn the other hand, he was part of the long line of famous Cleveland 2B:\nWambsganss, Riggs Stephenson, etc.
I'm from Dallas, and you have alot of nerve saying that WFAN has a bunch of \nHoodlum Mets fans.  During the football season, the local cowboy station here \nhad the WIP on several times for simultanious broadcasts.  I have never heard  \na bigger bunch of low intellect, bed wetting ,obnoxious, woofing, cranial \ndeformed, assholes in my entire life!  The IQ of the average eagles fan must \nbe in the 10-15 range at best, and they have been known to be big droolers.\n\n(Please no flames) ... <let's see if it works for me Bob>  ;-)
I am interested in uncovering statistics on Boston Red Sox players from\nMarch 1992 - present.  I want to look at changes in batting average, hits,\nmulti-hit games, runs, stolen bases, and on base % during\nevery game.  Where can\nI find this information?  Do any sports magazines log this info or do I\nhave to go directly to the ball club?\nThanks for the info.  Kip
But,\n THEY FACED THE PHILLIES -- A TEAM THAT GOT OFF TO AN 8-1 START.\n\n\n\n\n  To be honest, I think the city of Houston loves the new owner.  He has\nbrought baseball back to Houston with key acquisitions -- players that\nwere from the Houston area and wanted to play for the Astros.  I don't\nthink that too many people are fearful that McLane will meddle in the team\nas he has already admitted that he doesn't know a whole lot about baseball.\nMcLane is a businessman, and doesn't like excuses.  He makes a valid point\nthat injuries shouldn't be an excuse to this club.  Look at the depth of the\nbench this season.. Canadele can play 7 positions; Bass and James are solid\noutfielders and can hit well too; Uribe is nice to have as well..  The\npitching staff has 6 legitimate starters.  We're dealing with a young\nHouston team, so injuries shouldn't play a big role.  The only threat is\nthe bullpen -- if Jonesy goes out, we may be in trouble but with the\ntype of starters we have this season, there is less pressure on the pen.
Stankiewicz?  I doubt it.\n\nKoufax was one of two Jewish HOFs: the other is Hank Greenberg.\n\nOther good players: Buddy Myer, Johnny Kling, Norm and Larry Sherry,\nKen Holtzman, Saul Rogovin, Ed Reulbach.  \n\nThere have been over 150 Jewish major leaguers.  A few years ago there\nwas an article about someone who keeps track of this in Spy magazine;\nthe article was entitled "Jews on First," of course.\n\nThere have also been at least two books on the subject.
Clemens is going on his normal four days' rest (last pitched Saturday). \nHesketh only pitched one inning yesterday afternoon, his first outing\nsince an aborted 1-1/3 inning start 6 days before, so he should be plenty\nrested to go in his expected turn this Saturday, as the 5th starter.  Not\nthat this is a good thing, of course.  I'd like to see a well-managed\nfour-man rotation with this team... \n\n---\nGlenn Waugaman\nDigital Equipment Corporation\nLittleton, MA\ng_waugaman@nac.enet.dec.com
So what does that have to do with RBI's?  The team with the most RBI's\ndoesn't necessarily win the game.\n\nYes, runs are the most important statistice -- for a *team*.  (So why does\nevery newspaper rank team offense by batting average?)\n\nBut for an individual player, runs and RBIs are context-dependent, and tell\nus very little about the player himself, and more about his teammates and\nposition in the batting order.
For that matter, how many Gentleman of The Press Box have been Jewish? The\nonly Jewish sportscaster that comes to mind is Steve Williams (?), who had\na Phillies show on KYW in Philadelphia in the 80s.
April 1, 1993\n\n\nI am participating in an NL-league that uses standard Rotisserie rules\nexcept that the following catagories are used:\n\nFor position players:\n	lowest batting average\n	strike-outs\n	caught-stealing\n	errors\n\nFor pitchers:\n	losses\n	blown saves\n	higest ERA\n	'taters allowed\n\nThis is the fifth year that I've participated in this Blowtisserie\nleague.  Last year I won the pennant due primarily to the fact that\nI had terrible pitching.  I would like to lower my batting average\nwhich is rather high because I do have Jose Offerman (who made up\nfor this by helping me lock first place in errors).  Anyway,\nsomeone offered:\n\nAndres Gallaraga for Bud Black\n\nI can afford to give up Bud Black because I still have Kyle Abbott.\nHowever, I am afraid of Andres actually doing well this season.\nShould I make the trade or not?\n\nYour comments will be appreciated.\n\n-- \nWarren Usui
I've been saying that for at least 2 years now and even the A's conditioning\nguru told Jose he was carrying too much weight and losing some would help\nhis back.Although I don't for one second believe Jose used steroids,his\nback problems are very similar to problems alot of steroid users experience\nbecause they are simply carrying too much weight on their frame(see Jeff\nBregel ex 49er as a textbook example), and IMHO Jose is too big for his\nframe.\n\n\n\nI can't imagine how to estimate bat speed, but its pretty obvious that\nJose is missing fastballs he used to hit, likely due to his back.\n\n\n\nI don't know, he had an even more open stance when he first came up with\nthe A's, and had no problems with it then. It might be that pre-back\nproblems, he was quick enough to cover up any deficiencies the stance\ncaused, but now he's lost just enough bat speed that the stance hurts\nhim. The old saying if you're hot its a trigger mechanism, if you're\ncold, its a hitch. \n\n\nThe biggest problem IMHO is he never has found a stance he's comfortable\nwith for more than a few months. He changes his stance so much, he loses\ntrack of where the strike zone is. In Wednesday's night game, he was \nclearly mad at strike calls on both corners that looked pretty good to\nme. I think he no longer knows where the strike zone really is because\nhe's changed his stance so much.\n\nI'm also a bit concerned that because he's got Palmer and Gonzalez hitting\nall the homeruns, he'll become competitive, swing even harder and screw\nhimself up even worse. LaRussa always said that Canseco's famous batting\npractice homer shows did him more harm than good as they encouraged\nbad hitting habits.
I wish I hadn't sold my copy of Jewish Baseball Stars.  It's a Short Shelf\n(i.e., the one on top of the toilet tank) Special.  The writing in that \nbooks is so astonishingly awful -- every sportswriting cliche taken to\nthe nth degree and then mangled -- that it's funny.\n\nRusinow is the author, I think.
^^^^^^\nNo argument at all with Murphy.  He scared the hell out of me when he came in\nlast year.  On the other hand, the club though enough of Boever to put him into\nan awful lot of games (he may have led the league in appearances - he did at\nleast at some point).  He seemed to be a very viable setup guy - but I guess\nthat's not considered that crucial by the club.  I can just remember two years\nago so well, though...\n...\n\nI'm not that concerned.  Those guys have been relatively consistent over the\nyears and they have no good reasons to decline (no injuries, not old, ...).\nI expect them to come through just fine.  It's those guys that have not\nbeen consistently good that are the worrisome part, even if they are coming\nthrough right now.\n\nThis sounds like their old road unis.  Pretty dull.  Buttons or pullovers?\nI'll check through my uniform book to see if they've always had some orange.\n\n\nWell, we'll see.  I've got a Astros pullover shirt with the "Astros stripes"\nacross the shoulders and I have trouble making myself wear it in public.  i\ncan see why they might want that to change.  Gee, if they eliminate the\norange, will they reupholster the seats in the Astros stripes section (what\nused to be the gold and yellow levels - I don't know those numbers they use\nnow).\n\nI saw a pinstripe version of an Astros cap and I actually thought it looked \ngood!
This just in...\n\nNolan Ryan hurt his right knee in the 4th inning of the Rangers-Orioles\ngame last night.  He'll be having arthoscopic surgery that will, at best,\nkeep him on the DL for two to five weeks.\n\nJust when I had almost convinced myself that the Rangers' rotation would\nstay healthy this year...
: I believe that Rusty Staub was also a jewish ball-player\n: Also, Mordaci Brown back in the early 20th century.  He was a pitcher whose\n: nickname was "3 fingers" Brown....for obvious reasons....he had 3 fingers.\n\n0 for 2, ma_ind25.\n\nDaniel Patrick Staub is a Catholic school kid from Nawlins, Mordecai\nBrown a farm kid (probably Protestant) from somewhere in the Midwest.\nHe lost those fingers in a farm machinery accident.\n\nJim Palmer isn't Jewish himself, but Mr. Jockey Shorts's adoptive \nparents are.\n\nAlso, I'm not absolutely certain that Carew actually converted.  His\nwife and children certainly are Jewish.\n\n--
On two separate occasions I saw Dick Allen (back when he was Richie)\nhomer at Shea off the middle of the black centerfield hitter's\nbackground screen.  I think both shots would have traveled 500 feet.
There is NO TEAM, repeat, NO TEAM, that is America's team.  This is a diverse\ncountry with 26 MLB teams (+2 up north) and there is no one team that is\nAmerica's.  Who would the other teams belong to?\n\nAnd how does it happen?  Well, teams receive this monicker through success\n(Cowboys), national exposure (Cubs), or both (Braves).  It spreas aby\nsuccessful advertising campaigns.  Harry Caray, Ted Turner, amd other dupe\npeople into thinking that their representative teams are "hip" so that people\nwill watch them on TV and buy their products.  Arrogant local fans adapt the\nmonicker and think that "their" team is the one that America idolize
I think the next time I post something like this, I obviously need to make\nthe sarcasm a bit more obvious...\n\n\nchuck
Went to the Dodgers game tonight -- it was cap night.\n \nAstacio pitched ok, but had control trouble all night.\nIn the first, he walked a batter, balked him to second, then\na single scored the run, with the batter taking second on the\nthrow home.  Another single made the score 2-0 Cards.\n \nLasorda tried a new line up featuring Butler, Reed, And Piazza\nbatting third!  Darryl and Eric were benched in favor of Snyder\nand Webster.\n \nPiazza homered in the first to make the score 2-1 Cards.\nThe Dodgers tied the game in the second on a two out single\nby Offerman.\n \nBy the fourth inning, Astacio had already made about 80 pitches, but\nthe score was still 2-2.  The Dodger defense made SEVERAL impressive\nplays.  Piazza looked GREAT behind the plate, gunning down a runner\ntrying to steal second, throwing a runner out at first who\nhad strayed a bit from first base, etc.\n \nKarros also made a spectacular play, keeping a ball from going into\nthe outfield.  The runner on first was so sure that ball was going\nthrough, he just kept running past second.  Karros got up and threw\nto third and EASILY got the runner at third.\n \nMy heart sank in the 7th when Gross got up to warm up in the bullpen.\n \nAstacio was lifted for a pinch hitter, and when Gross entered the game\nwith the score still 2-2, Dodger fans just KNEW it was over.\n \nGross was relieving because he stunk on Tuesday, pitching just 2 1/3\ninnings, forcing Lasorda to use much of his bullpen.  The 15 inning\ngame had the same effect the next night...so only Gross was fresh\ngiven his light work out Tuesday.\n \nGross lived up to his name.  He walked the first batter, gave up a hit\nto the second, and walked the bases loaded.  After a grounder resulted\nin a force at home, Zeile lifted a scoring fly ball to make it\n3-2 Cards.  Gross paid little attention to the runners, and the next\nthing you knew, the Cards had stolen a fourth run.  The runner on\nfirst was eventually tagged out in the run down, but the 4th run had\nscored long before that.\n \nMeanwhile, the Dodgers mounted little offense after the second inning.\nLee Smith pitched the ninth.  He had little trouble getting Karros\nand Wallach (does anyone have trouble with Wallach these days?).\nCory Snyder collected his first hit as a Dodger, a single, but\nthat was all the offense the Dodgers could mount.  Smith got his\nthird straight save against the Dodgers and all I got was my\nfree Dodger cap and a good look at Piazza.  If Piazza keeps this\nup all year, he will be a strong candidate for rookie of the year\nhonors.  Though its really early, Karros is already showing signs\nof a sophomore jinx year.\n \nThe final score...Cardinals 4 runs on 7 hits.\nDodgers 2 runs on 7 hits.
Tigers' manager Sparky Anderson gets his 2,000th career win as moments ago,\nthe Tigers completed a two game sweep over the Oakland A's at Tiger Stadium\nby beating the A's 3-2. Here are the highlights:\n\n\n				R    H   E    \n             Oakland		2    9   0\n	     Detroit            3    7   1\n\nChad Krueter scored Skeeter Barnes from 1st with an RBI double in the \nbottom of the ninth against none other than Dennis Eckersley to give the\nTigers the victory.  Barnes also had an RBI single to score Thurmond to\ntie the score in the ninth, also off Eckersley (sp?).\n\nThe A's got their runs on an RBI single by McGwire in the 1st and a solo\nhomer by Reuben Sierra in the 6th.  Deer doubled home Kirk Gibson in the\n7th for the other Tiger run.\n\nJohn Doherty pitched another strong game for the Tigers, once again lasting\nthrough the seventh inning.  He was relieved by Bolton and then David Haas\nin the 8th, and Haas got the win.  Bobby Witt started for the A's, and was\nreplaced by Honeycutt in the 6th, followed by Goose Gossage in the 8th, and\nfinally Eckersly in the 9th.  Doherty gave up both of the A's runs, while\nWitt gave up the first Tiger run and Eckerseley gave up the last two.\n\nIn the post game interview (on WJR radio in Detroit), Sparky Anderson said\nits one of the few times he's gotten emotional in his managing career.  It\nwas a big moment for him, and I'm sure all of us Tiger fans are unanimously\nvery happy for him.  And what a way to get number 2,000!.\n\nConsidering the circumstances, I think it might be appropriate to say:\n\n                WOOF!      Go Tigers!
I hope that this comes off as a somewhat unbiased assesment\nof WFAN and WIP(I go to school in Philadelphia, and I listen to\nboth stations on a consistant basis.)  Now that the fan has Mike\nLupica on from 10 to noon, they have a person who can get the \nbig name guests for interviews, and not just of local importance\nHe did have Dave Cheketts and Fred Wilpon on his show, but he \nhad Bob Costas and Magic Johnson on too.  \n  Now here are my opinions of the two stations competing talent:\nMorning show:\n  In my opinion, I think Imus is much better than Bruno, Cataldi, \nand Morganti, even though I would feel different if Morganti\nhad a better crew of people to work with.  To me, WIP tries\nto copy Imus but make it all sports as a theme.  In terms of\nsports, Imus lacks the blanketing of the airwaves, but he\ninterjects humor and politics into his show.\n10 AM to 12 Noon:\n  I think Chuck Cooperstein and Lupica are equal in their\nabilities to host a radio show, but I think Chuck has the\nadvantage over Lupica in terms of dealing with the caller\nwho is asking about who the local team is going to draft\nin the sixth round.  Lupica and the other hosts on FAN get\nbetter interview guests, but I heard the PD of WIP say that\nthey were not interested in interviews with celebrities unless\nit was a major story.\n  I would consider this even because they are two different\nstyles of host.\n\n12 Noon to 2 PM:\n  At this point, I would have to give a big advantage to \nJody McDonald over Len Berman because Lenny has only been\non for a couple of weeks.  I just think JM has the ability\nto transcend the "homer" mentality of the Philadelphia fan\nbase.  This is most evident when the IGGLES(Philadelphia \nspelling) play the Cowboys because JM is a huge Dallas fan.\nWhere else can you have people call up and predict a 93-0\nscore without the egging of the hosts(re:WIP morning 'guys')\nI do agree that JM was great on the FAN weekend overnight\nand I miss hearing him over the current crop of rotating\nhosts.  I feel that JM is the best sportstalk host on \neither station by a good margin.  If you are in NY and\nyou can't get WIP, JM does fill in on the weekends sometimes.\n\n2PM to 4PM:\n  This is the time when JM goes up against Francesa and \nRusso(fatso and froot loops) and I become the most divided\nin my loyalties.  Mike and the dog are very entertaining,\nbut they often go an hour or so without calls or even 10\nto 20 minutes without talking about sports.  MATD do\nget great guests and that is the basis for their show, so\nit is like the 10 to 12 debate.  Another plus is the\nappearances by Mike and Chris on Imus in the Morning, which\nare often hilarious.  \n\n4 PM to 7 PM:\n  MATD go up against Fredericks and Missanelli.  I like\nMike Missanelli but I just can't stomach Steve Fredericks.  \nI know that SF came from Philly originally, but when he\nwas at the FAN, he was a NY homer as much as he is a Philly\nhomer now.  I don't listen to WIP much after 4 PM unless there\nis a game on that night, but you will see later for the \nreason.  That is why I give the advantage to FAN.\n\n7 PM to Midnight:\n  S&M are on WIP until 8 and then it is the man who makes\nEli that calls MATD all the time seem like a novice on\ncharges of racism, G Cobb.  This man is so grating on my\nnerves that if I listen to him for a few minutes I go\nnuts.(I know that is biased, but listen to his show)\nOn FAN, there is usually a game on, Knicks, Rangers, Mets\nJets, or St. John's basketball.  If the game is on the\nwest coast, then it is usually Howie Rose.  Of course\nI think dead air would be better than G Cobb on WIP, but\nWIP does air Sixers and Flyers games during the season.\n(If this is the sports station, why did they lose the\nIGGLES to WYSP(home of Howard Stern in Phil.))\nDuring the summer, it\nis all talk on WIP.\n\n\nOverall, I would have to give the advantage to WFAN, with\nthe exception of 10 to 12, and 2 to 4 where it is even, and\n12 to 2 where WIP has the advantage.   \n\n\n\n            Rich
No, no no. The Ack man is apparently an alien life-form, much\nlike the pod people from planet Mars, who can take on any form (the\nability remains the same, however). The Ack-people have been spotted on\nmany teams to date, but it appears that the Orioles staff (mentioned\nabove) and the Expos bullpen (Barnes, Walton, Fassero, Gardiner and\nRojas) have been the prime target. Apparently John Wetteland was roughed\nup by the Ack-people during spring training due to the fact that his\nsystem rejected the takeover, and has been on the DL ever since. Contact\nthe authorities! This evil plot must be stopped! (the Ack-people can\nkeep Jack Morris and Juan Guzman, though.

Just a little something I found while reading the Village Voice, which\nis not noted for its sports coverage, but occasionally the print some\ninteresting features.

i'm telling you, sam, three l's.  call up mom and ask.
Most of the points you made about Lopez v. Berryhill/Olson have been\nmade by others, and realizing that Lopez must be the second coming of\nFrank Thomas, I have relented and praised the unmistakeable wisdom of\nhis supporters.\n\n\nSee?  This is essentially what everyone was doing  -  comparing Lopez\nto one of the best players in the game.  I'm really looking forward\nto seeing this can't-miss superstar now.  As for Thomas, I remember\nbeing an advocate of his being brought up in 1990 even though he was\nonly 21 or 22 (can't remember).  But who did the Sox have at first?\nCalderon?  Martinez?  Kittle?  The spot was there.  The talent was\nthere.  Sure, I say go for it.\n\nI am not convinced that Lopez is anywhere near as talented as Thomas\nwas after his AA season in 1989, and I am not convinced that Olson/\nBerryhill are nearly as bad as Kittle/Martinez were.\n\nBTW, I don't think Thomas was hurt by those three months.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWell, if we can't compare our guy to one of the best in the game,\nlet's compare our decision to one of the most "Boneshead", right?\n\nCal Eldred was 24 when he came up, with a full season at AAA and a\nlonger minor league career.  Frankly, I don't know why he didn't\nmake the club in 1992.  Bones is a year younger with a lousy prior\nhistory, and just watching him makes me think that I missed a \ncareer as a big-league pitcher.  No one -  I repeat NO ONE  -\nlaughed louder than I did at the Sheffield trade.  (Though I guess\nMieske has a future.)\n\n(I take it back. McIlvaine may have laughed louder.)\n\n\n\n\naw, gee, shucks.  thanks guy.  except I missed the part where SDCN's\nadmit they're wrong.\n\n\n\n--	The Beastmaster

The other Jewish HOF'er is Rod Carew (who converted).  \n\nLowenstein is Jewish, as well as Montana's only representative to the\nmajor leagues.\n\nUndeserving Cy Young award winner Steve Stone is Jewish.  Between Stone,\nKoufax, Ken Holtzman (? might have the wrong pitcher, I'm thinking of the\none who threw a no-hitter in both the AL and NL), and Big Ed Reulbach,\nthat's quite a starting rotation.  Moe Berg can catch.  Harry Steinfeldt,\nthe 3b in the Tinkers-Evers-Chance infield.\n\nIs Stanky Jewish?  Or is that just a "Dave Cohen" kinda misinterpretation?\nWhatever, doesn't look like he stuck around the majors too long.
I'm still catching up from Spring Break, but bear with me...\n\n\n\nJavy Lopez has proven, over 1400+ AB in the minor leagues, that he is\nready to play in the majors. He is *not* being rushed. Players who are\nclearly too good for AA and play behind stiffs at the major league level\nare wasting their time, and may actually have a court case against\nmajor league management for keeping them, at AAA.\n\n\nUnless Lopez is *me* defensively (I'm 5'7'', 165 and born to play\nsecond base :-)), he belongs in the major leagues.\n\n\nValentine isn't saying he should back up. He's saying he should be put\nin a position to *win* the job in the major leagues, which, IMHO, he\nwould if given the opportunity. (Val, if I'm misinterpreting, please\nlet me know.)\n\n\n\nBut the players who *are* ready are 1)the best and 2) the ones most\nlikely to benefit from being in the majors. Javy Lopez is not a middle-\nof-the-road prospect. He's the real thing. NOW. \n\nAgain, the most important thing a player can do is hit. Lopez does that\nmiles better than Olson or Berryhill. If his defense is good enough for\nGreenville, or Richmond, it's good enough for Atlanta. If he really was\nawful defensively, he would no longer be a catcher. See Sprague, Ed.\n\n\nOh, where to start... OK. First of all, solid != good. I want good players.\nSolid is one of those words used to describe nice white guys who really\naren't very good at baseball. Think of it as "TWG" without the caps.\nIt's a losing strategy to say, "We have solid guys, we don't need to improve."\nYou used it four times in that paragraph, BTW.\n\nSame for experienced. I might add, though, that Greg Olson and Damon\nBerryhill aren't exactly Carter and Fisk. Olson has played three years,\nBerryhill five, although 90 and 91 were a wash. The only difference,\nIMHO, between Olson and Valle is the supporting cast.\n\n"Two big bats." Hrm. I like Justice, but I find Mr. Gant's trend disturbing.\nCall it one and a maybe. The Braves' platoon is OK, but neither player\nhas *any* value outside of the platoon. Bream vs. LH and Hunter vs. RH\nare awful. I'll leave the thirdbase comment alone. Pendleton has wasted\ntoo much bandwidth already. If the CF platoon hits .300, I'll retrace\nMr. Likhani's midnight run down Forbes, and I live in NY and LA.\n(Got that, Mike?)\n\nAnd doesn't Cox call pitches, anyway?\n\n\nNope. They're baseball management, possible the most short-sighted \ncollection of people in the nation. Do you not believe this goes on,\nMark? Do you think Frank Thomas needed those three months in AAA in\n1990? Or Cal Eldred wasn't *really* better than Ricky Bones last year?\n\n\nYou're mostly polite; make defensible, if flawed cases; have wit and\nhave, in the past, admitted being wrong.

Up to this point, I really thought this had been written by a \npro-SDCN, anti-mediot poster blessed with a certain talent for\nsarcasm and biting remarks.  Somebody like me, for instance.\nThe lurid overstatements were obviously intended to humiliate the\noriginal poster.\n\n\nBut then the scales were lifted from my eyes.  Looks like Robert is\nreally being serious.  Oh, well.\n\nI compare the performance of the 1992 Phillies with the 1987 edition,\nwhich had outstanding run producers at every position except SS, yet\nfinished at a frustrating sub-.500 level.  The 1987 folks didn't \never amount to anything, and neither will the 1992 squad, IMHO.\n\nAny other parallels with previous years' teams for this year's\neditions (in the style of 1993 Braves = 1971 Orioles)?\n-- \nGreg "Mockingbird" Franklin   "Interracial mixing encompasses a lot lot more\nf67709907@ccit.arizona.edu      than mingling between G7 races." -- robohen

Someone in SABR actually looked at these games a few years ago \nand found that the official scorer awarded the save in every one \nof the games - even those in which the pitcher had pitched badly \n(allowing 4 or 5 runs).
I am trying to think how to respond to this without involving personal feeling\nor perceptions and I can not without having stats to back up my points.\nHowever, I think you approached this the wrong way. I believe all of the\npeople mentioned here deserve the hall of fame more than Dave Kingman does. I\nfeel they were all much better players. I am not saying I fell they deserve to\ngo but that they would deserve it more. \n\nIMHO \nDave Kingman - definately not. They guy only had a couple of years were he\ncould hit with atleast a respectable averag. The rest of his career I do not\nthink he was very feared by pitchers. I also do not think he did a lot for the\ngame. I mean really I am a Met fan - he was a Met for part of his career and I\nstill would not back him for the Hall of Fame.\n\nDave Winfield - I think so. He is feared by pitchers, he has had several\nseason where he hit for a respectable average and his production numbers are\n(in my opinion - without stats) better than Kingman's (probably by quite a\nbit). I also perceive him to be a leader, maybe not as much as some other\npeople but none the less a leader. I think he has made substantial\ncontributions to the game of baseball and to society. Examples of this are\nsome of the charitable things he has done (I know some of this from when he\nwas with the Yankees). I think he the type of player that kids can look up to\nand while this is definately not the only criteria for the Hall of Fame I\nthink it deserves some consideration.\n\nLee Smith - Maybe, I would have to see his stats again but he definately would\ndeserve to go before the likes of Kingman.\n\nDarrell Evans - No.\n\nEddie Murray - Maybe, He has had a very good career, he is a leader (although\na silent one), he is a good role model. Are the stats good enough? I am not\nsure - but I would once again believe they are much better than Kingman's both\nthe average as well as the power numbers (but not as good as Winfield's). Just\nthink, Eddie did not have as much publicity for most of his great years.\n\nJeff Reardon - My guess is no, but it kind of depends on his numbers. Off the\ntop of my head I would take Lee Smith first.\n\n\nWell, I strongly disagree here. Both of these guys deserve it for sure. I\ntalked about leadership above, both of these guys are leaders and have been\ninstumental in leading their teams to the post season. Robin does have very\ngood offensive numbers both average and power and Ozzie has okay numbers\noffensively. The difference with Ozzie is that if you gave him a home run for\nevery run he saved by making an incredible play at shortstop - he would have\nshattered Aaron's home run mark by now. How many of those great plays saved\ngames? How many of those great plays motivated his team to rally and win a\ngame? While I believe both of these guys have numbers, baseball is about more\nthan numbers (or at least winning at baseball is about more than numbers).\nBoth of these guys are proven stars and belong in the Hall of Fame. As does\nGeorge Brett who also belongs in this class of player.\n\n\nSteve Garvey - I am not sure, probably not but I guess I could see someone\nmaking a case for him. \n\nJack Morris - Once again not my first choice but I can see why someone might\nbring up his name.\n\nKirby Puckett - Probably. The only reason I do not say definately is he still\nhas time left in his career. If he continues doing what he has been then my\nprobably will turn into a definately.\n\nNolan Ryan - Is there really any doubt? I think I heard something about him\nhaving some 53 records (maybe they were not all good - I don't know I did not\nhear any of them just the number). He has the numbers, he has the\ncontributions to the game and community and he is a great role model. I would\nnot say that he is the best pitcher to ever pitch the game (probably not even\ntop 20) but he would be the first pitcher I would put in the Hall of Fame\nbecause of his accomplishments (no-hitters, strikeouts, respectable numbers -\neven with some weaker teams) you can go on and on. I really hope he gets ALL\nthe possible votes.\n\nSo in summing up I have 3 groups, those that belong, those that probably do\nbut I am not sure and those that I lean towards saying don't belong at least\nnot without my seeing stats and possibly hearing reasons why they should go.\n\nYes -  Winfield, Yount, Brett(not in your mail), O. Smith, Puckett and Ryan\nMaybe - Murray and L. Smith\nNo - Reardon, Garvey, Morris, Evans and definately Kingman\n\nAs I said I do not have the stats around so I do not have numbers to back this\nup - these are entirely my opinions based on my perceptions.
I believe SI had an in-depth article on Moe a while ago. I remember\n	that the article revealed some new facts regarding the secretive\n	Moe. My SI subscription expired this past February, the second of\n	two years that I received same. Therefore my guess is that the\n	article appeared sometime in 1991-92. \n\n	Can anyone else be more definitive as to a date of the SI article ?

This talk about the Phillies winning the NL East is scary.  VERY\nscary!  Don't get me wrong, Im a Phillies fan but as late as last\nyear they looked helpless.  The funny thing was they did have a lot\nof injuries in '92 spring training that basically killed their\nchances.  Of course, don't forget the Dykstra wrist injury in the\nfirst or second game?

I agree.  Home runs off Clemens are always memorable.  Kinda like\neclipses and hurricanes.  They don't happen very often.
My god, hope we don't have to put up with this kind of junk all season!\n\n\nHow many home runs by Tartabull?  Just 1, right, you must be thinking\nof Dean Palmer or Juan Gonzalez (both of Texas) who each had 2 homers.\n\n\nI don't know how many to follow, but he was 1 for 4.
Most of this discussion has been between Mark Singer and David Tate,\nwith Valentine weighing in on the same side as Dave at various times.\nMy opinion, FWIW, to all:\n\nMark, age doesn't matter; ability does. I would rather have the untried\nrookie with great minor league numbers than the veteran who has proven\nhimself to be average at best. I don't care if he is 15; if he plays\nbetter than what I have, I want him out there. Sandy Alomar had decent\nminor league numbers, grossly inflated by the PCL in general and Las\nVegas in particular; he should have been projected as an average major\nleague hitter (which is good for a catcher, I'll admit). Santiago's\nnumbers would probably come out the same as Sandy's, but I don't have\nthe league data from the mid-80s to check it out.\n\nThat being said, I agree with sending Lopez to Richmond, at least to\nstart the season. As the box below shows, he has *one* minor league\nseason in which he hit well. He has two in which he hit very, very\npoorly. I want to see that the 92 Lopez is real. Olson and Berryhill\nare not complete mediocrities; for catchers, especially NL catchers,\nthey are essentially average hitters, with equivalent averages around\n.220. If he had hit well at prior levels, I would say he belongs on\nthe Braves; but there is a reasonable chance that Lopez last year was\njust as much a fluke as Alomar in 90 or Santiago in 87. One year at\nany level, at any age, doesn't satisfy MY standards of evidence.\n\n    JAVIER LOPEZ 1971         \n  1990 BUR    428  101  10   1   9    5    0   1  .179   33  .236  .245  .327\n  1991 DUR    389   84   8   1   9   14    7   2  .175   29  .216  .243  .311\n  1992 GRN    445  135  22   2  14   22    7   2  .271   71  .303  .336  .456\n  1992 ATL     16    6   2   0   0    0    0   0  .306    3  .375  .375  .500\n    MAJ        16    6   2   0   0    0    0   0  .306    3  .375  .375  .500\n    MIN      1262  320  40   4  32   41   14   5  .213  133  .254  .277  .368\n    TOT      1278  326  42   4  32   41   14   5  .214  136  .255  .278  .369\n    MAJ       650  244  81   0   0    0    0   0\n    MIN       630  160  20   2  16   20    7   2\n    TOT       630  161  21   2  16   20    7   2\n\nOn a similar note, I don't understand why more people are not\nsupportive of Neon Deion.

But he\nhas a combined 720 OPS in minor league play; with his speed is more\nvaluable than the OPS alone indicates; and at a still young age (24),\nhad a monster year with an 868 OPS. He has a total, major and minor,\nEQA of .249; above major league average, and above average for CF\n(which was about .240 in the NL last year). He has shown at least the\npotential of going into the .290s, which would make him one of the 15\nbest hitters in the league. He has two full seasons before reaching\nhis "prime" season of 27. He should be considered as a legitimate\nprospect, and not as a simple side-show attraction.\n\n      DEION SANDERS 1968      \n  1988 FLA     21    8   2   0   0    1    1   0  .325    4  .381  .409  .476\n  1988 INT     20    3   1   0   0    1    1   1  .086    0  .150  .190  .200\n  1989 EAS    123   35   1   2   2    9   15   4  .257   19  .285  .333  .374\n  1989 NYY     47   11   1   0   2    3    1   0  .222    6  .234  .280  .383\n  1989 INT    263   70  11   4   6   18   15   6  .246   37  .266  .313  .407\n  1990 NYY    133   21   2   2   3   13    8   2  .161    9  .158  .233  .271\n  1990 INT     85   26   7   1   1   14    8   1  .312   18  .306  .404  .447\n  1991 ATL    110   20   2   1   4   12   10   3  .201   12  .182  .262  .327\n  1991 RIC    129   30   5   2   4    7   11   3  .230   17  .233  .272  .395\n  1992 ATL    306   92  10  12  11   22   24   9  .295   60  .301  .348  .520\n    MAJ       596  144  15  15  20   50   43  14  .245   87  .242  .300  .418\n    MIN       641  172  27   9  13   50   51  15  .252   96  .268  .321  .399\n    TOT      1237  316  42  24  33  100   94  29  .249  182  .255  .311  .408\n    MAJ       600  145  15  15  20   50   43  14\n    MIN       603  162  25   8  12   47   48  14\n    TOT       601  154  20  12  16   49   46  14
This is true, but the main thing the commish i.e. Selig needs to do\nis to suspend Bobby Cox.  You *cannot* allow a team to come out at\nthe ump as the Braves did.  I usually rip umps, but in this case,\nthe players were dead wrong.  Cox should go for 5 games.  If I\nhad ever umped a game where that happened, I'd have ejected every\nplayer that came out.  Only Cox and Gant would have been spared, and\nthen Cox would have gone in the ensuing argument.
After reading my local paper today, I found out that the Phillies\nstarted the 1964 season at 10-2.  I am not as old as 1964, but I've\nheard many talk about the serious choke job the Phillies did that\nseason. They were ahead of the Cardinals by 15 games that season in\nmid-August.  They managed to lose a bunch from then on and the\nCardinals took the division.  15!!! games ahead and lost it.... I\nhope this season is MUCH different.
Ladies and gentleman,\n\n	Step one was taken on the Phils' triumphant trip this year tonight!\n\n			(Yes, that was English!)\n\n	Mulholland's ERA after tonight's game? 0.00...nice try Drabek!
The umps saw the weekend boxscores, too.  They knew the pitchers needed\nsome help or they would be watching the sunrise. :)
Are most players who come up young always good when they're young, or\nlater?\n\n\nDamn.  I was afraid you would say that!\n\n\nWell, perhaps if the Braves had no one else worth playing this year it\nwould be Lopez in there.  But they do have others worth playing, at\nleast in *their* opinion.  And I happen to agree.\n\n\nI can believe that.  I'm a newbie here, so I'll take your word.  But\nAlomar *is* a fine defensive catcher, which was my statement above.\nThat is a solid reason for bringing him up at a tender age, as long\nas they feel he can also hit a bit.  Lopez does not have such a\nconsensus about his defensive prowess, and imho that is enough to\ngive him that dreaded "seasoning".\n\n\nSorry.  New.  Don't know Nichols' Law.  Don't believe in catchers'\nera.  But I am interested in pitchers' eras with different catchers.\nAny info on that?\n\n\nIn other words, we know more than they do, so the only logic behind \na different decision than we would make must be financial.  I presume\nwe feel this way about other franchises than Atlanta, no?\n\n\nWell if it does make organizational sense, one can hardly fault them\nfor their decisions.  I mean, please don't tell me how to run my\nbusiness.  Especially when I'm being successful.\n\n\nI'm sure you could be right.  You could also be smoking some illegal\nsubstance.\n\n(Hey.  That's a joke.  Don't get offended.  Please.)\n\nWell, I can't cite anyone's ethical rectitude because I don't know\nwhat it means.  :)\n\nBut again, if it makes organizational sense, then so be it.  Baseball\nis a business, and if there is a solid business reason for keeping\nLopez on the farm then that's what the Braves *should* do.\n\nI happen to believe that it's a baseball decision.  While you from\nyour armchair may disagee, I don't.  I think there is a lot of\nevidence to suggest the decision they made.  I predicted it among\nlarge guffaws from several at the start of spring training.  I\nthink it is a very *normal* decision to have made.  It is certainly\nmore reversible than to have started Lopez in the bigs and have\nreleased one of their catchers.  Sure, it may be conservative.  It\nmay also be logical.  I don't know what ethics have to do with it.\nSeems like pretty good common sense to me.\n\n--	The Beastmaster

Exchanged one stiff for another, as Berenguer hadn't\ncome back from his injury in 91.  I think he's retired now.\n\nAnyhow, as middle relief, Marvin ain't that bad.  He at least can\npitch a couple of innings or do mop-up work.

But now it all falls apart ...\n\n9/21  0-1   Cincinnati      5 1/2     Mahaffey (12-9)\n            (Reds take sole possesion of 2nd place)\n9/22  2-9   Cincinnati      4 1/2     Short (17-8)\n9/23  4-6   Cincinnati      3 1/2     Bennett (12-13)\n9/24  3-5   Milwaukee       3         Bunning (18-6)\n9/25 5-7/12 Milwaukee       1 1/2     Short; Boozer (3-4)\n            (Cards now 2 1/2 back in 3rd, Giants 3 1/2 in 4th)\n9/26  4-6   Milwaukee         1/2     Mahaffey; Schantz (2-5)\n9/27  8-14  Milwaukee      -1         Bunning (18-7)\n            (Phils lose 7 1/2 games in 7 days; Reds take over 1st,\n             Cardinals 1 1/2 back in 3rd)\n9/28  1-5   St. Louis      -1 1/2     Short(17-9)\n            (Cardinals take over 2nd place, Phils drop to 3rd)\n9/29  2-4   St. Louis      -1 1/2     Bennett (12-14)\n            (Reds and Cardinals now tied for 1st)\n9/30  5-8   St. Louis      -2 1/2     Bunning (18-8)\n            (Cardinals take 1/2 game lead over Reds)\n10/1  4-3   Cincinnati     -1 1/2     Short; Roebuck (5-3)\n            (Phillies halt 10-game losing streak; Cards lead Reds by 1/2 game)\n10/2  Did not play; Cards lose to Mets, Reds tied for 1st, Phils 1 game back\n10/3  10-0  Cincinnati     -1         Bunning (19-8)\n            (Cards beat Mets, take first by 1 from Reds and Phillies)\n\nWhew! what a finish! And the final standings were:\n\n                 W     L    GB\nSt. Louis       93    69    -\nPhiladelphia    92    70    1\nCincinnati      92    70    1\nSan Francisco   90    72    3\n\nNow it doesn't appear to me that Phillies pitchers Bunning and Short\nwere really overused, at least by the four-man rotation standard of\nthe day, until well along into the 10-game losing streak, at which\ntime Mauch was probably desperate for a win at any cost because the\nPhillies substantial lead had evaporated. The way they were used at\nthat time may have made the problem worse, although Bunning had one\nof his sharpest games of the year in the final day 10-0 shutout of\nthe Reds that cost the Reds a share of the pennant. Bunning pitched\na complete game six-hitter, striking out five and walking one. It\nwould be inetersting to see, though, how the total innings for the\nyear for Bunning and Short stacks up against the rest of the league.\nAlso notice that the Phillies played every day from at least September 1\nthrough October 1; while they didn't play substantially more games than\nthe other teams, the other teams each had a couple days off during that\nstretch.
.\n	.\n	.\n\nSince I was born in the late Pleistocene, I too remember 1964.  That year,\nthe Dodgers were several games out of first and I think finished sixth in the\nleague.  This was kind of odd because they won the World Series both the\nprevious year and the following year.\n  \n\n-- \nWarren Usui
Hello\n\nas the subject tells all I am trying to find out what is the formula to\ncalculate the ERA for the pitchers.\n\nIf any of you baseball fans have it please e-mail me at\n\n\n	napoli@atc.olivetti.com\n\n\n	thank you very much
Well, it really isn't this cut and dry, but as a Jay fan the thing I feared\nworst has happened. The Yanks sent down Williams G and are going to start\nWilliams B in CF.\n  I also believe they kept Wickman and Millitello in their rotation, which is\nmuch nicer than that Kaminiecki and Mike Witt combo I thought they'd throw\nout their to the slaughterhouse because of their "experience". Granted, Witt\n"might" be good, but I think that they used rationale to keep the youngsters\nup and not given the job to Witt because he was a good pitcher and has\nexperience.\n  The Yanks are showing that they are taking positive strides forwards; the\nJays with the loss of Dave Stewart are looking at gigantic holes in their\npitching staff.\n  The Orioles should also be there in the end.....
Well, Maddux looked excellent as the Braves shutout the Cubs 1 - 0.\nJustice drove in the only run with an RBI single in the first. Get\nready for him to have a monster year. He is now hitting the ball to\nthe opposite field with a lot of power to go with his natural \npower to right field and his good batting eye. If he stays healthy\nwhich he should (his back is full strength this year) he should\nget over 100 RBI and close to 30 HR.\n\nIn another note, the Marlins got off to a good start beating the\nDodgers. I believe the score was 6 - 3 but I'm not sure. I wish\nthem and the Rockies well this year. Hell. I think it would be\nfunny to watch the Dodgers hit the cellar again this year.
anyone know the outcome of tonight's jays game?\n-home runs?\n-winning pitcher?
[Deletions]\n\nGeez, Dal must have slipped something into Ted's drink sometime.  Comparing\nPrince to Pagnozzi offensively is laughable.  Prince has never hit well in\nthe minors and he's now 27 years old, I think.  Pagnozzi was not a bad hitter\nin the minors.  (I'll bring in the numbers tomorrow assuming I don't have\nanother brain cramp and forget.)  He had a very good year at Louisville \nbefore coming up to the majors.  As I recall, the hype on Pagnozzi coming up\nin the organization was good hit, decent fielding.  When he got to the \nmajors and didn't hit as well as expected (not as much playing time?), he \nbecame Exhibit 312 in Nichols' Law of Catcher Defense and got the reputation \nas an outstanding defensive catcher.  It's not clear he ever learned to\nhit.  His four years with more than 100 AB--\n\nBorn 31 July 1962\nYear     AB      BA     SLG     OBA  \n1988    195    .282    .320    .328\n1990    220    .277    .373    .321\n1991    459    .264    .351    .317\n1992    485    .249    .359    .290 \n\nNo power, less-than-league-average walks, peak year when he turned 28, \nnow declining.  If Ted is going to invoke Pagnozzi as a model for Prince,\ngiven that Prince has underperformed Pagnozzi in the minors, it's not\na rosy picture.\n\nBTW, I'm still unhappy with moving Zeile, who had the same reputation \ncoming up in the Cardinal organization as Pagnozzi, except that he was\na much, much better hitter, to 3rd where he could be an average hitter\nand a below average fielder instead of a well-above average hitter\nas an average (or below average) fielding catcher.\n\nHarold
First game, first at bat.
duh, why not just chop out the .sig?\n\nbob vesterman.\n\nps: hey kids, take all those pictures of dead presidents out of your\nparents' wallets and mail them to:
Foolish me.  And here I thought it had something to do with the \nfact that they were hitting against Wakefield, who had no "kncukle"\nto his ball that day, and Otto, who has no stuff.  I wonder if \nReggie gave the same pep talk and instruction to the rest of the\nlineup, who also suddenly came alive those two games.\n\n\n\n--	The Beastmaster
It depends on which uniforms you are talking about.  For the last\ncouple of years I believe Toronto and Pittsburgh has used the same uniforms,\nor at least very similar.  The home jerseys had the team nick name\n(Blue Jays or Pirates), but the road jerseys had the name of the city\n(Toronto or Pittsburgh).  I believe this is the way most teams design\ntheir uniforms.
Rogers is the "one-batter lefty" in the bullpen.  Dusty has also said he\ntrusts Rogers to get the final out in a ballgame where Beck is\nunavailable, so you might see a couple of saves for Kevin.  Then again, if\nany of the regular rotation falters, Rogers is a possible candidate to\nstart, though this would appear less likely now that Dave Burba did well\nin an emergency start.
: I think most of the problems mainly arose from Manager Gene Mauch's\n: ineptitude in managing the pitching staff.  Down the stretch, he\n: abused Jim Bunning, Chris Short, and Robin Roberts (I think those\n: are the three) pitching each on only 2 days rest for quite some\n: time.  By the time they hit the last 2 weeks of the season,\n: obviously none of these guys had an ounce left in their arm.  Oh\n: well.\n\nRoberts was long gone -- he was probably an Oriole in 1964.  Or maybe a\nColt .45.  The 3rd starter was Art Mahaffey, the previous year's ace.\nDennis Bennett was the 4th starter.\n\nThey were indeed 6.5 up with 12 to go, but they won their final two\ngames after the horrid 10-loss streak.  The final game victory\n(Bunning's 19th win, if memory serves) kept the Reds from tying for the\ntitle; they and the Phils were both 1 game behind the Cards, with the\nGiants(?) another game back.  The Mets couldn't hold an early lead\nagainst the Cards that final Sunday, or there would have been a 3-way\ntie.  Too bad they couldn't have saved some of the 15 or so runs they\nscored on Saturday when they crushed St. Louis.\n--
I thought I'd post my predicted standings since I find those posted by others\nto be interesting.  Sorry this is after Opening Day.  I certify that these\nwere completed before the first pitch. :-)\n\nAL East\n1.  New York Yankees - the most (only?) improved team in this division\n2.  Toronto Blue Jays - Stewart and Morris?  No way.\n3.  Milwaukee Brewers - they always seem to do better than I expect\n4.  Baltimore Orioles - Pitching, but Devareaux, Anderson, and Hoiles will drop\n5.  Cleveland Indians - Still don't seem to know what they are doing\n6.  Detroit Tigers - All key players but Fryman are another year past peak\n7.  Boston Red Sox - Any team with Clemens and Viola might be beter than 7th\n\nAl West - this division was the toughest for me to pick.  Whoever of the top\n          4 gets pitching should win it.\n1.  Minnesota Twins - young pitchers seem to have best chance for success\n2.  Texas Rangers - I don't know why I have them here.  Jose Canseco?\n3.  Chicago White Sox - Frank Thomas but no pitching.\n4.  Oakland A's - LaRussa is the best manager and would keep any team close\n5.  Seattle Mariners - I like Pinella, but don't see much here\n6.  Kansas City Royals - will score no runs\n7.  California Angels - will win no games\n\nNL East\n1.  Montreal Expos - good all around, plus no Wallach!\n2.  St. Louis Cardinals - (Jeffries + Whiten) >> (Jose + Clark), no Galarraga\n3.  Pittsburgh Pirates - youngsters will take up more slack than expected\n4.  New York Mets - some good players, still not a "team"\n5.  Philadelphia Phillies - they don't impress me\n6.  Florida Marlins - they know what they're doing\n7.  Chicago Cubs - they don't know what they're doing\n\nNL West - The 2 best teams in baseball are in this division.\n1.  Atlanta Braves - Awesome starters, but offense could be a concern\n2.  Cincinnati Reds - Would not surprise me if they won it all\n3.  Houston Astros - Any team that signs Uribe won't contend. Closer to 4 than 2\n4.  San Diego Padres - Plantier could be the Sheffield of 1993\n5.  Los Angeles Dodgers - better pitching than the Giants\n6.  San Francisco Giants - because the Rockies just stink\n7.  Colorado Rockies - will become the Seattle Mariners of the NL.\n\n\nNLCS  Montreal d. Atlanta  (Braves fans, yes I'm probably contradicting\n                            what I said in my NL West comment.)\nALCS  New York d. Minnesota\n\nWorld Series  New York d. Montreal - Hating the Yankees will be\n                                     fashionable again\n\nNL MVP:  Barry Bonds, or maybe McGriff\nNL Cy Young:  Jose Rijo\nAL MVP:  Frank Thomas will deserve it (again), but Fielder might win it\nAL Cy Young:  Roger Clemens (at least will deserve it (again))\n\n--
So far Simmons looks like a total idiot.\n\n\n1) Zane Smith should learn how to "switchpitch" and return from the DL. I\nwould rather have Zane Smith pitch right handed than have Moeller pitch at all.\n\n2) I am sure Simmons was ready to say I told you so after Otto had an\nimpressive win last week. NOw Otto's latest debacle has restored Simmon's\nreputation. Now he looks like he is back in his '92 form when he had the\nAL's highest ERA among starters. Four our sake(not Ted's sake), I hope he\npitches with a 3.5 ERA for the rest of the season. Yeah, right.\n\n3) Tomlin and Merced are a bit disappointing. They are still doing decently.\nBUt considering the considerable amount of talent and maturity they have\nshown their first seasons, they seem to have actually gotten a little\nbit worse. Tomlin was almost unhittable his rookie year against lefty batters.\nMerced had a very good OBA his rookie year. He showed a lot of concentration at\nthe plate in his rookie year.\n\n4) Walk: Well, he seems to be on the losing end tonight. BUt I still think that\nWalk desrved his contract.\n\n5) Leyland should accept a part of the blame for the LaValliere situation. I\ncan't understand his and management's fear of losing Tom Prince through\nwaivers. Even if they do, what's the use. He is aright hander like Slaught.\nNot a very smart platoon. Also, I am blaming Leyland in this case, since he is hcurrently    convinced that LaVAlliere is through, while giving him\nway too much time last year in the regular season AND the playoffs(SLaught\nshould have played in all 7 games; he has a good average against right handed\npitching). Didn't Leyland and Simmons forsee this last year, and attempt to\ntrade LaValliere last year itself? Any fool could tell them LaVAlliere\nwasn't very fit last year.\n\n6) Dennis MOeller is SCARY!!!\n7) Candeleria: Well, he is not going to have such a high ERA at the end of the\nseason. Maybe it will be in 3-4 range. BUt $1 million  plus? Come on. Other\nthan the customary home run giving stage Patterson goes through for a few weeks,\nPatterson has served the PIrates very well each year. So far, he seems to have\npitched well for the Rangers. I think the PIrates should have spent the money\non Patterson in stead.\n\n8) The Rookie batters: Well, Young has surprised me a bit with his instant impact. Other than that, their excellent performance hasn't been too much of a surprise. I think we should thank Doughty for that.\n\n9) Rookie Pitchers: Worse than expected, especially Cooke.\n10) Slaught: How come he wasn't given a contract extension last year? NOw his\nvalue has increased immensely.\n\n11) Lonnie Smith!! Well, Eric Davis was signed for a comparable amount.\nLet's see. Eric can hit better. He can run better. He can field better.\nNow why didnt the PIrates go after Eric Davis. An injured Davis is better\nthan a healthy Lonnie Smith. Even if Lonnnie Smith gets some big hits this year,he won't be an asset. He has looked terrible on the bases and in the field.\n\n12) Management: BIG BIG ZERO. Sauer has yet to make a forceful agreement\nin favor of revenue sharing. He seems more concerned about pleasing that\nidiot Danforth by preparing the team for a move to Tampa Bay.\n13) Alex Cole fiasco. The PIrates infield and CF positions look good. The\nRF and LF would have looked good if we could have gotten Cole to replace\ntwo of the four outfielders. Eric Davis, Van Slyke and Cole would have made a\nvery respectable outfield. Even without Eric Davis, thye PIrates would have\na respectable outfield with Cole, SVan Slyke, and Merced(I think he should hit\nleft handed against lefts in stead of switch hitting). Simmons did have options\nfor the outfield. Ironically, the biggest accomplishment of Simmon's tenure was\ngetting Alex Cole really cheap. Too bad.\n\n14) Compensatory draft picks for Bonds: Forget it. The pirates can rant and rave.\nthey will not get those picks. As of now, the issue is still being appealed.\nNow, if this doesnt convince anyone that Simmons and Sauer are idiots,\nnothing else will.\n\nOn a final note. Tim Wakefield won't be as awful as he was in his last 2\nstarts. BUt don't count on him pitching like last year for the rest of\nthe season. Also, if the Pirates are in contention towards rthe end of the\nseason, they will miss Redus's clutch hitting and his speed(he has peaked\nin the second half of the last 2 seasons)>
writes a "Who woulda thunk it" article which is really the same piece\nevery time.   "Who would have thought that [Buddy Biancalana] would have\nmore home runs than [the Colorado Rockies, Babe Ruth, Omar Vizquel and\nNolan Ryan] COMBINED!"   He's an idiot, if it's the same guy.
: I think Dean got hit by a pitched ball the other night... he got pinch hit for\n: and didn't play against Baltimore tonight... whats up with that? Is he hurt?\n: Please tell me he's not...\n\nHe evidentally got hit in the elbow by a Fernando pitch.  His arm swelled\nfrom the elbow to the wrist (or something like that).  They took X-rays\nof the arm and there is nothing damaged.  He missed the last game with the\nOrioles, but he is suppose to be ready for the next game.\n\nHope this helps.
i have no idea, nor do i care.  however, i'd like to point out that\nblomberg got the first plate appearance by a designated hitter, and\nthe first walk by a designated hitter.  i am not sure, but i do not\nthink that he also got the first hit by a designated hitter.
What position does Mike Lansing play?  I cannot seem to find it \n anywhere.  Thanks!!!!1\n\n	K-->\n--
a lot of batters lean in when pitches come.  rickey's crouch tends\nto exaggerate that, i think.\n\n"a great player to watch if you forget who he is" - "unbiased"... hmmm...
Actually, Gaetti's first year with California was 1991.  His .632 DA wasn't\nout of line with his career averages, and his .616 was actually below average\nin 1988.  But check out the last three years at the Metrodome.\n\n1990\nGaetti  .655\nAL Avg  .604\n1991\nPags    .744\nLeius   .653\nAl Avg  .620\n1992\nLeius   .680\nAL Avg  .603\n\nFor the last three years, the highest DAs in either league have been posted\nby Minnesota players -- three different ones, including one (Pags) who was\nmediocre to horrible elsewhere.  That doesn't *prove* a park effect is at\nwork, any more than San Diego's horrible infield numbers prove a park effect\nis at work.  But it looks like a strong possibility to me.\n\n  Lots\n\nAnd it might even be a nice play to thrid base.\n-- \nDale J. Stephenson |*| (steph@cs.uiuc.edu) |*| Baseball fanatic
[snip]\n[stats deleted - we've all seen them by now]\n\nI nominate this last bit for "Anti-Stathead Quote of the Week".\n\nAlomar only has a 50 point advantage in the most important offensive\ncategory, while Baerga, who studied in the Joe Carter School of Out-Burning,\nhas more impressive mediot stats, largely due to opportunities rather\nthan quality.\n\nThe lines are fairly close in value, but edge to Alomar.\n\nNow Baerga ain't chopped liver, but Alomar is still the man to beat among\nAL second basemen...\n\n--Craig
Disclaimer -- This is for fun.\n\nIn my computerized baseball game, I keep track of a category called\n"stolen hits", defined as a play made that "an average fielder would not\nmake with average effort."  Using the 1992 Defensive Averages posted\nby Sherri Nichols (Thanks Sherri!), I've figured out some defensive stats\nfor the second basemen. Hits Stolen have been redefined as "Plays Kurt\nStillwell would not have made."\n\nOK, I realize that's unfair.  Kurt's probably the victim of pitching staff,\nfluke shots, and a monster park factor.  But let's put it this way:  If we\nreplaced every second baseman in the NL with someone with Kurt's 57.6% out\nmaking ability, how many extra hits would go by?\n\nTo try and correlate it to reality a little more, I've calculated Net\nHits Stolen, based on the number of outs made compared to what a league\naverage fielder would make.  By the same method I've calculated Net Double\nPlays, and Net Extra Bases (doubles and triples let by).\n\nFinally, I throw all this into a a formula I call Defensive Contribution, or\nDCON :->.  Basically, it represents the defensive contribution of a player.\nI add this number to OPS to get DOPS (Defense + Onbase Plus Slug), which\nshould represent the player's total contribution to the team.

I AGREE, LUMBERJACK (except that they're in 2nd)!  They ARE going PLACES -\nSan Diego, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Cincinnati, Denver, Atlanta, Miami,\nPhiladelphia, New York, Montreal, Pittsburgh, Chicago, St. Louis...and\npoints in between.  :-)\n\nBut,\nTHEY'RE 0-3 AT HOME!\n\nI'm just not used to an overly enthusiastic Houston fan.  I really shouldn't\ndiscourage it, so HANG IN THERE, LUMBERJACK!  (But, get ahold of that shift\nkey, will ya?)\n\nObBase:  Apparently the new owner (Drayton McLain (sp?)) doesn't particularly\nlike excuses.  An item in our paper (the Austin American-Statesman - "If you\nread it here, it was somewhere else first") said that he wouldn't take \ninjuries as an excuse for losing because that possibility should have been\naccounted for.  Uh, oh.  I don't want an owner that'll keep everybody on\nedge - I'd never gotten that feeling about him, but who knows?  Does \nanybody down there in the Houston area have a feel for how meddling of an\nowner McLain is going to be?
Boy, hats off to any Cubs fan who can actually muster up the courage to put\ndown Braves fans.  I mean, all the Braves have done is gone to two consecutive\nworld series.  Also, being the Cubs fan that I am, I really have to hand it to\nall the Braves fans out there that are capable of driving me crazy with that\ninfernal cheer that they have.  \n\nHowever, I do have to protest anyone saying that all Cubs fans are stupid.  The\nway I see it, either I'm just too stupid to acknowledge it, or that observation\nwas just plain wrong.  You might have us confused with Bear fans. ;)\n\nAnyway, about a two weeks ago just about everyone was saying that the Cubs\nwould finish up last in their division.  (Even behind Florida?!?  Sheesh!)  \nThese same people were predicting the Braves to clean up in their respective\ndivision.  Well,  we're ten games into the season and these people are a little\nless vocal now.  I wonder why.\n\nWell, the way I see it, the East is up for grabs, and whoever wants it most is\ngoing to take it, with the exception of Florida.  Every team seems to have\ngood batting and pitching, with Philly presently leading the pack.  But, I just\nhave to point out, if the Cubs do take the East, they'll do it without the\nbenefit of a competent manager.  However, and it pains me to say it, the\npennant is going to go to the West.\n\nJust had to get that off my chest.\n\n						Doc
My favorite was the Barry Foote homer that bounced on Waveland and through\na second floor window across the street.  Second though, would be the Kong\ndrive that was last seen bouncing down the street that dead ends to the \npark at Waveland.
Alomar fans left RBI fans and Runs off this list because they are dependant\non the team. (To a large extent). If Frank Thomas hit first, he'd lose a LOT\nof RBI's; and anyways how many 2nd place hitters have you known to drive\nin 100 runs? Doesn't happen that often.....very unlikely with Devon White's\n~.300 OBP in front of you...
Learn what?  I know that 3 million dollars is A LOT of money.  I know \nRickey Henderson doesn't have a career out of baseball.  I know if he \ndidn't have baseball, he wouldn't be making near the money he is now.\n\nI just don't understand how some athlete, who only plays a sport for a \nliving for millions of dollars, say he is not being paid enough.\n\nIf nobody will sign him for his asking price, he will be the one hurting.\nThe A's will still win without him.\n\nRemeber, many of these athletes have NOTHING if not for their athletic \nability.  NOTHING.  They are getting paid MUCH more than most hard working\ncitizens, and they are complaining of not enough pay.
Currently, he's all over.  He played 2nd when Deshields was out.  He was\nshifted to third when Delino came back.  And today, he played SS for a cold\nWil Cordero.  \n\nHis natural positions seem to be in the middle infield, but they will seemingly\nfind a spot for himm somewhere as long as his bat is hot.
Also, Alomar got a FAR greater boost from his home park than Baerga did from \nhis. And "six or seven home runs"? Hmm.\n\nSo, if you wanted to pick a second baseman to play in Toronto, you'd take \nAlomar. Anywhere else, and you'd probably take Baerga.\n\nMike
I have noticed that this year has had a lot of high scoring games (at least the\nNL has).  I believe one reason are the expansion teams.  Any thoughts?
One "t" in "Eddie Mathews"!\nBecause a small advantage in fielding ability comes nowhere near\nmaking up for the large difference in hitting.  Their average\nseasons, using their combined average 656 (AB + BB) per 162 games:\n\n         Years  AB  H  R  2B 3B HR RBI TB  BB  AVG  OBP  SLG  OPS\nSanto    14.10 577 160 81 26  5 24  94 268 79 .277 .366 .464 .830\nRobinson 17.55 607 162 70 27  4 15  77 243 49 .267 .325 .401 .726\n\nFielding, we have, per 162 games at third,\n\n         Years   P    A   DP   E   PCT\nSanto    13.15  149  348  30  24  .954\nRobinson 17.72  152  350  35  15  .971\n\nEven if Robinson's extra 3 putouts, 2 assists, and 5 DPs are taken to mean\nhe was responsible for 10 more outs in the field, that doesn't make up\nfor the extra 28 outs he made at the plate, not to mention the fewer\ntotal bases.  The difference of .104 in OPS should be decreased by about\n.025 to account for Wrigley, but a .079 difference is still considerable.\nThe Thorn & Palmer ratings are\n\n           Adjusted      Adjusted    Stolen   Fielding  Total\n           Production  Batting Runs Base Runs   Runs    Rating\nSanto         123          284        -14       137      41.7\nRobinson      105           52         -5       151      19.8 (26.3)\nUsual disclaimers about T&P's FR apply, but they really shouldn't be\nway off the mark in this comparison.  At least it's better than fielding\npercentage: Carney Lansford has a .966 , 10th best all-time, but -225 FR,\ndead last of all time.  Also, since this total rating compares players\nto league average instead of replacement level, Robinson should be\nawarded an extra 6.5 or so for playing 653 more games.  He had a great\ncareer, but I would prefer Santo's plus 4 years of a replacement level 3Bman.\n\nBut I would knock Traynor off the list and replace him by Stan Hack.\nThat's a similar story, Hack's far better hitting outweighs Traynor's\nsuperior fielding.  Graig Nettles and Buddy Bell would also be better\nchoices (IMHO of course, though some recent net discussion supports\nthis point of view.)\n\nShouldn't that be right field?

Of course a run scored is just as important as a run prevented.\nJust as a penny saved is a penny earned.  Enough with the cliches.\nMy point is that IF the Braves starters are able to live up to\ntheir potential, they won't need much offensive support.\nI realize this is a BIG IF.  This staff leaves the '92 BoSox in the dust.\nThere is no legitimate comparison.  Two Cy Young winners, and three other\npitchers that most any team in the league would kill to have as their first\nor second starter.  It seems to me that when quality pitchers take the\nmound, the other teams score less runs.  The team that scores the most \nruns wins.  This puts the team with the better pitching at the advantage\n(providing they can stop the opposing team from scoring runs).  A low \nscoring game would clearly benefit the Braves.  They should have many \nlow scoring games due to their excellent pitching and below average hitting.\nOn the flip side, if you had a starting lineup of great offensive players,\nI would be arguing that this team would not need great pitchers.\nThey would have an advantage because they could simply outscore their\nopponent.  The name of the games is to win.  Even Ray Knight knows that\nyou do this by putting more runs up on the scoreboard.\nAll I'm trying to say is that if you assemble the quality pitchers\nlike the Braves have, the offense doesn't need to be as strong.
David Vergolini writes\n\nYeah, if the Tigers can keep scoring 20 runs a game.  If I'm reading all this  \nwoofing correctly, one midseason slump is going to pull this team out of  \ncontention.  Like Yogi says, I'll believe when I believe it.
The Giants always hit Maddux well, but it was interesting that Maddux\ndid not pitch around Bonds to get to Clayton last night.  He threw 2 straight\nfastballs over the plate to Bonds in the 1st last night, got away with the\nfirst one, but Bonds hit the second one out of the park.  Then in the 3rd,\nwhen Clark was at third base with one out, Maddux did not intentionally\nwalk Bonds, and Bonds dropped a single to left-center.\n\n     The Braves announcers pointed out that McGee as a leadoff hitter has\nnot scored a run yet.  He will always hit around .300, but I'm concerning\nabout his on-base percentage.  The key in the lineup is Matt Williams, he\nhas to stay hot so that Bonds can hit with runners on base.\n\n\n\n     The pitching gets a set back as Bud Black is placed on the DL.  Burba\nhas done a superb job filling in so far, he looks like a different pitcher\nfrom last year.  However, Swift is terrible in both of his starts.  With\nBurba moving into the rotation, Mike Jackson is the only right-handed\nreliever aside from Rod Beck, he'll get a lot of actions.  I also hope that\nDusty can manage his bullpen better than Roger Craig, especially on Beck.\nI was concerned when Beck was used for 3 straight days earlier this week.\n\n\n\n     So far so good!
After the marvelous "time-out" call by Chris Webber (which resulted in \na technical foul, since his team had no time-outs left) perhaps Webber \nwill take the place of Bill Buckner as the master of choke.  At least \nthis Red Sox fan hopes so.\n\nTed

Catcher is their weakest position, with the possible exception of second base.\nThey have a chance to simultaneously replace their biggest offensive problem\nspot with a well-above-average offensive player *and* acclimate a highly\npromising potential star with no pressure on him to carry the team, and they\nwant to play *Olson* and *Berryhill* instead?!\n\n\n"A catcher's defensive reputation will be inversely proportional to his\n recent offensive level of performance."  Thus, Mickey Tettleton goes (in\n the media) from being a no-hit defensive whiz to a slugging thumb-finger\n in two short years.  The rule doesn't apply to perceived "superstars", who\n get the Gold Glove Offensive Transfer effect instead.  Greg Olson is probably\n considered to be a good defensive catcher precisely because he can't hit.\n\n\n\nAren't they the same thing?\n\n\nEither that or just stupidity.\n\n\nOf course.\n\n\nOne could make the same sort of argument in other cases.  Pete Rose, in\npursuing Ty Cobb's record, was a huge gate attraction (and national media\nmagnet).  The Reds made a lot of money off that; they also wasted the prime\nof Eric Davis.  That may be "good business", but that doesn't mean I don't\nloathe them for it.
As I have read this net the last few days, I am continually amazed at the \npronouncements of baseball prowess by many individuals.  Especially when it \ncomes down to saying that the Bosox haven't a prayer.  As a long time Red Sox\nfan, I will simply say:  The Impossible Dream Year - 1967 for those of you\nwith short memories. short lives, or both.  \n\nTo be a Red Sox fan is to continually be the subject of abuse and criticism\nfrom those who only follow 'the hot team'.  This statement is supported based\non the increased number of 'Brave Woofers' out on the net.  A true fan of a \nteam, any team, will follow that team through the good years as well as the lean\nyears, and be amply rewarded when the time is right.  \n\nYeah, so what if Buckner let a roller go through his legs in `86.  Who cares if\nClemens told Cooley to go piss up a rope and promptly earned a quick shower.  The\nfact is, they were one of the best teams in the league those years and the fans\nsupported them.  Now that it appears that they are on lean times, the number of \ndetracters come from all over.  So what!  Let them play and we will see what \nhappens come September.  The Red Sox may not be that good, but they are certainly \nnot that bad, either and they do have a chance to win the World Series, after all,\nremember the `69 Mets?  Who would have given them a chance to even make it that\nfar, let alone beat Baltimore.\n\nLet's face it, Baseball is a wonderful game and is far more unpredictable than Football\nand Basketball.  Because of this, one can never say with absolute certainity what\nthe outcome will be over the course of 162 games.
Bobby Bonilla supposedly use the word 'faggot' when he got mad at that author\nin the clubhouse.  Should he be banned from baseball for a year like Schott?
The Royals are darkness.  They are the void of our time.\nWhen they play, shame descends upon the land like a cold front\nfrom Canada.

Dave Winfield's name does not go\n\n\n\n       In terms of PEAK, and I repeat PEAK years, Winfield has Done it  \nall. He has batted in the 340's for a season, drove in 100 and more runs  \nmany times in a row before his injury. Consistently hit at or near 300  \nwhile knocking in 35 home runs. Have you even LOOKED at Dave Winfield's  \nslugging percentage for three or 4 of his best seasons. I still think that  \ndave was one of the BETTER of all time, but obviously not the best. He was  \none of the best athletes evr to play baseball. He hit line drives that hit  \nthe scoreboard in left-center field, a feat np one has done in the new  \nStadium. Heck, only 2 or 3 other people have hit it over that green fence  \nsince it has been remodeled. He could field, had a bullet arm, and his  \nhitting was comparable in many seasons to gary sheffields, and barry bonds  \nof last season. He is older now, and slowing down, takes more of an  \nuppercut to lift the ball out of the park, but he will always be my hero,  \nand my idol. There is nothing that could make me happier than George  \ninviting Dave back to the Bronx to play his last year of ball with the  \nYankees. Of course, he will most likely refuse the offer, but who knows?  \nFor 3 million dollars, he'll play. Heck they are giving gallego 2.5  \nmillion this year, having Dave as their DH, while leaving him time to play  \nthe field when Tartabull is injured, or Nokes and mass are traded, should  \ngive the Yanks the inspiration and leadership that will sweep in a new age  \nof Yankee domination.

The media is beating the incident at Dodger Stadium on Wednesday to\ndeath, but I haven't seen anything in rsb yet.\n\nGerald Perry of the Cardinals pinch hit in the eighth inning with two\non and his club down by a run.  He stroked a line drive into the\nright field corner.  The ball cleared the three-foot high fence and\nwent into the crowd.  Darryl, racing over from right center, got to\nthe spot in time to reach his glove up over the short fence, but he\nmissed the ball.  A fan sitting in the front row, wearing a mitt,\nreached up and caught the ball.  Home run.\n\nNow I've seen the replay several times and I have concluded that\nDarryl missed the ball, and that the fan's glove was essentially\nbehind Darryl's.  Several Dodger fans with seats in the immediate\nvicinity have claimed that the fan unquestionably interfered with\nStrawberry.  What cannot be disputed, however, is that the fan\nwho caught the ball never took his eye off it;  he was oblivious\nto where the fielder was playing.  He was also quite exuberant as\nsoon as he realized he had made the catch.\n\nThat exuberance disappeared immediately, however, when Strawberry\nwent into a tirade at the man.  All reports indicate he used a lot\nof profanity and accused the man of interference, and therefore of\ncosting the Dodgers a game.  Shortly afterwards other fans hurled\nfood and beverages toward the man who made the catch.  Dodger Stadium\nofficials started to remove him from the park, but then relented and\njust relocated him to another area.  In an interview after the game,\nLasorda blamed the fan for the loss.  Strawberry also went into a\ntirade about how the fans are stupid and they don't care about \nwinning.  L.A. Times columnists similarly blasted the man who made\nthe catch.\n\nBefore each Dodger game the public address announcer makes a speech\nwherein he says that fans are welcome to the souvenirs of balls that\nare hit into the stands as long as they do not interfere with any \nthat are in the field of play.  Was the fan wrong?  Should he have\nbeen more aware of the situation and acted to avoid any possibility\nof interference?  Or was he human and just reacting?  By the way, he\nis a season ticket holder and on his request the Dodgers have relocated\nhis seats to another area of the Stadium where future interference is\nimpossible.\n\nOthers have questioned why Darryl should be so concerned with what\nthe fan did when he has a grand total of 1 rbi through the first\nnine games.\n\nI question what he was doing in right center with a left-handed pull\nhitter up and the game on the line.  Had he been closer to the play,\nhe certainly would have had a much better chance of catching the ball.\n\nBut I guess the big debate continues as to what are the responsibilities\nof the fan.\n\n\n\n--	The Beastmaster
I don't have a history handy, but I don't recall that the preponderance\nof ROY's come from winning teams.  In fact, I think team performance is\ngenerally irrelevant, as almost always the most deserving candidate wins.\nAm I wrong?\n\nAnd he is not necessarily on a losing team.  While the Angels' staff\nis still very weak, their everyday lineup is doing quite well, thank\nyou.  Snow is playing great.  Salmon is learning to make the adjustments.\nEasley appears fine, but even if he's not Flora is ready to come up.\nBetween Gonzales and Gruber they'll manage the hot corner.  Polonia\nand Curtis are steady and heady.  Even Myers and Orton are contributing.\n\nPersonally, I think they can finish over .500 which makes them a \nwinning team.\n\n\n\n\n--	The Beastmaster
The Phillies salvaged their weekend series against the Chicago Cubs\nby beating them 11-10 in a wild one at Wrigley Field Sunday\nafternoon.  It was the Phils only win in the three game series, and\nwas the first time the Phillies have lost a series in the young\nseason.   The Phils jumped to a 6-0 lead in the game thanks to 2\nJohn Kruk 2-run homers and two Wes Chamberlain homers.  However Danny\nJackson, and the Phillies middle relief was unable to hold the lead.\nMitch Williams entered the game with the Phillies leading 8-4,\nhowever Candy Maldonado hit a ninth inning homerun to tie it.  In\nthe 11th, Dave Hollins hit a three-run shot, his first of the year\nto push the Phils ahead to stay.  However, in a shaky bottom of the\n11th the Cubs scored 2 runs and had the tying runner on base when\nthe Cubs pinch hit Randy Myers for Bob Scanlan (they were out of\nposition players) and Myers bunted into a double play to end the\ngame.

Mr. Hernandez Ñ-\n  \n   I apologize for the misunderstanding.  I explained that I know that it\nis essential for some fans to get scores here, for they cannot get them\nelsewhere.  I have no problem with what you do, posting scores AFTER the\ngames have been completed.  However, like I said earlier, I don't think it\nis a necessity to post scores during the middle of games, like some others\nhave come to practice.
The roar at Michigan and Trumbull should be loader than ever this year.  With\nMike Illitch at the head and Ernie Harwell back at the booth, the tiger bats\nwill bang this summer.  Already they have scored 20 runs in two games and with\nFielder, Tettleton, and Deer I think they can win the division.  No pitching!\nBull!  Gully, Moore, Wells, and Krueger make up a decent staff that will keep\nthe team into many games.  Then there is Henneman to close it out.

No, he's not nuts, WIP is second to none THE sports station.  They\ndon't have Tony Bruno working ESPN radio and Al Morganti doing Friday\nNight Hockey because they suck.  I live in Richmond Va, but I visit\nPhila often, and on the way I get WTEM Washington) and WIP.  I hear\nthe FAN at night wherever I go (the signal used to be WNBC, when they\nplayed golden oldies) because you can't avoid it.  Of those three,\nWIP has the best hosts hands down.  Chuck Cooperstein isn't a homer,\nand neither is Jody Mac.  WTEM is too generic to be placed in the\ncatergory.  In fact if you have heard WTEM and the FAN you notice the\ntheme music is identical...same ownership?? I think so!  WIP is\ntotally original.  Their hosts actually have a personality (this is a\nknock at TEM (the TEAM) not the FAN because Mike and the Mad Dog and\nSommers are good) I mean comparing the morning guys in Philadelphia\nto the ones in Washington is a total joke.  Anyway, I like the FAN\nand WIP, but I think the edge goes to 'IP.  \n\nWhen I get back from Philly, I go into withdraw cause Richmond has\nnada except the national sports line (and those guys are totally\nclueless)   \nI was really mad when WCAU was cancelled because they had Steve\nFredericks doing sports phone after the Phillies games.  (WCAU is\nanother strong station, now it's an oldies station, but they still\nhave the Phillies) I started listening to the FAN because I heard he\nwent there.  I finally heard him last summer and he wasn't the same\nguy.  Those NY fans got to him.  I was glad to hear him back in\nPhilly when I went to see a few Eagles games.  \n\n\nI will admit, I am  die hard EAGLES fan and WIP is basically an\nEagles station 365 days a year.  BUT, I bet you the Phillies are in\ncontrol right now.\n\n\nAbout the knock on G. Cobb, I like him.  He knows the Eagles like a\nbook.  I remember the weekend before they went to play San Fran,\n(when everyone thought the Eagles would be blown away) Cobb said that\nthe Eagles usually play their best when no one believe they can win.\nWell they were inches shy of pulling the victory.
Make sure to take the Sutcliff, Fisk, ect. factor into account.
That brings up an interesting point. Anyone else catch ESPN's piece about\nprospects and the relationship between age, career length, MVPs and Hall of\nFame members? It was part of their preseason special. Basically, they looked \nat players that had amassed 1000 plate appearances (or ABs) by the time they\nwere 24, and noticed some interesting things. \n\n  For starters, they found out such players comprised the majority of MVPs in\nthe history of the game. They also found out such players represented the\nmajority of the players in the hall of fame. The kicker, though, was that\nthey actually did some number-crunching and found that such players' careers\nlasted much longer than the careers of players not in that group. They also  \nfound that these players produced at both a greater level of performance and\nproduced over twice the raw totals (HRs, etc) of the other players. The first\ngroup outhit the second something like .282 to .260 in raw BA, and blew away\nthe second group in such categories as HRs, 2Bs, RBIs, etc. \n\n  It was the most impressive thing I've seen on ESPN in recent memory. \n\n  I guess Ray Knight makes his rebuttal tonight.
No....Hal McRae is the worst manager in baseball.  I've never seen a guy who\ncan waste talent like he can.  One of the best raw-talent staffs in the league,\nand he's still finding a way to lose.  I'll be surprised if he makes it through\nthe next 2 weeks, unless drastic improvement is made.

I agree and disagree.  John is saying that the batters efforts will result\nin 4 more wins then losses.  While you are probably correct that 400%\ndoes not mean 4 more wins then losses, it means something.  I would\nrather have a player who increased my teams chances of winning by 1% in\neach of 400 PAs then I would a player who increased my chances of winning\nby .5% in each of 400 PAs.  Thus, there appears to me to be an obvious\npositive association between John's statistic and winning games.  Thus,\nbefore you disregard this stat, it appears to me that further study must\ngo into what sort of relationship there is.\n\n\nThe only problem here is an insistance that these number mean exactly\nhow many wins the team has.  First, we are using averages over many\nseasons and applying them to one game.  Second, remember some players\nperformance take away from the chance of you winning.  That is a\nplayer who gets an out gets a "negative probability" in most cases.\nThus, I'm not sure in any given game when you add up all the numbers\nfor a team who won that they will add up to 1 in that game.  Sometimes,\nthey will add up to more then one sometime, less than one.  Also,\nthe pitchers' bad performances (giving up 6 runs) may have given\nthem a large negative percentage for that game.  Also, any batter that\npulled an 0-4 night would give large negatives.  \n\n\n\n\nNo, but really only because you have a smaller sample size.  I would\nthink however, that the number of runs you score in the first inning\nwould be just as good as a prediction as how many runs you score \nin the last inning.  And, realize something else a closer usually\ncomes in in a close situation, not a blow out.  It is hard to argue\nthat any runs that a closer gives up in a game have equal importance\nto those given up in the first inning.  Look, a closer giving up runs\noften means a team will lose many games.  On, the other hand a starter\nwho gives up runs often still leaves his team a chance to win.  The\noffence has many more outs to do something about.  But, I am not\nsaying all late inning situations are equally important either.  If\nI am down 8 runs in the ninth, it really does not matter how many\nruns my pitcher gives up in the ninth.       \n\n\n\nNo, but why would you assume that the teams probability of winning would\nbe 0 before the possesion in which the free throws were made.  Look,\nif you are down 1 point with 5 seconds left, there is a fairly high\nprobability that you will win the game if you are in possesion of the\nball.  And, do not forget that somebody elses missed shots, turnovers,\nfouls, bad defense, etc. caused a "negative chance" that the team\nwould win.\n \nFrom reading all of the discussion on this statistic, I feel that those\nwho critisize it to a certain extent are doing so out of an agenda.\nAt first look this statistic valadates clutchness.  But, it really\ndoes not.  Cluthness revolves around the idea that certain players\nin crucial situation elevate their performance and others performance\ngoes down.  I've never seen convincing proof that this really happens.\nSo, if you assume there is no clutchness, then that means that except\nfor a lot of noice, this statistic has a positive association to\nplayer performance.  There is a way to get rid of the noice if you\ndo not believe in clutchness.  Certainly, we could find out what\nthe average value of a home run is for example.  We may find for\ninstance, that a home run increases your chance of winning by 15%\non average while a strikeout decreases your chance of winning by 5%.\nI bet if this were done we would find that this statistic was just\nas good as other statistics we have for predicting wins and losses.\n\nHow do we evaluate relief pitchers?  Say John and Sam have the\nexact same pitching statistics (runs, earned runs, K's, BB's,\netc.)  Both had exceptional numbers.  John, however only pitched\nin closer situations, while Sam was a Mop up man.  Who was more\nvaluble to their team?  Probably John.  Who was the better \npitcher?  They were probably about the same.
Ok all you trivia buffs, I have a good one for you.\n\n1.  Prior to the foul bunt rule what is the record for the most foul balls\nby 1 batter during one at bat?\n\n2.  Total pitches?\n\n3.  Who was the batter?\n\n4.  Who was the pitcher?\n\n5.  Same as 1-4 except after the foul bunt rule.\n\nAssociated data would be nice too (such as date, location, teams, etc.)
Or you may be posting this WAY TOO EARLY and be eating your words by\n  mid-season. C'mon, the Phillies haven't proved anything yet. Atlanta\n  was similar to the Phils 2 years ago. They sucked. They started having\n  a good year, but didn't get any respect until they actually won the\n  division. (which is how it should be) So until the Phils AT LEAST   \n  have a good year, not just a good 2 weeks, they won't get any respect\n  either. BTW, Atlanta's .188 BA is actually a compliment to how good\n  the Braves really are. Their record is 6-3. Can you imagine the Phils\n  record if they were batting .188? hahahaha. And Atlanta's hitting will\n  improve dramatically.  \n  No, I'm not a Braves fan. Just defending a good team. \n  Orin.\n  Bradley U.
Well, my question still hasn't been answered: if Spanky was bad enough to\nrelease this year, why did he get so much playing time last year?  Yes, I know\nhe was part of a platoon, and that's why he got more playing time than\nSlaught, but that doesn't answer the question.  If Slaught was so obviously\nbetter this year, wasn't this also obvious last year, and shouldn't he\nhave been taking away some of Spanky's playing time against righties?
Not particularly *in* the World Series. During the season, he was probably\nmore valuable than, say, putting Olerud out there to pitch, but yeah, he\n*was* valuable in getting them there. In the postseason, he sucked dirty\ncanal water through a straw. The Jays won *in spite* of Morris much more\nthan *because of* him.\n\n\nUmm, Roger? Return with us to those halcyon days of a few postings ago,\nwhere the poster Valentine was replying to used # of WS rings as a measure\nof better. The concept is called "context", and you should really become\nfamiliar with it someday.\n\n\nUnless this transaltes to "Clemens hasn't gone into Lou Gorman's office with\na large caliber handgun and refused to come out until he'd been traded to\nthe Jays," I'm at a complete loss as to any possible meaning for it.\n\n\nWhat on earth does this mean? Over their careers, Clemens has "won" 68% of\nthe games he's started, Morris 58%. Per year, Clemens has averaged nearly 17\nwins, Morris just under 15. Would you grant the proposition that preventing\nthe other team from scoring increases your chances of winning  a game? If\nso, then consider that Clemens allows 2.8 runs/9 innings pitched. Morris\nallows nearly a run more per nine innings. In fact, Jack Morris has never in\nhis career had an ERA for a single year as good as Clemens' career ERA. But\nI forget, in the Maynardverse there was obviously some mystical significance\nto Buckner missing that grounder in 1986; had Morris been on the Sox, it\nwould have been a routine groundout, right?\n\n\nSpeaking of stupid, it has been patiently (and not-so-patiently) explained to\nyou many times that attributing greatness to players based on the\naccomplishments of their teams makes about as much sense as claiming that\na racecar has the most attractive paint job because it won the race. Your\ncontinued failure to not only understand but even to intelligently reply to\nany of the arguments presented leads me to the conclusion that you must have\nspent a few too many games in goal without a mask.\n\n\nNo one is crying; the Jays won, and as a team they certainly deserved to win\nat least the AL East. They performed well in two short series and won the\nWorld Series, and I congratulate them for it. As a Red Sox fan, I hope they\nkeep Morris. I was happy when they picked up Stewart, and elated when they\ntraded for Darrin Jackson. You see, unless you believe in some mystical link\nbetween Morris and the offense, you can hardly help but believe that the man\nwas credited with so many wins last year because he got lucky. Luck runs\nout, just like it did in 1982 when he pitched 50-odd more innings than 1992,\ngave up exactly *one* earned run more than in 1992, and went 17-16.\n\nSeriously, Roger, I'd really like to hear your explanation of the difference\nbetween the 1982 Morris and the 1992 Morris. Which one was a better pitcher,\nand why? Did Morris somehow "learn how to win" in the intervening ten years?\nIf so, then why did he go 18-12 in 1991 with Minnesota with an ERA over half\na run lower than 1992?\n\n Mike Jones | AIX High-End Development | mjones@donald.aix.kingston.ibm.com
Yeah Valentine, how many rings does Clemens have? \n\nNothin' like good old fashioned Canadian logic...\n\nBTW: The only good thing I can say about the Jay's rotation this year\nis that it could have been worse.  Stewart might have stayed healthy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--
It's Stankiewicz, not Stankowitz, and he's not Jewish - he's Polish\n(by the way, the correct pronunciation - according to Stanky himself,\nis "ston-KEV-itch". all the sportscasters get it wrong)\n\n\nThe only other Jewish ballplayer I can think of is Ron Blomberg, who is\nbest known as being the first DH to appear in a major league ballgame.
Hank Greenberg, Sid Gordon, Ron Blomberg.
Last year Brein Taylor was in A ball, probably at Tampa in the\nFlorida State League.  I believe he began this year in AA which\nis Albany.  Hopefully George won't rush him and he'll be\nallowed to progress at his own rate to AAA and then to the\nBronx.  This guy is the real thing.
For the second straight game, California scored a ton of late runs to crush\nthe Brewhas. It was six runs in the 8th for a 12-5 win Monday and five in\nthe 8th and six in the 9th for a 12-2 win yesterday. Jamie Navarro pitched\nseven strong innings, but Orosco, Austin, Manzanillo and Lloyd all took part\nin the mockery of a bullpen yesterday. How's this for numbers? Maldanado has\npitched three scoreless innings and Navarro's ERA is 0.75. The next lowest\non the staff is Wegman at 5.14. Ouch!\n\nIt doesn't look much better for the hitters. Hamilton is batting .481, while\nThon is hitting .458 and has seven RBI. The next highest is three. The next\nbest hitter is Jaha at .267 and then Vaughn, who has the team's only HR, at\n.238. Another ouch. Looking at the stats, it's not hard to see why the team\nis 2-5. In fact, 2-5 doesn't sound bad when you're averaging three runs/game\nand giving up 6.6/game. \n\nStill, it's early and things will undoubtedly get better. The offense should\ncome around, but the bullpen is a major worry. Fetters, Plesac and Austin gave\nthe Brewers great middle relief last year. Lloyd, Maldanado, Manzanillo, \nFetters, Austin and Orosco will have to pick up the pace for the team to be\nsuccessful. Milwaukee won a number of games last year when middle relief either\nheld small leads or kept small deficits in place. The starters will be okay,\nthe defense will be alright and the hitting will come around, but the bullpen\nis a big question mark.\n\nIn other news, Nilsson and Doran were reactivated yesterday, while William\nSuero was sent down and Tim McIntosh was picked up by Montreal. Today's game\nwith California was cancelled.
Uh, right.  You also forgot that you can't get an RBI (barring a HR) with\nnobody on base.  What fraction of all runs come on solo HR?\n\nMost runs are scored because there happened to be players on base when the\nbatter did something good.  I use the phrase "happened to be" advisedly.\nLots of people have tried to figure out who the players are who have the\nmost ability to "turn it up a notch" in clutch/RBI/whatever situations, and\nwhat they've found is that there is no evidence that *anyone* has such an\nability to any measurable extent.  There are no clutch hitters.  People who\ntend to do things that *would* cause an RBI if there were somebody on base\nend up getting RBIs proportional to how many of their teammates obliged by\nbeing in position.  \n\n\nI agree.
I have lived in the Boston area for 15 years now.  They have been talking\nabout a new Boston Garden (hockey/basketball) since I've lived here.

I haven't seen enough Royals' games to judge his tactics, so you may have\na point here.  But:\n\n\nIMO, the Royals don't have a chance to win the pennant even if McRae\nsuddenly began channeling for John McGraw.  OK, they have some decent\npitchers.  But when your offense consists of bums like Gagne and Lind\nand McReynolds and McRae and an over-the-hill Brett, you're not going\nto finish .500 unless McGraw brings Christy Mathewson back with him.\n\nI'd say it is hard to evaluate a manager when all of his hitters suck.

I have no first hand experience\nwith her ability as an umpire.\n\nBut I have seen her on talk shows. And her point seems to be\nthat she can call balls and strikes as well as any of the\numpires and she knows the rulebook better than most. It seems\nto me that she is missing the point and if that's how she sees\nthe role of umpires in the game, well I wouldn't promote her\neither.\n\nThe umpires primary role has nothing to do with calling baserunners\nsafe or out; hell, Joe Lundy could do that. Their primary function is\nto maintain order in the game, keep the game moving, and keep the\nplayers from trying to kill each other. \n\nUmpires have to be extremely tough people. That disqualifies most\nof us, both men and women. And if Ms. Postema thinks that she\ndeserves to be a major league umpire because of her command of\nthe rulebook, then I think that disqualifies her as well. Umpires\nneed to command the game; command of the rulebook is secondary.

While Atlanta has the undisputed best starting rotation, I feel that their\nrelief staff may be suspect.  They don't have a real closer -- although\nMike Stanton (4 saves) has been used in that role.  Didn't Stanton start off\ngreat last year and then falter?  Despite this, your point is well taken.\nAtlanta doesn't seem to have the same personality as a NY team, thus is \nunlikely to self-destruct.  For Houston to take 'em, Atlanta needs to\nsuffer some injuries, particularly to their starting rotation.\n\n\n\n  From what I understand, Boever and Murphy were considered expendable by the\nclub.  Houston felt that their positions could be filled by a number of\nplayers..  Art  Doug Jones is the key to Houston's success.  He must have\nanother great year for Houston to challenge in the NL West. \n\nlousey spring.\n\n\n      Right!  A strong rotation will take the pressure off of the troubling\n      bullpen.\n\n\n\n      The unsuspected strength of the lower part of the order has saved the\n      club so far.  Biggio and Finley just aren't doing their job of getting\n      on base.  Instead of filling his role as an RBI man, Bagwell has had to\n      assume Biggio and Finley's job.  Biggio concerns me, since he usually\n      starts the season very strong.\n\n\n                                * * * * * *\n\n     On a side note, are you at all concerned with the rumors concerning\nnext year's uniform?  There is talk that their road uniform will be\n(blech..) traditional grey, with the word "HOUSTON" written across the\nchest.  If I'm not mistaken, their home uniforms may totally eliminate\nthe color orange (shiver..).  McLane's favorite color is red, so...\n     I'm really upset.. the current unforms are dull and the new ones sound\nhorrible.  I'd like to see the uniform of the mid-1980s return.

I happen to be a big fan of Jayson Stark.  He is a baseball writer for the \nPhiladelphia Inquirer.  Every tuesday he writes a "Week in Review" column.  \nHe writes about unusual situations that occured during the week.  Unusual\nstats.  He has a section called "Kinerisms of the Week" which are stupid\nlines by Mets brodcaster Ralph Kiner.  Every year he has the LGTGAH contest.\nThat stands for "Last guy to get a hit."  He also writes for Baseball \nAmerica.  That column is sort of a highlights of "Week in Review."  If you \ncan, check his column out sometime.  He might make you laugh.\n\nRob Koffler

My little mind be boggled!  I don't have a 1993 Rule Book\nyet, so David, would you please post the new wording of Rule 1.01 -- I\nam MIGHTILY curious!  Much thanks.
Yes.  But this is *irrelevant*.  You're talking about averages, when we\nhave lots of information about THIS PLAYER IN PARTICULAR to base our\ndecisions on.\n\nI might as well say "We know that very, very few people are more than 7 feet\ntall, so chances are that Manute Bol is really only 6 foot 4."\n\n\nWhy isn't Lopez likely to hit that well?  He hit that well last year (after\nadjusting his stats for park and league and such); he hit better (on an\nabsolute scale) than Olson or Berryhill did.  By a lot.\n\nAs for rushing...  If there really is a qualitative difference between the\nminors and the majors that requires a period of adjustment (and I don't\nbelieve there is), then wouldn't you rather waste Lopez's 22-year old good\nseason than his 23-year old very good season or his 24-year-old excellent\nseason?  The sooner you get him acclimated, the more of his prime you get to\nuse.\n\n\nThe point was not that 17 AB is a significant sample, but rather that he\nhadn't done anything in spring training to cause even a blockhead manager\nto question whether his minor league numbers were for real, or to send him\ndown "until he gets warmed up".\n\n\nMost players are *never* ready for the bigs.  What does this have to do\nwith Javy Lopez?\n\n\nSee above.  \n\n\nBut I could apply the same reasoning to Frank Thomas or Barry Bonds.  Most\nplayers aren't that good, so they probably won't be that good this year\neither.\n\n\nAnd demonstrated inabilities to hit their way out of a soap bubble.\n\n\nNot superstars, not stars, not even good players.  Maybe average, if we're\nbeing charitable.\n\n\nUmmm.  Justice is a very fine hitter.  Pendleton might have another big year\nin his bat, but he might also spend the season in Hamstring Hell.  Gant is a\nbig question mark.  The Bream/Hunter platoon is decent (not excellent) and\nhas rotten OBP or SLG (depending on who's in).  Blauser is a very valuable\nbat... for a shortstop.\n\n\n\nWanna bet?  The difference between Lopez's bat and Olson/Berryhill could be\n20 or 30 runs over the course of the season.  Given a choice between a player\nwith experience and a player who can play, I'll take the latter every time.\n\n\nJust like Keith Mitchell did?\n\n\nThat was me, and you so far your only counter-proposal is that they\nreally don't understand how good Lopez is, or overvalue experience,\nor some combination of the two.  I think my interpretation was more\nflattering to the organization.\n\n\n[Well-argued but inflammatory reply deleted.]
While we're on the multipurpose subject, let's not forget Shea, which\nwas designed to accommodate both the Mets & Jets.  It was the first\nstadium (I think) to have the box seats on rollers so they could be\noriented at right angles for baseball & in parallel for football.\n\nOf course, with the Jets gone to Jersey (and a truly good football\nstadium), the Mets are saddled with a multipurpose stadium where,\nbecause it's circular, the seats are almost always too far from the\naction.  The Mets announcers--Kiner & Murphy in particular--have\nalways hyped it as "beautiful Shea\nStadium," a tipoff to how unbeautiful it truly is.

Me, too... RBI are a worthless stat. Of course, so is stolen bases because \nsometimes runners are in front of a player that would otherwise run. And of\ncourse pitchers pitch differently with different people on different bases,\nso batting average, slugging and obp out, too.  Hmmm... i guess homers would\nnot count then, either.\nMy point? RBI might not be a perfect stat but nothing is. And no stat (or lack\nof) can tell me there are no clutch hitters. Maybe no stat CAN tell me,\neither, but some people are... I just know it!!! 8)
I made a mistake on the posted article [been fighting food\npoisoning for last 24 hours...]\n\nThe second paragraph should state the following...\n\n"Doctors cleared Sandberg to swing a padded bat at a ball\non a tee and to catch a ball in his gloved hand."\n\nSorry for the error, didn't know it until after posting.

I can't believe this, Howe has an ERA in the 80's He is improving!!!
Your speculation that the two proven veterans will produce better\nthan Lopez is also no more than speculation.  It *does* make\na difference whether the speculation is well-founded or not.\n  \n\nThough this is a good point.  The one speculation is "safer",\nbecause it can be reversed.
Well, actually, most of ours is based on what really happened and yours is\nbased on some fantasy of how it happened. But that's OK, I understand you\nhave a hockey background. Stats like "plus/minus" make RBI look good.\n\n\nOK, how about a straigh answer, then. Here's a very simele question to which\nI'm sure a fair number of us are very interesed in the answer to. Please\nanswer yes or no, Roger:\n Can a pitcher cause the offensive players on his team to score more runs?\nAL only, please.\n\nFor anyone else following along, it is a well-known and demonstrable fact\nthat a team's win-loss record is closely related to the number of runs the\nteam scores and the number the team allows. It's not a definite,\nhard-and-fast function, but there is definitely a correlation. In fact, as a\nrule of thumb, if teams A and B both score X runs and team A allows Y runs,\nfor every 10 runs fewer than Y that team B allows, it will win another game.\nSo, for instance, if we look at the 1991 Toronto Blue Jays, we find that\nthey scored 780 runs and allowed 682, of which Morris allowed 114. All other\nthings being equal, if Frank Viola, with his 3.44 ERA had replaced Jack\nMorris for the 240.2 innings Morris threw (plausible, since Viola threw 238\nfor Boston), the "Red Jays" would have allowed about 15 fewer runs, or\nenough for 1-2 more wins. Now, that doesn't take into account that Viola\npitched half his innings in Fenway, which is a harder park to pitch in\n(particularly for a lefthander) than Skydome. So, um, Roger. Unless you\nreally do believe that a pitcher can somehow affect the number of runs\nhis team scores, could you enlighten us to the fallacy in this\nanalysis? Clearly, it would be foolhardy to claim that Viola would\nnecessarily have put up a 3.44 if he had been on the Jay last year, but\nthat is not the claim. We look at what the actual performances were and\nevaluate Viola's as better than Morris' in the sense that "had Morris\nperformed as Viola did, his team would have been better off."\n\n\nThis is true, but not so open that your brain falls out.\n\n Mike Jones | AIX High-End Development | mjones@donald.aix.kingston.ibm.com
Actually Alomar is a two-time gold-glover (91-92).
What _is_ your problem?  Hite's post wasn't a flame.  It was a\ncorrection of *your* error.\n\nYOUR reply was a flame.  \n\n\nNot in the least.
I've been saying this for quite some time, but being absent from the\nnet for a while I figured I'd stick my neck out a bit...\n\nThe Royals will set the record for fewest runs scored by an AL\nteam since the inception of the DH rule.  (p.s. any ideas what this is?)\n\nThey will fall easily short of 600 runs, that's for damn sure.  I can't\nbelieve these media fools picking them to win the division (like our\nTom Gage of the Detroit News claiming Herk Robinson is some kind of\ngenius for the trades/aquisitions he's made)\n\nc-ya\n\nSean
Dunno about Miller.\n\nIf you mean Scott Erickson, currently the reigning Twins Least Consistent\nGood Player, he pulled a muscle in the neighborhood of the rib cage that\nmade it essentially impossible for him to pitch temporarily, and is\nexpected back on the mound Sunday.
You're right: Thomas, Gonzalez, Sheffield, and Griffey don't even begin\nto compare with Ripken, Boggs, and Gwynn, so no wonder Alomar gets so\nmuch attention.\n\nSandberg got no attention his rookie year because his rookie year was\nterrible.  So was his sophomore year.\n\nNational League pitchers are "much better pitchers"?  That certainly explains\nSheffield's 1993, hm?  Are you confusing "have ERA's that are 0.40 lower\nbecause they don't face DH's" with "much better"?
You're right about the signal being strong. I live in West Philadelphia,\nand I can get FAN almost perfectly. It's a sports fans dream (especially\nif that person is from NY and wants to hear about his teams while he's\naway at school). As for Lupica & Berman, it's turned out to be Lupica,\nthen Berman. Neither of them wanted to work a full four hour show, so Ed\nColeman and Dave Sims' old four-hour slot was broken down into two\nseperate two-hour show - Lupica from 10-12, and Berman from 12-2. And they\nboth happen to suck in comparison to Eddie and Dave.  COME BACK, GUYS!\n\n\nLike I said, I live in Philly, so I can hear FAN and/or WIP whenever I\nwant. But I cannot stand WIP. And it isn't because I loathe the Philly\nsports teams - the Phillies are my favorite NL team (Yanks are favorite\nAL), and the Eagles aren't too bad either. There are two big problems:\n\n	1)Total emphasis on the home teams, especially the Eagles. Unlike\n	  the FAN hosts, who can at least answer a question about an\n	  out-of-town team if a caller asks, the WIP hosts seem\n 	  to have no clue about any team that doesn't play on\n	  Broad Street. Also, FANs periodic sports updates (every 20\n	  minutes) gives sports news and scores from around the\n	  country. It's very rare to hear an out-of-town score\n	  being reported on WIP.\n\n	2)The hosts. With the exception of Jody MacDonald, who I miss\n	  from his days at FAN, none of the hosts really seems to have\n	  both a broad knowledge of the sport or a good on-air presence.\n	  The worst is Gary Cobb, who seems to have been hired solely\n	  on the basis that he used to play for the Eagles.\n\nAnyway, that's my two cents on the whole FAN vs WIP battle.
Cheryl Marks writes\n\nThat depends.  Just how much older were they?
I heard that Eli is selling the team to a group in Cinninati. This would\nhelp so that the O's could make some real free agent signings in the \noffseason. Training Camp reports that everything is pretty positive right\nnow. The backup catcher postion will be a showdown between Tackett and Parent\nalthough I would prefer Parent. #1 Draft Pick Jeff Hammonds may be coming\nup faster in the O's hierarchy of the minors faster than expected. Mike\nFlanagan is trying for another comeback. Big Ben is being defended by\ncoaches saying that while the homers given up were an awful lot, most came\nin the beginning of the season and he really improved the second half. This\nmay be Ben's year. \n	I feel that while this may not be Mussina's Cy Young year, he will\nbe able to pitch the entire season without periods of fatigue like last year\naround August. I really hope Baines can provide the RF support the O's need.\nOrsulak was decent but I had hoped that Chito Martinez could learn defense\nbetter and play like he did in '91. The O's right now don't have many\nleft-handed hitters. Anderson proving last year was no fluke and Cal's return\nto his averages would be big plusses in a drive for the pennant. The \nrotation should be Sutcliffe, Mussina, McDonald, Rhodes, ?????. Olson is an\ninteresting case. Will he strike out the side or load the bases and then get\nthree pop outs? You never know.\nThe way I see the AL East this year (with personal biases mixed in)\nBaltimore\nNew York\nToronto\nMilwaukee\nCleveland\nBoston\nDetroit\n(The top 4 are the only true contenders in my mind. One of these 4 will\ndefinitely win the division unless it snows in Hell/Maryland :). I feel\nthat this Baltimore's season to finally put everything together.)\n__________________________________________________________________________\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
All they said on the radio that he developed stiffness in the shoulder\nafter throwing a curveball that didn't loosen.  Because of the cold\nnight in Denver they decided to remove him from the game rather than\nlet him pitch.  He is expected to pitch his next turn in the rotation\n(expected to be April 20, at Shea vs the Giants).
I was watching the Dodgers/Marlins game yesterday and a couple of\nthings impressed me.  \n\nFirst is that the way the sun was shining in Miami, it had a summer\natmosphere in early spring for baseball.  In comparison Wrigley Field\nin early April still has a wintry look to it with the dead ivy and\nbundled up fans.  \n\nThe second and most important was the fans.  I like these guys/gals!\nI will admit I am a football fan first but I still enjoy baseball.\nIt was interesting because most of these fans are only accustomed to\nthe Miami Dolphins.  The way they were cheering, I thought it was the\nAFC playoffs.  Of course opening day may have A LOT to do with it,\nbut I really got feeling of electricity that I think is lacking with\na lot of baseball fans in other cities.  \n\nBaseball certainly needs a charge and I hope these two expansion\nteams bring back some excitement.  We'll find out Friday how Denver\nBronco fans respond.

Actually, I could care less what his salary is.  It has something to do\nwith the fact that we live in America, and everyone is entitled to\nwhatever he can legally obtain.  If Sandy Alderson and the Haas family\nwillingly negotiate a salary of $35 million per year with Rickey, I couldn't\ncare less.\n\nBut what REALLY GETS MY GOAT is the bullshit he spouted in spring training,\nabout `Well... sometimes I may not play as hard, or might be hurt more\noften, in a place where I'm not appreciated'.  This quote was in the Chronicle\nabout the second week of camp, and strongly suggests that he was going to \ndog it all year if the ownership didn't kiss his butt and ante up some\nmore money.  For God's sake, Rickey, you signed a contract 4 years ago,\nnow honor it and play!  \n\nSay all you want to about Steve Garvey, and believe\nme, I hated him too, but at least when he put his signature on a piece\nof paper he shut his mouth and played hard until the contract was up.

As of today, April 17, Jack Morris has lost his first three starts.\n\nHowever, the Jays are doing well without him and injured Dave Stuart.\n\nThis is a credit to the rest of the pitching staff.
The defenition of the Underdog is a team that has no talent and comes\nout of nowhere to contend.  The '69 Mets and '89 Orioles are prime examples,\nnot the Cubs.  I root for the Cubs, because I feel sorry for them, but \nbasically they are dogs.  The Pirates today are a great example of an underdog.\nIf the Rockies and Marlins compete, they will be underdogs.  The North Stars\ntrip to the Stanley Cup finals was a good example of an underdog's journey. \nThe Cubs have a good team this year, and play in a weak division, they are much\nless than America's Team.
Buck Showalter just can't win. \n\nBob Wickman's pitching the game of his life through eight innings (Yanks\nlead 6-1), so Buck decides to let the kid try and get his first complete\ngame. Wickman manages to get two outs, but in between, four funs score,\nand all of a sudden it's 6-5, and Wickman just can't get the third out.\nSo Buck goes to the bullpen, and Farr gets out the first guy he faces.\n\nLast night, Jimmy Key is pitching another in a long string of games of his\nlife (this guy just keeps getting better!) through eight innings (Yanks\nlead 4-0). This time, Buck thinks, "I don't want a repeat of that\nnear-fiasco with Wickman, so I'll give my bullpen some work." Steve Howe,\nwhose ERA was 54.00 coming into the game, left with it at 81.00. He didn't\ndo too good. Then Farr comes in. He gives up a two-run homer, and the\nRoyals win it, 6-5.\n\nWhat's going on? This is already the third or fourth time this year that\nthe bullpen has blown a lead. Farr & Howe have done it twice together,\nMonteleone's done it once, and I think even Habyan did it once. What's the\ndeal? We finally have terrific starting pitching, so all of a sudden, our\nbullpen turns to shit!\n\nWhat's Buck gonna do? And what's George gonna do if this continues to happen?
I meant to comment on this at the time.\n\nThere's just no way baserunning could be that important - if it was,\nruns created wouldn't be nearly as accurate as it is.  \n\nRuns Created is usually about 90-95% accurate on a team level, and\nthere's a lot more than baserunning that has to account for the\nremaining percent.
Y'know, if current trends continue, the Florida Marlins will be the first\nexpansion team to go 162-0 and outscore their opponents by 486 runs.
That's rich... Ozzie Smith a defensive liability...
boxscores.\n\nBeware.  The original poster looks to be from Louisville, and chances are  \nLouisville gets the edition of the NYTimes that is printed in Chicago for the  \nMidWest.  This edition has boxscores only on Monday (and Sunday) and an  \nextremely skimpy sports section (few game summaries, mostly just color  \nstories).
A lot of teams carry 3 catchers on their 25 man roster,\nbut the 3rd catcher is seldom ever used.  He is only\ninsurance in case of extra innings or the 2nd catcher\nis injured during a game.     So to free up this roster\nspot for an extra pinch hitter or reliever, why not\ninvoke a catcher re-substitution rule:\n\nIf the last roster catcher on a team is\ninjured during a game, the team is permitted\nto substitute in his place for defensive purposes\na catcher who has previously been yanked from\nthe game.   \n\nGiven this rule, a team wouldn't need 3 roster\ncatchers.  The 3rd catcher could be playing\nin AAA or be a non-roster bullpen catcher.
Off and on over the last several months, threads about RBIs and\nrelated topics have gotten me to thinking about how well we can \npredict a player's RBIs using information about his overall\nperformance and the number of runners in scoring position (RISP)\nthat he bats with.  In the Brock2 model, Bill James calculated\npredicted RBIs as RBI=.235*(Total Bases) + Home Runs.  This \ncompletely ignores the context, which was all that Brock2 \ncould do, since context was unknown to it.  So I thought I'd\ntake that idea as a starting point and look how good a fit to\nthe data you get by comparing (RBI-Home Runs) to SLG*RISP.\n\nI've started with team data, using data from the Elias's that\nI've picked up over the years when a) I could afford them and\nb) I could stomach the thought of increasing Elias's profits.\nThat gave me the years 1984-1986, 1988, and 1990.  (I don't \nhave team RBIs for '87 or I could add that year.)  If you\nrun a simple least squares fit to the data you get \n\n(RBI-Home Runs) = 0.81*SLG*RISP.\n\nThe correlation between the LHS and the RHS is 0.86, which is\nsignificant at a ridiculously high level.  So, I feel like the\nfit is good at the team level.  I've no started to move on to \nthe player level and have looked at 4 players (Will Clark,\nOzzie Smith, Joe Carter, and Don Mattingly).  I hope to \nadd quite a few more during my copious free time this year.\n\nIt doesn't do too badly, except the equation underpredicts the\nlow HR hitter (Smith), which may be a fault of the model or it\ncould just be Ozzie.  The results:\n\n                           RBI-HR\n         Years        Actual   Predicted\nCarter  (84-88,90)     400       402.6\nClark   (87,88,90,92)  269       269.6\nMatt'ly (84-88,90)     471       460.8\nSmith   (84-88,90)     317       280.6\n\nI think we can make a case (and I hope to make it stronger) that\nRBIs can be predicted simply from knowing how a player slugs overall\nand how many men are in scoring position when he comes up.\n\nMore later,\nHarold
While I enjoy the trend towards the more classic style of uniform - \nand I disagree with the person who wants a return to the non-gray road \nuniforms - it should be remembered that one of the, if not THE reason \nfor the redesigning of uniforms, especially hats (re: the new road all \ngreen A's caps and the cardinal navy blue road cap), is the marketing \nmoney to be made in sales of new merchandise.
: >Every single piece of evidence we can find points to Major League Baseball\n: >being 50% offense, 50% defense.  A run scored is just as important as a run\n: >prevented.  \n: >\n: This certainly passes the "common sense test" for me, but is there any\n: statistical evidence to say what percent of defense is pitching and what\n: percent is fielding?  I'd really like to know.  BTW, Sherri, thanks for \n: the DA data I find it fascinating.\n\nOne of the chapters in Palmer and Thorn's 'Hidden Game' is titled\n'Pitching is 44% of Baseball,' implying that fielding is 6%.  How do\nthey determine that?  Beats me -- it's been a long, long time since I\nread it.\n\nOne also has to separate offense into batting and baserunning, with the\nsplit probably somewhere around 49.5% and 0.5%.\n--
Well, maybe it will be.  Banks is a 24 year-old prospect who "hasn't \nmatured as quickly as they would have liked.  Mahomes is a 22 year-old \nwho is very highly touted.  Tapani and Erickson are also young, and \nhave looked very good this spring.  The last spot was between Jim \nDeshaies, formerly of Houston and S.D. and Mike Trombley.  Deshaies \nhasn't looked very good this spring, so I believe that the spot has \ngone to Trombley, although they hadn't wanted 3 starters this unproven. \nI personally believe very highly in Mahomes and Trombley.\n\n\nWell, Scott Leius is the shortstop.  He played mostly 3B last year, but \nwas a SS in the minors, and moved back after Gagne left to K.C.  3B is \nsplit (maybe) between Pagliarulo, who has had a great spring, and Terry \nJorgenson, a good looking kid who has languished in Portland for 3 \nyears.  I'm not sure how the time will be divided, but they seem to be \nhappy with what they have here.  I like Jorgenson, but I fear they \nmight give too much time to Pags.\n \n\nSorry, can't help you here.
I wondered the same thing.  When he first mentioned it, I thought he was\njust making a mistake but then he said it over and over.  And then in the\nexamples from other years, he gave stats for players from both leagues even\nwhen only one league expanded.\n\nSo (since stats *NEVER* lie :-) ), I guess there is an effect on both leagues\nbecause the expansion draft takes talent from both leagues equally making \nevery team in both leagues dilute their major league talent by calling up\nplayers that, normally, they would not have had there not been expansion.
Hank Greenberg was probably the greatest ever.  He was also subject to a\nlot of heckling from bigots on the opposing teams and in the stands, but\nit never seemed to affect his performance negatively.

My dad has always blamed the Phillies collapse in '64 on me...  On Sept 21,  1964,  the Phillies had something like a 9 game lead with 12 to play.  I was born on Sept 21,  1964.  The Phils proceeded to lose something like 10 straight while the Cards won 10 straight (does anyone know hte exact numbers?),  and a pennant was blown.  To this day my dad likes to remind me that it all began when I was born!
I've been following the Giants closely over the off-season -- newspapers,\nnotesgroup, etc -- but I had my first up close and personal last night at\nthe Stick.\n\nAfter watching Giants hitters struggle last year, Barry's swing was \nvery impressive -- he's very quick and his swing seems effortless, even\ncompared to Clark (particularly Clark as of late).\n\nIt was interesting to see Bonds hit Maddux so well.  I'm not sure if\nBarry was after revenge against the Braves or what but he stroked\nthree very pretty hits (1b, 2b, hr) for 5 rbi's.\n\nThe Giants as a team are doing a lot of surprising things this year in\naddition to Bonds.  There has been some good pitching and some hitters\nseem to be swinging much better.  Clayton's defense has been superb.\nMcGee seems to like leading off this year.  Manwaring is driving the ball.\nSo on & so forth.\n\nI hope it continues...I think they need to continue well into June before\npeople are really sold that they are for real--particularly the pitching.\n\nFor myself, I think the fresh start of Magowan/Baker/etc has really wiped\nout a lot of negatives from the last few years and will be a real factor\nin helping them significantly improve over last year.
uhhhh there are only three l's.
I tend to agree that players are not hurt by early play in the big leagues.\nThe BRaves organization is a fertile ground to test this hypothesis, as they\nhad little talent on their roster for some time.  Steve Avery, for example,\nwas rushed to the majors, and he fared very poorly during his initial campaign.\nHis subsequent pitching has not been affected by his 5+ ERA during his rookie\nyear.  Bill James pointed out that it was relatively unusual to struggle so\nand then rebound.\n\nBob Horner was also rushed to the majors (out of Arizona State directly) had\ngood numbers immediately.\n\nI am not certain of the ages of people like Pete Smith, Craig McMurty, and\nDerek Lilliquist.  The Braves pitching staffs were so bad when they came up\nthat they might have been rushed.  Lilliquist and Smith struggled, but it\ndidn't hurt PS and DL may have been overhyped.  I seem to recall CM pitching\nwell initially, though I don't have stats handy.
Tom Prince is a 28 year old no-hit catcher.  Think of him as a young Dann\nBilardello.  I can't begin to fathom why the Pirates have been so afraid of\nlosing this guy, who's been in AAA most of the last 5 seasons.  The Pirates\nreleased Kirk Gibson last year because Prince was out of options, then\neventually sent Prince down anyway, and he cleared waivers without a peep.\nHe's another year older, and still can't hit; why do they think he wouldn't\nclear waivers now?  Why would they care?

And Kamieniecki\nisn't doing too poorly himself.\n\nIf the Yankees find themselves in need of a starter, Militello will\nget another chance.  Until then, he'll have to wait in line.

Was going over some videos last night.....\n\nStudying 1986 and 1992 videotapes of Jose Canseco proved to be very\ninteresting.  And enlightening.\n\nHere's my analysis of Jose Canseco, circa Sep '92, and Jose Canseco,\ncirca June 1986.\n\n1.  He's bulked up too much.  Period.  He needs to LOSE about 20 pounds,\n    not gain more bulk.\n\n2.  His bat speed has absolutely VANISHED.  Conservatively, I'd say he's\n    lost 4%-7% of his bat speed, and that's a HUGE amount of speed.\n\n3.  That open stance is KILLING him.   Note that he acts sort of like\n    Brian Downing - way open to start, then closes up as ball is\n    released.  Downing could do this without significant head movement -\n    Canseco can't.  Also, note that Canseco doesn't always close his\n    stance the same way - sometimes, his hips are open, sometimes,\n    they're fully closed.  Without a good starting point, it's hard\n    to make adjustments in your swing.\n\nWhat would I do, if I were Jose?\n\nAside from salting away a large sum of a cash that I could never touch,\nso that I'd never have to work again, I'd restructure my entire swing.\n\nFirst, minimize movement before the swing.  Close and widen the stance,\nand severely cut down the stride I take on my swing.  Hopefully, this\nwill cut down on the time I need to swing, and will allow me to move\nthe bathead more freely.\n\nSecond, drop 20 pounds.  Cut out the weight work.\n\nThird, relax the wrists.  Will cost some power, but until I can find\nmy 1988 stroke, concentrate on keeping the back shoulder up, rolling\nthe wrists through the strike zone, and hit line drives.  His strength\n is more than enough so that some of those line drives will get out of\nthe park.\n\nIf Canseco's open stance and resulting bad habits are a result of his back\nproblems, he'll be out of baseball in three years.  If not, he could\nstill hit 600+ HR.

Am I supposed to take that as a compliment or a put down? Just wondering.\nI do this as a service to the entire baseball world on USENET, especially\nfor those in the East Coast who can't get final scores for West Coast games\nin their newspapers or late TV newscasts. This is helpful to fans in other\ncountries who either receive only weekly scores or updates by the week. Also,\nmany have requested for this kind of service previously but it was only\navailable through BBS's or some pay news services. By the way, mine is free\nof charge and has no copyright restrictions.\n\n\nRemember I only post final scores and the updated standings once a day to the\nrec.sport.baseball newsgroup. Other than that, everything is done through\nprivate e-mail. Currently, there are 986 people on my mailing list that\nbranches off into other mailing lists available for many others. And the list\ngrows by an average of 35 people a day.\n\nIf people on USENET really don't want to see the postings I do to\nrec.sport.baseball on a daily basis, please just let me know. If the response\nis overwhelming against the posts, I won't do it anymore. \n\nThanks for your time.\n\nJoseph Hernandez\n-- \n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nJoseph Hernandez          |    RAMS  | |    /.\  ******* _|_|_  / |   LAKERS\njtchern@ocf.Berkeley.EDU  |   KINGS  | |__ |   | DODGERS _|_|_  | |   RAIDERS\njtcent@soda.Berkeley.EDU  |  ANGELS  |____||_|_| *******  | |  |___|  CLIPPERS
The same Bill James? Why do you say that? It sounds like you're suggesting \nBill James had something to do with overhyping the kid to death. Au contraire;\nhe was fairly critical of him after his ROY campaign, noting that he wasn't\nall-world as a catcher or a hitter. He called him basically average when\neveryone *else* in the media was predicting the next Johnny Bench or Roy\nCampanella. \n\n\n  Which reports are those? \n\n\n  I like Hernandez a lot, but if Piazza can catch the ball, you've gotta play\nhim IMHO. He's a much better hitter, although Hernandez isn't a *bad* hitter.\nRight now, it sounds like Piazza will catch most of the time and Hernandez\nwill be Candiotti's caddy since he can catch the knuckler. As long as they\nplay up to their abilities, the Dodgers could have a very good catching\ntandem.  \n\n\n  I think both are overrated defensively (see Nichols' Law of catcher\ndefense), but that's something that's difficult to prove or disprove from\nyour viewpoint or mine. About the only tangible thing we can look at is\nopponent's SB%, and that's clouded by how well your pitchers hold runners.\nCatchers ERA is a possibility, but it's subject to way too many biases. \n\n  As for them 'playing on a team that is not so much in need of another big\nbat', I disagree here too. About the only chink in the Braves' armor is that\nthey're weak offensively at several positions (CF, C, 2B, SS if Belliard\nplays, 1B unless Bream and Hunter form another super-platoon) and very weak \ndefensively if Blauser plays. I'd like to see the Braves give at least one of\nMel Nieves, Javy Lopez or Chipper Jones a shot, but much like the talent-rich\nJays of recent years they'll be conservative and stick with what they have. \nI'm not saying that's wrong, just conservative.

} How does one read the betting spreads for baseball?  They tend to be something\n} like 8-9 which means it must not be runs!\n\nthat spread means you bet $5 on the underdog to win $8, or $9 on the\nfavorite to win $5.
There are two conflicting reports about a pitcher that is\neither in the Jays' farm system or the Braves'. His name is Bill Taylor.\nHe was picked up by the Jays, but had to be offered back to the Braves\nbefore they were able to send him to the Syracuse Chiefs.
The Phillies were picked to be in first.\nSomeone replied that the people who picked them were the same people who\npicked the Mets last year.\n\nMy reply:  Yeah, that may be true, but this IS the Phillies.
I didn't mean to offend or anything, I'm just quoting Stanky himself on\nthe subject. I remember one time last year he was being interviewed by\nESPN, and the interviewer (can't remember who), asked Stanky if he was\nJewish because he (the interviewer) was Jewish and wanted to see more\nJewish ballplayers. To which Stanky replied, "I'm Polish, not Jewish."\n\nSo maybe that wasn't the most PC thing for Stanky to say, and maybe I was\na little naive when I posted it. I think we should just devote this\nsubject to finding actual Jewish ballplayers (I myself am Jewish and the\nonly ones I ever knew until now were Koufax, Greenberg, and Blomberg).
A month?  Well, he did have a short career--compared to what one might\nhave expected for such a highly touted prospect--due to being injury prone,\noverweight, and having no work ethic.  But he certainly did not\nsuffer from being rushed to the bigs.
Why not? Horner played 130 games in 1985 and hit 27 HR.\nMurphy played 162 and hit 37.\nIn 1986 Horner hit 27 in 141 games and Murphy hit 29 in 160 games.\n(and the Braves lost 96 and 89 games).
Frankly, no.  Offense and defense are equally important.  But the\npitcher is 80% of the defense.  The primary role of every other player\nis on offense.  Even shortstops are a bigger part of the offensive\ngame than of the defensive game.  (They might not do much with their\npart of the offense, but that's another issue.)\n\nThat being said, I think both Smith and Yount deserve the HOF.  They\nhit pretty well in addition to their defense.
Neither did he!\n\n\nOverall?  How do you figure?\n\n\nSo far my radio hasn't exploded from not being tuned to 660...

Nolan Ryan has torn cartlidge inhis right knee.  Is having surgery and\nis expected to miss 2-5 weeks.
It was my impression watching the Mets & Rockies that umpires were\ncalling strikes above the belt, too, but not as far up as the letters.\nIt would be nice if this were the case.
Something else to consider:\n\nAlomar's H-R splits were .500-.363 SLG, .444-.369 OBP! Baerga's was .486-.424\nand .392-.318. Pretty clearly, Alomar got a HUGE boost from his home park.\n\nI'd say you could make a good for them being about equal right now. T&P\nrated Baerga higher, actually.\n\nMike
Oh, oh, we all know what's going to happen now don't we!
Amazingly, pitchers, no matter how good their mechanics, are\nnot machines.  Cy Young winners don't pitch in a vaccuum, unaware\nof how their offenses are doing.\n\n	The Braves' pitching staff is already showing signs of\ncracking under the strain of knowing they're not going to get many\n(if any) runs.  Unfortunately, the Braves' pitchers were so bad for so\nlong that the organization put so much stress (and I mean *stress*)\non pitching that they completely ignored hitting.\n\n	The Braves right now are looking woefully similar to the Braves of\nthe mid-seventies.  Heaven help us.
Uh, I don't think you can call a team with Tom Seaver, Jerry Koosman,\nand Nolan Ryan on the pitching staff a team that has "no talent." They\ndid come out of nowhere, but some of the improvement was\nforseeable.
Here is the OPI (Offensive Production Index) for all AL players with at\nleast 10 at bats.\n\nIt is early in the season so there are some very high numbers.  Last years\nleader was Frank Thomas at 0.682.\n\nTeams are denoted by an * as the first character of the name and each\nplayer has his team preceeding his name.\n\nThe equations used are found at the end of the post.\n\nComments and suggestions are welcome.\n\nKevin\n\nLeague OPI: 0.448\nLeague BA:  0.268\nLeague SLG: 0.405\nLeague OBA: 0.341\n\nRank Player                 OPI     BA    SLG

Ah, so you finally found a use for that super slo-mo and frame advance\nother than scrutinizing "Sorority Babes in Heat". Congrats! \n\n\n  Trust me, you'd have a helluva time manipulating them. Besides, if you\nconverted the film to video you'd have all kinds of artifacts because of the\ndifference in frame rate (unless you're an expert at doing 3/2 pulldown for\na laserdisc company or something). \n\n\n  Hey, no fair! What about 'Fettucine' Alfredo Griffin? The guy practically\nhas to pivot the bat around along with his body. \n\n\n  Daulton doesn't strike me as all that strange. He's a little bit quiet at \nthe plate but, like Franco, gets the bat through the hitting zone on a level\nplane. The first time I watched Julio Franco, I didn't think *anyone* could\nhit like that. Now I marvel at how easy he makes it look; every time he makes\ncontact, it's *solid*. He's got good power to all fields and rarely is he\ncaught not ready for a pitch. \n\n  I wonder if Phil Plantier had a severe bout with hemorrhoids and had to\npractice his swing while 'on the throne'? :-) Sure looks like it :-) \n\n  How 'bout one to add to your list: Travis Fryman? The guy plants his front\nfoot and seems to swing *across* his body. He generates a lot of power, but\nI keep thinking he could generate even more if he could get a better pivot\nout of his hips. \n\n\n  Well, they're already spoken for (by several people), but .. \n\n  I'd add Robbie Alomar's name to the list, among others. I really like Dean\nPalmer's swing, for some twisted reason, as well as Pedro Munoz's swing. \n\n\n  A thought about May: It looks like they've taught him to turn on the ball.\nIMHO, he's going to fall in love with his newfound power and start pulling\noff the ball to the point that he's going to see *lots* of sinkers/sliders\nlow and away. Unless he adjusts quickly and starts rifling doubles to left \nand left-center, IMHO you're going to see a good number of weak grounders to \nthe right side of the infield in the next month.
OK, the Mets and O's are good examples, but what about the '90 Reds?  Do you\nreally think that anyone expected them to sweep the A's?  I know people who\ndidn't even think they'd win a game, let alone win the Series.  We proved \nthem wrong, though, didn't we?\n\nAs for this year, ignore their record now.  They've had a rocky start, and\nthat has nothing to do with Colorado.  They shall rise again.  The hunt for\na Reds' October continues. (with all due respect to WLW)  Bye.
Of all teams, I believe the Cubs have the best record ever in baseball.\nSometime way far back. 110+ and something.
: >baseball players, past and present.  We weren't able to come up\n: >with much, except for Sandy Koufax, (somebody) Stankowitz, and\n: >maybe John Lowenstein.  Can anyone come up with any more.

The Orioles' pitching staff again is having a fine exhibition season.\nFour shutouts, low team ERA, (Well, I haven't gotten any baseball news since\nMarch 14 but anyways) Could they contend, yes. Could they win it all?  Maybe.\n\nBut for all those fans of teams with bad spring records, remember Earl\nWeaver's first law of baseball (From his book on managing)\n\nNo one gives a damn in July if you lost a game in March. :)\n\nBTW, anyone have any idea on the contenders for the O's fifth starter?\nIt's pretty much set that Sutcliffe, Mussina, McDonald and Rhodes are the\nfirst four in the rotation.
} The roar at Michigan and Trumbull should be loader than ever this year.  With\n} Mike Illitch at the head and Ernie Harwell back at the booth, the tiger bats\n} will bang this summer.  Already they have scored 20 runs in two games and with\n} Fielder, Tettleton, and Deer I think they can win the division.  No pitching!\n} Bull!  Gully, Moore, Wells, and Krueger make up a decent staff that will keep\n} the team into many games.  Then there is Henneman to close it out.  Watch out\n} Boston, Toronto, and Baltimore - the Motor City Kittys are back.\n\nnice woofing (or should i say meowing?).\nand yes, the Tiggers are a fun, exciting team that i would pay to see.\nbut last year, they went 75-87. this year, their offense is essentially\nthe same, and their pitching is, at best, essentially the same. so why\ndo you think they will suddenly improve to win the 92 or so games which will\nbe required to win the A.L. East? what has changed that i don't see?\n\nremember, a 20-4 win is worth as much in the standings as a 3-2 win...
Kevin Mitchell's sacrifice fly in the eighth off Brett Saberhagen plated \npitch runner Cesar Hernandez to give the Reds a 2-3 come-from-behind victory over \nNew York. Hernandez ran for pinch-hitter Cecil Espy, who got the inning started \nwith a solid single to right, moved to second on "Bob" Kelly's infield sneaker\ndown the third-base line, and to third on Jeff Branson's well-placed bunt--a \nrare show of excellent execution by the recently hapless Reds offense.\n\nCincinnati trailed 2-0 after starter Tim Pugh blinked in the fifth.  He had only \ngiven up one hit in the first four innings, a fourth-inning lead-off double\nby Vince Coleman.  Coleman was left stranded at third by Bobby Bonilla after\nJoe Orselak popped to short.  Orselak was pinch-hitting for Eddie Murray who \nargued plate umpire Kellogg's inside strike by "drawing the line" (really, he\nshould know better than that).  Murray, and later manager Jeff Torborg ended up getting\ntossed.\n\nThe Mets' fifth started with a Howard Johnson's first-pitch homer.  Pugh must \nhave been slightly shaken, as he was popped on the next pitch by Jeff Kent's\nsingle, then a Ryan Thompson liner to left was (surprise) misplayed by Mitchell\nand turned into a RBI triple. Catcher Hundley's grounder to the drawn-in Branson\nfailed to bring Thompson in, then the play of the game occured:\n\nSaberhagen was due up, so Reds pitching coach Larry Rothschild met with the infield\nto discuss the possibility of a suicide squeeze.  They called it perfectly:\nThompson was hung out to dry after Pugh's first-pitch pitch out and the threat ended.\n(Isn't the NATIONAL LEAGUE great??)\n\nThe Reds picked up 2 runs in the seventh to knot up the game.  After Barry Larkin's\nground out, Mitchell, Chris Sabo, and Randy Milligan got back-to-back-to-back\nsingles--the third scoring Mitchell.  Reggie Sanders then plated Sabo with a long\nfly to center.  A double by Oliver might have scored runner Dan Wilson, but\nthird base coach Dave Bristol threw up the stop sign too late--Wilson himself was\nhung out to dry killing the Reds rally.\n\nRob Dibble came on in the ninth and pitched shakily.  With two outs and a runner\non second Bonilla came to the plate and all I could think of was the Sunday game\nin late August last year when Bonilla's three-run dinger slapped a loss on\nDibble and spelled the beginning of the end for Cinci's season.  Bonilla ended\nup walking, and HoJo flied out to left to give the Reds their first win in a \nweek, and earned Dibble his third save in as many opportunities.  The win went\nto Steve Foster (1-2) who got in what must be an ego-boosting two perfect innings\nwork, striking out three.  Saberhagen (2-1) got the loss--though I'm a bit\nsurprised he even pitched in the eighth.  I'll take it, though.\n\nThe Reds are now 3-9, still the worst team in baseball with the Royals victory\ntoday.  The Mets are 6-5.\n\n\nThe Line:\n\nNew York Mets\n\n			AB	R	H		K	BB	LO\n-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------\nColeman lf		4	0	1		0	0	0\nFernandez ss		4	0	0		1	0	0	\nMurray 1b		1	0	0		0	0	0\n  Orselak ph/rf		3	0	1		0	0	0\nBonilla rf/1b		3	0	0		2	1	1\nJohnson 3b		3	1	1		1	0	2\nKent 2b			3	1	1		1	0	0\nThompson cf		3	0	1		1	0	0	\nHundley c		3	0	0		2	0	0\nSaberhagen p		3	0	0		0	0	0\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTotals			30	2	5		8	1	3\n\nHR-Johnson (off Pugh, leading off fifth, 0-0 pitch) \n3b-Thompson (off Pugh, in fifth, 0 out, 1 RBI, picked-off)\n2b-Coleman (off Pugh, in fourth, 0 out, 0 on, stranded at third)\nRBI-Johnson, Thompson\n\n\nCincinnati Reds\n\n			AB	R	H		K	BB	LO\n-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------\nKelly cf		4	0	1		0	0	0\nBranson 2b		3	0	1		0	0	0\nLarkin ss		3	0	0		0	1	0\nMitchell lf		3	1	1		0	0	0\n  Dibble p		0	0	0		0	0	0\nSabo 3b			4	1	1		1	0	2\nMilligan 1b		3	0	3		0	0	0\n  Wilson pr/c		0	0	0		0	0	0\nSanders rf		2	0	0		0	0	1\nOliver c/1b		3	0	1		1	0	1 \nPugh p			1	0	0		1	0	0\n  Roberts ph		1	0	0		1	0	0\n  Foster p		0	0	0		0	0	0\n  Espy ph 		1	0	1		0	0	0\n  Hernandez pr/lf	0	1	0		0	0	0\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTotals			28	3	9		4	1	5 (*)\n\n(*) Oliver was stranded in the seventh after his double when Wilson was run down.\n\n2b Oliver (off Saberhagen, 2 out, runner on first, stranded)\nRBI-Milligan, Sanders, and Mitchell\nSac-Branson\nSF-Sanders and Mitchell\nIBB-Larkin\nGDP-Larkin\n\n\nNew York	0  0  0    0  2  0    0  0  0    ---- 2-5-0\nCincinnati	0  0  0    0  0  0    2  1  x    ---- 3-9-0\n\n\nPitching\n\n			IP	R	ER	H	K	BB\nNEW YORK\nSaberhagen (L 2-1)	8	3	3	9	4	1\n\nCINCINNATI\nPugh			6	2	2	4	4	0\nFoster (W 1-2)		2	0	0	0	3	0\nDibble (S 3)		1	0	0	1	1	1\n\n\nPB- Wilson\nEjected-Murray, Torborg\n\nUmps-Kellogg/Relliford/Runge/DeMuth\n\nAttendance 32,435\nT- 2:23\n\n\nComing up:\nThe Reds travel to Pittsburgh for three then continue on into Chicago for\nthree.

Well, OBP is the most important offensive statistic, and by a big margin.\n50 points of OBP is worth considerably more than 50 points of slugging.\nThat being said, I still think Baerga was VERY SLIGHTLY better last year,\nbut I think this is as close to a wash as you're likely to find.\n\nI personally don't care much for Alomar's defense.  I don't think he's\nnearly as good as people make him out to be, and he can't turn the DP\nto save his life.  He comes across the bag improperly, and his release\nis slow.  Considering the high leverage of the DP, this is a shortcoming\nI can't overlook.  In the long term, I'd move Alomar to another position.\n\nIf the Jays could trade a hot Devon White for something, I'll be Alomar\ncould be a hell of a CF.  In the long run, I think I'd rather have Jeff\nKent at 2B and Alomar in CF than Alomar/White.

If you think that's bad, just wait until he tries Dunston in\nthe leadoff spot again.  \n\nYes, I also wonder if they can win with this manager.\nI never believed managers had that much to do with winning\nuntil I saw how much they had to do with losing....
There was an article on Jewish major leaguers in a recent issue of "Elysian \nFields", what used to be the "Minnesota Review of Baseball".  As I recall, \nit had an amazing amount of research, with a long list of players and a \nlarge bibliography.
What about U. Johnny Hodapp, the greatest 2nd baseman in Cleveland Indians\nhistory?  225 hits in 1930, consistantly over .300.  A great, great second baseman.
And then cjkuo@symantec.com (Jimmy Kuo) quoth:\n\nWell, either way, the Reds have to play a man down for 3 days.
Oh, yeah.  Dave Winfield--marginal player.  Guy didn't hit a lick, had\nnegligible power, was a crap fielder and had no staying power.  Dave Winfield,\nnow entering his (I believe) 20th big league season, is still a damn decent\nhitter.  Admittedly, his defense has slipped a great deal, but in his prime,\nhe had a powerful arm and great range.  Take a look at the stats:  I don't \nknow where you even BEGIN to make an argument that Winfield and Kingman are\nsimilar players.  Kingman was a one-dimension power hitter--he couldn't field,\nhe ran like an anvil, hit for a low average (though, if I remember right, his\nOBP wasn't THAT hideous...), and (for those who consider such things important)\nwas a absolute-primo-dick.  \n	Eddie Murray?  Yup, only the best 1st baseman of the 80's.  I know that\nMVP votes are conducted by mediots, but given that he got jobbed out of the\nMVP he deserved in 1983, it seems that he wasn't overrated by the media.  \n	Lee Smith?  Hmmmm... This one's actually pretty close.  He's had a s\nsolid, dependable career as a closer despite pitching in some nasty parks \n(Wrigley, Fenway...).  I'd have to take a closer look at the stats (it's been \na while), but it seems Lee Arthur is of HOF caliber.  \n	You do make a legitimate point about the HOF credentials of relievers,\nsimply racking up a lot of saves doesn't mean a whole hell of a lot if you \nblow a bunch, too.  Simply because Minnesota and Boston and (for a month)\nAtlanta used Reardon as a closer for longer than he should have been one, \nthe Equalizer has racked up an impressive number of saves.  No way should \nHomerMan be in the HOF, IMHO.\n	Darrell Evans?  Nice career, actually a bit underrated (kinda like\nTed Simmons, IMHO), but not a HOF'er.\n\n\n	Lemme ask you this.  Who the hell playing the game ISN'T marginal?\n\n\n	Now, wait a goddamn minute here.  Ozzie Smith absolutely REDEFINED the\nposition of shortstop.  His defense was SO good that he's won something along\nthe lines of 10 Gold Gloves.  Again, Gold Gloves are mediot-biased, and a \ngood argument could be made that Larkin deserved one or two of Ozzie's more\nrecent awards, but usually, this is tempered by someone else in the early\n80's getting the Gold Gloves Ozzie deserved earlier in his career.  Ozzie's\noffense, you ask?  Good OBP, great speed numbers, in a park which, for most of his\ncareer, depressed offense, admittedly, no power ('cept against Tom Niedenfuer\n:-|), but still, a definite asset offensively.\n	Yount?  3,000 hits, MVP at two different positions, uh-huh, a real\nstiff.  His '82 was one of the great years EVER by a player in recent memory,\nand probably ranks behind only the peak seasons of Wagner and Banks, as far as\nSS numbers go.  He's a clear HOF'er, IMHO.\n\n\n	Well, as far as Garvey goes, you're right.  Garvey is a "mediot" \ncandidate, pushed because of his "winning attitude" (a minor factor, if one\nat all), and his "great defense" (no errors, admittedly, but the range of\na tree stump...).  Garvey shouldn't be in the HOF.\n	SkyJack?  I've said a lot of nasty things about SkyJack in the last\nyear or so, but this is mostly in response to mediots and woofers who talk\nabout Morris' "ability to win" which is nothing more than Morris' "ability\nto pitch when Toronto to score tons of runs".  At this point, Morris is an\naverage pitcher (although from his early returns in '93, he may be damned \nclose to done.).  But, in all fairness, Morris was a dominant pitcher in the\n80's for up-and-down Tiger teams.  While 1984 was (obviously) a great year\nfor Detroit, the rest of the decade, the team was generally in contention, but\nnot favorites.  Morris' career numbers are quite good, and worthy of HOF\n"consideration".  \n	Ryan?  Of course, but be careful.  I guarantee you that someone will\nthrow back your earlier logic about "Yount and Smith being shortstops who \nhung around a long time".  After all, Nolan never won a Cy...  Damn, he's \njust pitcher who hung around for 99 years...  His W-L record is mediocre...\n(Of course, Nolan's a HOF'er...)\n	Puck?  Probably, although he's got to play reasonably well for a few\nmore years (10 years, even good ones, aren't enough to make the HOF, most\nlikely).  That said, I believe Puckett WILL make the HOF, pretty much\nregardless of how the rest of his career turns out (barring something REALLY \ntragic or sudden).  He's very popular in the media and with fans, and\nlegitimately has been one of the best CF's in the game since he joined the\nleague.  I've always liked the guy, and I hope he does make it.  And, in the\nend, I think the Puck will make it in.  But, really, it's too early to sell.\n\n	This debate comes up rather frequently on the net, and, believe it \nor not, I never tire of it.  It's an interesting subject.  Here's an off\nthe top of my head list of potential HOF'ers from each team.  I probably\nleft a couple of guys off, so feel free to follow up.  I won't consider ANYONE\nwho started playing after about 1985 (again, too early to tell.) [Note: these\nare all active players, I'm not counting recent retirees]\n\nBaltimore:  Cal Ripken (should be a lock by now, even if Gehrig's record stands)\nBoston: Roger Clemens (might be a lock already, which is amazing), Dawson (?)\nDetroit: Alan Trammell and Lou Whitaker (possibilities)\nMilwaukee: Robin Yount (discussed earlier)\nNew York: Wade Boggs (possibly), Mattingly (long shot)\nToronto: Paul Molitor and Jack Morris (possibilities)\n\nKansas City: George Brett (lock)\nMinnesota: Kirby (too early to tell), Winfield (lock)\nOakland: Eckersley (lock), McGwire (too early), Rickey (lock), Welch (LONG shot)\nTexas: The Mighty Nolan [Too early to consider Canseco or Strange :-)]\n\nCubs: Sandberg (lock)\nSt. Louis: Ozzie (lock), Lee Smith (probably)\nNew York: Murray (almost a lock), Saberhagen (obviously, he's got to regain\n				  	      past form)\n[And most certainly, NOT Vince Coleman, despite what he'll tell you :-)]\n\nLos Angeles: Butler, Strawberry, and Hershiser are all long shots.\nSan Diego: Tony Gwynn (pretty good shot)\nColorado: Dale Murphy (a good shot), Ryan Bowen (just to see if you're awake)\n\n	[Before I get flames: this is an off-the-top-of-the-head list, there's\nprobably a few deserving candidates that I left off, and, I didn't include\nBarry Bonds, Will Clark, Any Atlanta Starting Pitcher, Frank Thomas, Canseco,\nMcGriff, etc. because I only considered guys who started playing before\n1985)]\n\n	E-mail or post, I almost fear what I may have started here...

Let's see... April 15th... less than 30 at bats.... and you claim that he \nhasn't done too much so far!\n\nCut this guy some slack. Danny will produce this year. It's scary to think\njust how much he'll produce if he were to stay healthy all year.\n\nThe Yanks have a lot going for them this year: good starting rotation, good\nbullpen, good defense and a good lineup. Also, I like Buck Showalter. Frank\nHoward on 1st is also a good move. Everything sounds good so far. \n\nIf the Yanks stay healthy, they have a good chance at winning the pennant. This \nis the most fun I've had watching the Yanks since "78!
Today, Frank Viola and rest of pitcher staff of Boston Red Sox shutout Chicago\nWhite Sox 4-0.  It is Red Sox 9th win of this season.

Has David Wells landed with a team yet?  I'd think the Tigers with their \nanemic pitching would grab this guy pronto!
I Love it how all of these people are "blaming" the Phillies success \non a weak division.  Why don't we look at the record of the teams in \neach division (READ: Inter-Divisional Play), we'll see that the East \nis really kicking the shit out of the West.  I know it is early, but \nthat is all we have to go on.  Atlanta is just so strong with their \n.188 BA, Cincinnati is 2-7 coming off a sweep at Veteran's Stadium in \nPhiladelphia, and Houston was swept in it's first three games by the \nPhillies in the Astrodome.  That, my Western Division friends, shows \nthat the three best teams in your division may not be as strong as you \nthink!!\n\nPHILS ALL THE WAY IN '93\nBRAVES HIT LIKE A AAA CLUB\nREDS NEED MARGE

BO JACKSON 1963          \n  1988 KCR    437  106  16   4  23   28   29   7  .253   67  .243  .288  .455\n  1989 KCR    517  134  19   5  33   41   27  10  .274   92  .259  .314  .507\n  1990 KCR    405  110  17   1  27   44   16   9  .286   77  .272  .343  .519\n  1991 CWS     71   16   3   0   3   12    0   1  .240   10  .225  .337  .394\n    MAJ      1430  366  55  10  86  125   72  27  .270  246  .256  .316  .489\n    MAJ       598  153  23   4  36   52   30  11\n\nThis is what Jackson looked like in 88-91, with everything converted\nto a neutral park, on the basis of run production. His equivalent\naverage started at .253 in 88, was up to .274 in 89 and 286 in 90. So\nlet us say he had established, in his last two seasons, a .280 level\nof play.\n\nThat is good. Very good, in fact. But it probably doesn't make the top\nten in the league. The 10th best EQA in the AL in 1992 was Dave\nWinfield's .296; Thomas was first at .350. First in the NL was Bonds,\nan incroyable .378; tenth was Bip Roberts, .297. But .280 is better\nthan any season in the past five years by Joe Carter; it is about what\nMattingly had in 1988 (.285); what Felix Jose had the last two years;\njust ahead of Time Raines' five-year average; better than Ryan\nKlesko's MLEs. \n\nHe got more attention from the media than was warranted from his\nbaseball playing, though; his hype was a lot better than his hitting.\nThat is the basis for the net.comments about him being overrated. The\nmedia would have you beleive he was a great hitter. I think he was a\ngood, maybe very good hitter. He was IMO, something like the 30th best\nhitter in the majors.

I thought Bill James' latest book completely and totally sucked.  I bought\nit, but will not purchase anything of his ever again without THOROUGHLY\nlooking at it first.  What tripe.\n\nThe book is inconsistent, and filled with selective analysis.  James\nclaims to be looking forward, and then makes some absolutely bizarre\nstatements of value.  Not only that, but I got the impression he\nprobably glanced at the book for about an hour before he put his name\non it. \n\nTo say I was disappointed is a grand understatement.
Do you really have *that* much information on him?  Really?\n\n\nI don't know.  You tell me.  What percentage of players reach or \nexceed their MLE's *in their rookie season*?  We're talking about\n1993, you know.\n\n\nIf that were your purpose, maybe.  Offerman spent 1992 getting \nacclimated, if you will.  The Dodgers as a team paid a big price\nthat season.  Perhaps they will reap the benefits down the road.\nDo you really think they would have done what they did if they\nwere competing for a pennant?\n\n\nFor a stat-head, I'm amazed that you put any credence in spring\ntraining.  Did you notice who he got those 10 (!) hits off of, or\nare you going to tell me that it doesn't make a difference?\n\n\nWait a minute.  I missed something here.  First, forget Keith\nMitchell.  Are you saying that a kid who moves from AA to AAA\nand then does not improve would have been better off making a\ndirect leap to the majors?  If a player does well at AA and then\ndoes not improve at AAA, isn't that a sign that maybe he doesn't\nbelong in the bigs?\n\nNow, Keith Mitchell.  As I recall (no stat books handy - surprise!)\nhe jumped from AA to Atlanta in 1991.  He did so well that he was\nreturned to the minors, where he didn't do very well at all.  Now\nhis career is in jeopardy.  So how does he fit in with your \npoint.  Good MLE's in AA.  Moved him right to the big club.  Now\nhe's one step away from being traded or moved out of baseball.\nDuh.\n\n\n\nWell, I've cast my lot.  Certainly you may understand better how \ngood Lopez is.  And I may overvalue experience.  But neither one\nof us runs a baseball team.\n\n\n\n--	The Beastmaster
The O's just lost to the Rangers a few minutes ago I was not too happy about\nthe pitching of Rick Sutcliffe (6 runs in 6 innings, 5 in the 3?) This puts\nme in remembering the 1990 O's season. After '89 we didn't do much over\nwinter and we wound up in 5th. Now I know that Mussina, McDonald, and Rhodes\nare better pitching prospects than Ballard and Milacki but are any other\nOriole fans scared out there?\n\nAdmiral Steve C. Liu

And thus, we come to one of the true beauties of baseball; these things, along\nwith many others will never be separated. Almost *everything* in baseball is\nsituational and interdependent. This is what allows us to carry on all the\narguments that we have. If everything could be explained and balanced on a\nstatistical basis, none of the wonder and mystery would be left. Why we might\nhave to resort to just going out the ballyard and enjoy the game itself.\n\n--->Paul, feeling a little anti-stathead today\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n           We will stretch no farm animal beyond its natural length\n\n  paula@koufax.cv.hp.com   Paul Andresen  Hewlett-Packard  (503)-750-3511
I'd be willing to make two wagers:\n1) Snow doesn't win ROY.\n2) Mattingly is out of baseball within five years.\n\nI'm skeptical of the first, because I don't think Snow is that good a\nplayer, and he is on a losing team.\n\nI'm skeptical of the second because of his back.  Mattingly is 32 this\nyear, and how many players play until they are 40?  Not too many, and\nmost of them didn't have chronic back problems when they were 32.\n\nCould be wrong on either or both, but I think that's the smart way to\nbet...
I think he just wanted to get Henneman some work, because the \nTigers had days off both the day before and the day after.
Right.  So who cares which PLAYER gets credited, as long as the TEAM\ngets more runs?  If a player helps the TEAM get more R and RBI, but \ndoesn't score them all himself, who cares?\n\nConsider:\n\nPlayer A: single.\nPlayer B: grounder to short; reaches on the force at 2nd.\nPlayer C: Double, B to 3rd.\nPlayer D: Sac fly.\n\nB gets a run, D gets an RBI.  Are you *sure* they helped the team\nmore than A and C?  Think hard, now.\n\n\nAs you wish.

I like Alomar.  But I'd like to differ with your opinion about "a city\nwhich is likely to pour in the votes...".\n\nI attended many games last year during the balloting.  I know that a\ngreat number of the attendees DID NOT fill out their ballots, but left\nthem, beer soaked and torn on the floor of the stands.  Toronto gets\nno more and no less votes than any other city for the All Star game.\n\nUnfortunately, this is not a one time thing.  I've attended games\nduring the last four seasons, and it has happened every time.  The\napathetic attitude to All Star ballots really offends me.

Davis will be paid by three clubs this year, I think the Phils are\nresponsbible for about $600,000 or so.  They didn't wait for him to clear\nwaivers as three other clubs were also very interested in him.  A gamble?\nYes.\n\nWon the CY Young, too, for that year.
Mark Singer brings up the Strawberry Incident, where he lost a homerun\nand the fan caught it.\n\n\nYes, I think he should have done more to get out of the way.  As much\nas fans want to catch a ball, they really should be aware that winning\nthe game is more important.  As a Dodger fan, he has to be aware that\nthis is the home stadium, and that entails helping the home team win\nin any way possible.  As soon as the ball was hit that far, his first\ninstinct should be to root for Darryl to catch it, not to try to catch\nit himself, particularly when he is sitting that close.\n\nI enjoy the attitude of the Wrigley fans, where they are against \nvisiting team home runs so much, they actually throw them back on the\nfield.\n\nNow, this has nothing to do with whether Darryl could have caught it or\nnot.  Sure, he probably screwed up, but the fan should realize his\nfirst responsibility is to get out of the way and help the team win.
I was on vacation all last week and didn't see any news at all. Could\nsomebody fill me in on how St. Louis ended up with Mark Whiten in a \ntrade? Who did we give up Arocha, Allen Watson, Dmitri Young, or did\nDal make a decent deal?\n\n:

Oh... I forgot... Art Shamsky, former Red and Mets player.  Batted .301\nbetween injuries in 1969 (fell short of qualifying for Top 10 because of\ninjuries and platoon with Ron Swoboda; no Swobo wasn't Jewish).

Lou wanted Morris all along.  The idiot.  Giving the man $40 million\nto play with is like giving a five year old a loaded Uzi with the\nsafety off.  The only question is how many shots he will get off\nbefore somebody is wise enough to take it away.\n\n\nI don't see why people expect Boston to finish sixth.  The bottom four\nteams last year were essentially tied.  Boston, in seventh place, had\n73 wins.  The Yankees and Indians, tied for fourth place, had 76 wins.\n\nNow I should think it is obvious that the Red Sox improved more than\nthe Indians or Tigers.  Basically, the Red Sox are stronger this year\nat 1B, DH, SS, LF, and RF.  They have healthier starting pitchers (so\nfar, at least) and better relievers.  I see no reason why they\nshouldn't win ~85 games.  Meanwhile, the Indians are in shambles and\nthe Tigers *still* have no pitching.  They will win some 20-3\nblowouts, but they will lose an awful lot of 7-5 games too.\n\n*MAYBE* the Sox will play poorly, win 78 games, and finish fifth.\nBut I think third or fourth place is more likely.
Does anyone know where Billy Taylor is?  Richmond or Syracuse?  He was taken\nby the Jays in the Rule V draft, but not kept on the roster.

I suppose a foul ball machine (like Brett Butler) is pretty valuable,\n   but I'd rather watch (and root for) the lower OBP guys who can\n   actually hit the ball.\n\nAnd I'd rather watch (and root for) a team that scores lots of runs\nand wins games.\n\nOf course, I'm rooting for the Rockies and Andres anyway.  But that's\nfor irrational hometown reaons.  I also root for Frank Thomas. :)
The runner can leave his base at any time.  If the ball is caught,\nhe's got to tag up.  If it isn't caught, he _doesn't_ have to tag up at\nall.  So, if he's feeling lucky, your runner at second can sprint for glory\nas soon as the ball is popped up.  If it isn't caught, he's probably scored\na run.  If it is, he's probably headed for AAA.  \n\n	The only effect the infield fly has is to make the batter out,\nthereby removing the force on the runners on base.  All other rules apply,\nas if you were standing second with first open and the ball is popped up.
Sorry, but this is the biggest load of bunk I've seen in a while. \na) The Pirates have been trying to trade LaValliere for some time now.\nNobody was even vaguely interested.\nb) Several other teams had made it known that they would grab Prince,\nwho was out of options.\nc) LaValliere's release had nothing to do with him being through. He\nwas released, because, in the event of an injury to Slaught,\nLaValliere is no longer capable (they believe) of being the everyday\ncatcher.\n\nSince Slaught is as good against righties as he is against lefties,\nthe offense should actually improve with this move.
Now, on the other hand, Juan Gonzales probably DOES have a shot at\n324 HR's.  ;).\n\n\n\n\n\nActually, you might be underpredicting?  ;)\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\nEric Roush		fierkelab@	bchm.biochem.duke.edu\n"I am a Marxist, of the Groucho sort"\nGrafitti, Paris, 1968\n\nTANSTAAFL!

I'm looking for software (hopefully free and runs on Unix box) which will\nkeep track of statistics for my company softball team (batting avg. etc.).\n\nIf you know of any please post or respond to me by e-mail. Many thanks.
Except for the fact that there seems to be a lot of high scoring AL\ngames also and I don't think the expansion teams directly affect them.\n\nK.

Actually, they're pretty worthless, if you want to evaluate players\nwith stats.  RBIs and Runs Scored should be banned; all they do is\nconfuse victims of mediot brainwashing like yourself.  \n\n  You\n\n\nUh, so?\n\nYou've just explained why we use OBP and SLG to evaluate players.\nPrecisely because the team that scores more runs wins the game.\nTraditional baseball stats have gotten way too far away from methods\nwhich enable fans to see who contributes to those runs scored - that's\nwhere OBP, SLG, Runs Created, Linear Weights, etc. come in.  These\nsimplify matters so that we can more easily measure a player's\noffensive contribution to the team's runs scored.\n\nThank you for making our case.  Have a nice day.
Hank Greenberg would have to be the most famous, because his Jewish\nfaith actually affected his play. (missing late season or was it world\nseries games because of Yom Kippur)

But why would you want to use RBI?   RBI is an attempt to measure is some\ncombination of clutch hitting and power hitting.  If you believe in\nclutch hitting, then look at how the guy hit with RISP.  If you want to\nsee how good of a slugger he is, then look at his slugging average.  \n\nIn terms of evaluating players, RBI totals are better than nothing.  But\nwhy use them when so many better stats are out there?
Just a few lines about my favorite team sweeping the Dodgers (one of \nmy least favorite) in LA (Sweet!).  Also the Mets (my other least \nfavorite team) loss to the Rockies made this this a great day and a \ngreat start to the weekend as the Cardinals are on the ESPN tonight.\n\nBig Lee Smith is having a great start and the Cardinals seem to be\nhitting in the clutch even though they have had a few games with lots\nof hits and not many runs.  Hopefully with the coaches stress on\nsituational hitting in spring training, the runners LOB will be lower\nthis year (probably due to the high strikeout numbers by Jose and\nLankford and Zeile's off year).\n\nI don't know why all the fuss about the Fillies.  The media and all the \nFilly fans on r.s.b forget who is right behind them in the standings.  \nGive the Wild Thing a week or two before he starts blowing some games \nand we'll see who is in first then.  I believe the Cardinal pitching \nstaff is more complete than the Filly staff and that will make the\ndifference.\n\nOn a side note, a few years ago (5-6), a comment was made by some \nbaseball player or manager about the Dodger defense.  He was asked \nwhere to hit the ball against the Dodgers and he replied "Fair."  I \nremember it being in the "They Said It" section of Sports Illustrated.\nI would like to know who said it and what issue it was in.\n\nGO REDBIRDS!!
Maybe I can help you. He's a major league coach with the Rockies.\nSo above prediction is doubly wrong.\n\nMy prediction: The Red Sox-Cubs Series and Vikings-Broncos SuperBore will\noccur at the end of the world.\n\nAnd one Rockie will finish in the top 10 of an offensive catagory this \nyear.\n\nAnd no Rockie starter will have an ERA below 3.50.\n\nAnd the Rangers fade will not begin until...August. They'll give way\nto the Angels. But still challenge to the end.\n\nReally. Not making any of this up. If I am, may God strike me down *ZZZZZZT*

Hrm. Sandy Alomar, 24 year old rookie: 132 games, .290/.326/.418. Threw\nout a few baserunners. Benito Santiago, 22 year old rookie: 146 games,\n.300/.324/.467. He threw out a few baserunners, too. Ivan Rodriguez,\n*20* year old rookies: 88 games, .264/.276/.354. Didn't exactly suck\nbehind the plate.\n\n\nTrue. Which only makes it more important to realize when you have one of the\nfew. Lopez' season last year, adjusted to major league equivalencies, was\n.306/.330/.472, 15 HRs. How bad does he have to be behind the plate for that\nto not be better than Olson's .238/.316/.328?\n\n Mike Jones | AIX High-End Development | mjones@donald.aix.kingston.ibm.com

Well, the Red Sox have apparenly resigned Herm Winningham to a AAA contract.\nTed "Larry" Simmons signed him to a AAA contract then released him from\nBuffalo, allowing Lou "Curly" Gorman to circumvent the rule about not\nresigning free agents until May 1. Clearly, neither of these guys is bright\nenough to be Moe.\n\n Mike Jones | AIX High-End Development | mjones@donald.aix.kingston.ibm.com
That's very true.  I live in Richmond, home of the AAA Richmond\nBraves, and they have this guy Ryan Klesko who hit 17 HR's at home\nlast year.  Now that doesn't sound like a whole lot, BUT the way the\n"Diamond" is built, Home runs are a rarity.   In fact, Ron Gant,\nBrian Hunter and David Justice all proved they could hit in\nRichmond.  When they were sent to the majors, they never came back.\nIf you can hit in Richmond, you can hit anywhere.
: In any case, I think Viola would have made a better signing.  Why?\n: Viola is younger, and is left handed (how many left handed starters does\n: Toronto have?\n\nWell, I agree that Viola is a better signing.  However, why does\neveryone say that you want lefthanded starters?  I understand lefthanded\nspot relievers, even though they usually face more righthanded batters\nthan lefthanded batters.  I just don't understand why people insist\non lefthanded starters, unless there is a park effect (e.g., Yankee Stadium).\nMost batters in MLB are righthanded, so righthanded starters will have\nthe platoon advantage more often than lefthanded starters.\nI guess one argument for lefty starters is that certain teams\nmay be more vulnerable to LHP's than RHP's.  However, this is probably\nonly a factor in the postseason, because teams seldom juggle their starters\nfor this reason during the regular season.\n\nI think you just want the best starters you can get, regardless of\nwhether they are lefties or righties.  Lefthanded starters tend to have\nhigher ERA's than righthanded starters, precisely because managers\ngo out of their way to start inferior lefties (or perhaps because of\nthe platoon advantage).\n\nAm I missing something here?
So, if the Braves run production falls to 1 per game, which is\ncertainly where it's headed (if they're lucky), does that mean they'll finish\nfirst?
Yah.  So?\n\n\nHe certainly didn't earn his last one.  *HOW* many games did he blow\nin the World Series?  All of the ones he started?\n\n\nOh, yes.  Definitely.  Therefore Morris is better than Clemens.\n\nDon't give me that shit.  If Boston had Alomar, Olerud, Henke, and\nWard while Toronto had Rivera, Jack Clark, Jeff Reardon, things would\nhave looked a little different last fall.  Give credit where credit is\ndue.  This lavishing of praise on Morris makes me sick.\n\n\nI'm willing to bet they don't finish sixth.  I'm also willing to bet\nthey don't finish first.  And if you give me 3-2 odds, I'm willing to\nbet that they finish ahead of the Blue Jays.

Would you say the same thing about the Dodgers in '65 or '66?  True,\nCone is probably as good as Drysdale, and they have no Koufax, but still,\nthese teams were winning with home run leaders who had very bad totals, with\nlots of low-scoring games, etc.  And they didn't use relievers, whereas\nJeff Montgomery is having a super season for them.\n     That being said, I still picked them 5th or so, but I think a superb\npitching team can win if they have enough hitting.  There's more of a\nchance of that, I think, than of a team with tremendous hitting but no\npitching.  At least, to me.\n     I wonder, though - which one do you people think would do better - a team\nwith Johnson, Koufax in his prime, Seaver, Carlton, and Young, in no real\norder, as the starters, with Sutter, Fingers, and Lyle in the bullpen, but\nwith a puny offense (assuming good defense, like Mazeroski, Maranville, etc.)\nOr a team with poor pitching, but with an offense of Cobb, Carew, Ruth, Gehrig,\nMays, Schmidt, Wagner, and Bench - again,you pick the order.\n     I would postulate that the pitching one would be several games better by\nseasons' end.  Even the best hitters can succeed only 2/5 of the time in\ntheir best years, but a great pitcher can throw lots of shutouts - taking all\nthe players in their prime, they might throw 50 shutouts in a year.  And all\nthe offense would have to do is get 1 run across.\n     I wonder if someone with Stratomatic or something could plug such all-\ntime teams into a regular season, have it played, and report the results\nI would love to see that.
Maybe I'm just a child of the 80's, but I really liked the Marlins' uniforms.\nThe helmets shine nicely in the sun.  It's enough to make me a fan.

I basically agree, the Tigers are my favorite team.  Actually, their\npitching might actually be better this year than last (not that htat's\nsaying a hole lot). How 'bout that home opener on Tuesday!! By the way,\nSparky goes for win 2,000 today.
Um, surely you didn't intend to compare the '93 Reds with the\n29 Philidelphia A's.  The Yankees were finishing 2nd to\na team that was as good as the 26-28 Yankees, while the\nYankees had aged some from their peak years.  Ruth and Gehrig\ncouldn't play every position simultaneously.\n\nIMO, given the various ages of the Braves and Reds this season,\nthat the Braves will be closer to their peak, while the Reds\nhave slightly passed their peak.\n\nAlso, if you're going to compare Braves and Yankees, a more appropriate\ncomparison to the '93 Braves might be the '23 Yankees.  \nAfter falling short two years in a row in exciting World Series,\n both teams won/will win the Series this year, despite the\nheroics of some old fart on the other team. \n(Casey Stengel/ Dave Winfield???)\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\nEric Roush		fierkelab@	bchm.biochem.duke.edu\n"I am a Marxist, of the Groucho sort"\nGrafitti, Paris, 1968\n\nTANSTAAFL!

About as good as Mussina's. better than Sutcliffe's and McDonald's\n\nHe's in the bullpen. Steinbrenner is in charge after all.\n\n\nHe's got the talent to be the 4th starter now, and evetually the ace.\nHe was a higher ranked (and generally better) prospect than Arthur\nRhodes who happens to be, well hey, the Oriole's 4th starter.\n\n\nAs for Militello, it's still early.
And you wrote an *excellent* report about it.\n\n\n\n\nI understand (from an unreliable source) that Canseco was considered\nexpendable by the A's when he refused to accept any coaching about\nhis batting stance.  The A's brain trust came to believe that his\nback problems were exacerbated, if not caused, by having a wide open\nstance, closing it quickly and then swinging with a lot of torque\n(that's a paraphrase of what I remember).\n\nIn any event, Canseco took the road that he and he alone would decide\nhis stance, and the A's began to believe that he would either reinjure\nhimself or begin to lose his ability to hit for both average and power.\n\n\n\n\nApparently, you sound like LaRussa.\n\n\nThe A's also objected about this.\n\n\n\nAgain, I'm just repeating something I heard.

NPR's Morning Edition aired a report this morning (4/19) on\n	Hispanic/Latin American players in MLB and how they have many of\n	the same problems faced by black/negro/African American players\n	when they first entered the league.  However, although baseball\n	has adjusted to the presence of black players, many Hispanic\n	players still labor under the stereotype of being "fireballs,\n	hot blooded, flashy".  The report also emphasised that despite\n	the rantings (my word) of Jessie Jackson about baseballs\n	discrimination against black players in its upper echelons,\n	baseball has actually done much better by black players than\n	Hispanic players.\n\n	Another interesting point was the language barrier problem.  The\n	reporter elaborated on an interview with Ruben Sierra which he\n	gave in Spanish to a Spanish speaking newspaper reporter with\n	the fact that there are maybe 2 major baseball writers that\n	speak Spanish, despite the fact that Spanish is one of (if not\n	the) easiest languages to learn, so easy that the author Cormac\n	McCarthy learned Spanish at age 50 in order to research his\n	book, _All The Pretty Horses_.  Yet, few MLB organizations\n	employ Spanish speaking personel, one of the exceptions being\n	the Oakland A's.\n\n	Another point:\n\n	Nearly 90% of Latin American players have some African blood.\n	Yet, most report that they'd never really felt black until\n	playing ball in the US.\n\n  \n	Ironically enough, it is the early presence of Latin American\n	baseball players in the Major Leagues that support the idea that\n	baseball was integrated before the arrival of Jackie Robinson,\n	as many "light black" or "brown", Latin Americans were\n	incorporated into baseball. \n\n	/S

are you serious? pitchers are pinch-hit for in the nl.  they are not in the\nnl.  if a pitcher is cranking in the al, he will stay in the game.  if he\nis cranking in the nl, he may not - ESPECIALLY if it's a pitchers' duel,\nand his team needs an extra run.
Depends on what you mean by "for a living".  1974 was the year he led the\nleague in pinch-hit at bats with 50, but he'd been getting a lot of PH ABs\nearlier than that, and was never a full-time player.  20-35 PH ABs early in\nhis career, 15-20 a year just before going to the Dodgers, and 30-50 in the\npeak years.\n\nWe're talking about a guy with a 20-year career as an outfielder, a .300+\ncareer batting average, and 1130 or so career hits.
Methinks you recall wrong. Mitchell hit close to .300 in Atlanta and \ncontinued to walk alot after his promotion. He was then (I think) left\noff the playoff roster, and started the next year in the minors where\neven the Braves will tell you he underperformed because he was so mad\nat going back down. \n\nhe struggled last year, no doubt, but even the Braves blamed part of it\non the demotion. I'd much rather have Mitchell than say Mark Whiten on\nthe Cards.

It's always possible, but if this is the case, I think that there is some\nblatant discrimination going on here.

He's been playing horrible defense. Baylor said after Wednesday's game that\nhe wanted to shake up the lineup a little, because Bichette has been\nhaving a rough time defensively and Jerald Clark has not been hitting.\nHe was true to his word; I went to Thursday's game and Gerald Young\nwas in right and Daryl Boston (who has a very hot bat) was in left.\nBaylor was careful to say though that he didn't necessarily mean for\nthese changes to be permanent but he wanted to give these other two\na shot while Clark and Bichette were not playing well.\n\nIn defense of Bichette, it looks like right field in Mile High Stadium\nis a bitch to play. Some of the visiting outfielders have been having\nsome problems too (although Bobby Bonilla made a great catch crashing into\nthe wall to rob Daryl Boston of an extra base hit in Thursday's game)

Oops!  I came across this file from last year.  Thought you might\nenjoy some of these thoughts.  The predictions were made on the\ndate indicated.  They are largely out of order.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nJune 11, 1992\ntedward@cs.cornell.edu (ME!)\n\n\nYou all know how things turned out.  The Orioles, Red Sox, and Yankees\nall disappeared.  The Jays and Tigers continued at essentially the\nexpected pace.  The Brewers and Indians cranked in the second half.\n\nThe Rangers predictably took a dive.  That shouldn't have surprised\nanybody.  Meanwhile, as predicted, the Mariners dropped behind the\nAngels and Royals.  They clearly didn't deserve the 22-33 record in\nJune.  The White Sox and A's upped their game a bit, while the Twins\ndropped off a little.  But for the most part things were as expected.\n\nOkay, so there were a few blatant errors.  But for a predictive\ncalculation, I thought this did pretty well.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFrom CAVGEOE@YaleVM.YCC.Yale.Edu Tue Mar 31 16:36:34 1992\n\nHm.

Wrong on Bream and Mitchell.  A bit early on\nLonnie, as with Bielecki.  Didn't pick Sanders.  (Did anybody? :-)\n\n\nThree of them went, right?

No cigar.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nSome predictions need no introduction!\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nSometimes us statheads get lucky.

I wouldn't give baserunning that much value.\n\nThe above effect is clear, but there are other effects as well.  If\nOlerud hits a double, any runner on first will score; if Alomar legs an\nextra base onto a hit in the gap, the runner on first may need to hold\nat third.  Thus Olerud's doubles have more advancement value than\nAlomar's.  (Of course, Alomar is more likely to score after hitting a\ndouble.)\n\nAnother reason not to give too much extra value to baserunning is that\nthe runs created formulas work for very fast and very slow teams.  No\nteam in the 1950's ran much, but some teams certainly had faster players\nthan others.  Still, the current runs created formulas work just as well\nin the 1950's for all teams.  \n\nBill James gives the 1955-1958 Senators as an example.  They used Harmon\nKillebrew regularly as a pinch runner, and in 1957, stole 13 bases with\n38 times caught stealing.  Yet they scored slightly more runs than\npredicted by Runs Created.
Bob, I think that Stark does this sort of thing as a joke, not as a\nserious prediction.  I don't really see why we should shoot him for\nthat.  The guys who ought to be shot are the ones who keep claiming\nhow great the Royals' chances are in the AL West, since all evidence\nindicates that they aren't joking and actually believe it.

Just curious if anyone has started to standout early in the season in the\nBB DDD this year. I expect the Phillies staff, while getting the wins,\nwould have to rank up there. Luis Gonzalez and Derrick May are among\nthe early league leaders, and all 6 of their bombs have come at the\nPhils' expense. Neither of them have exactly been know for their tater\nprowess in the past. \n\nHow have the Rockies been early? I know Mile High has produced a ton of \nruns, but is it the launching pad everyone expected yet? \n\nA concerned fan of the BB DDD,
These people were very silly.  Any team that gets to the World Series\ncan win the World Series, and anybody who ever expects a sweep is\ncrazy.  If you put the best team in baseball in the Series against\nthe worst team in baseball, the worst team would win at least a game\nmost of the time and very well could win the Series, though the odds\nwould certainly be against them.
Any more news on Steve's status since he lost the starting job\nwould be appreciated
I've noticed that is has become fashionable lately in rsb to predict\nthe Marlines to finish ahead of the Cubs....how?\n\nFirst Base:\n\nGrace vs Destrade...Could Destrade be the second coming of Cecil\nFielder? I doubt it. If Destrade performs to the height of expectations,\nthen even, otherwise, edge to Cubs\n\nSecond Base:\n\nSandberg vs Barberie...No contest. Sandberg will be back May 1. Edge\nto Cubs...a big edge.\n\nShortstop:\n\nVizcaino vs Weiss...Vizcaino is excellent defensively, but is an\nautomatic out at bat. Weiss isn't much better with the stick. Even.\n\nThird Base:\n\nDave Magadan vs Buechelle...Magadan has a higher OBP and is a better hitter.\nBuechelle has more power and is better defensively (I think) Edge to\nFlorida.\n\nCatcher: \n\nSantiago vs Wilkins...Wilkins is OK, but Santiago is better. Edge to\nMarlins\n\nLeft Field:\n\nConine vs Maldonado...Wow! 4 for 4 yesterday...I know Conine has potential.\nI watched him play at Omaha the last couple years. Until he actually proves\nhimself, I give Maldonado the edge, however, like at 1B, this is position\nwhere Florida might be even or better *if* the player there has a huge year.\n\nCenter:\n\nScott Pose vs Wilson/May...Edge to May, even if Wilson. Hopefully the\nCubs will use may and save Wilson for pinch running and the like. May\nisn't Ken Griffey Jr, but he will hit .275 with 15 homers if he plays\nfull time.\n\nRight:\n\nFelix vs Sosa...Felix Jose has occasional power and a bad OBP. So does\nSosa, but Sosa also has speed and a good glove. Edge to Cubs\n\nStarters:\n\nAquino? Armstrong? Hammond? A lot of fifth starters here. The Cubs won't\nremind anyone of the Brave staff, but Morgan-Castillo-Guzman-Hibbard\nis average to OK...better than the Marline. Edge to Cubs\n\nMiddle Relief:\n\nEven. The Cubs have some decent middlemen, and so do the Marlins.\nCarpenter anf Klink or decent, but so are Assenmacher and McElroy.\n\nCloser:\n\nA healthy Harvey is a big edge to the Marlins. Meyers is decent, but\nno Harvey. Of course, the Cubs may have a few more games to save.\nLook for 30 saves, 5 blown from Meyers, and 25 saves, 3 blown (with\na better ERA) for Harvey. Edge Florida.\n\nOverall, an edge to Chicago.\nNeither of these teams will threaten to win anything, of course.\ne\n--\nmsilverm@nyx.cs.du.edu				GO CUBS!!!

Need some pitching help, fast!\n\nGood news, though, is that Hurst has been throwing curveballs\nw/o any pain.  Threw 80 pitches yesterday.  Should be back\nin a couple of weeks.

Another word (offense) makes them my pick for last too.\n(Well, there's also my policy of never picking a Buck Rodgers' team for last)\n\n\nThe 1961 Angels were  1/2 game out of 7th. The Athletics and \nexpansion Senators finished tied for last. \nThe 1962 Colt 45's finshed 8th - ahead of the Cubs (the Mets were last).\nThe 1969 Royals finshed 4th - ahead of the White Sox (the Pilots in last).\nThe 1977 Mariners finished 6th - ahead of the Athletics(in last).\n\nApparently being an expansion team with a poor A's or Chicago \nteam around is a `good thing'\n\n\nThis may be an appropriate comparison.\nThe 1929-31 Yankees finshed 2nd, 3rd and 2nd finshing \n18, 16 and 13-1/2 games out of first. \nIn 1933,'34 and '35 they also finished second ( though they were only\n7, 7 and 3 games out).\nEven great teams can lose - That's why they play the season.\n(on the other hand... I'm still picking the Braves to go all the way)
Bunker & McNally were later.\n\nPappas, Estrada, Steve Barber, and . . . ?
I haven't been following the previous HR's.  But there are two, that I saw\nlive that would have to be up there (up where? there!).  \n1) Rick Monday's HR to bury the Expos in the NL championship in 1981.\nIt was hit off Steve Rogers, who is a RHP and primarily a starter.\nWhy was he used as a reliever when the 'Spos had Reardon and BillLee\nwarming up in the bullpen.  Considering Monday couldn't touch LHP,\nLee would have been a safe bet.  He wasn't even doing any drugs at that\ntime (or so he told me and around 50 others on a recent venture into \nMontreal.  The blast wasn't the important aspect.  It was the timing.\nSeventh game, a tie game, and in the top of the 9th.  The Expos almost\ncame back though...\n2) Mike Schmidt hit one that killed the Expos in 1980.  So close, yet, so\nfar.\nand\n3) Strawberry killed a pitch on the second day of the season a couple of\nyears ago.  It went off the technical ring in the Big O.  It almost left\nthe stadium!  That was hit HARD!!!\n				CorelMARK!
Do you realize that the yankees are paying Matt Nokes 2,500,000 dollars  \nthis year!!!! GEESH. And Maas only gets 125,000.    \n\n\n\nBy the way, the yankees are going to WIN IT ALL\n\n\nYankees are the BEST.
Me too!  I would like any park or action gif or jpeg about baseball.
Educate yourself before you rip on this years manager of the year.\nLankford injured himself in a previous game and Torre was resting\nhim.\n\nAs far as the Whitten/Gilkey controversy.  Whitten adds some more\nneeded power, and if Jordan continues to hit the way he has been,\nGilkey will find himself in the starting lineup soon enough.\n\nSam
How many runs will be scored in Denver?\nI don't know.\n\nbut some idea can be gotten by looking at the runs scored in \nMile High Stadium during the last few years of the Bears/Zephyrs \ntenure in the American Association.\n\nHere's the total runs scored per game in Zephyrs games, \nall league games and the ratio. I found the same ratios for HR.\n\nYear  rpg   lea  ratio  hrpg lea ratio   \n1992 10.22  9.10 1.12   1.65 1.58 1.04\n1991  9.53  8.87 1.07   1.41 1.26 1.12\n1990 10.71  8.72 1.23   1.49 1.24 1.20\n1989  9.07  8.34 1.09   1.27 1.11 1.14\n1988  9.90  8.37 1.18   1.29 1.08 1.19\n1987 12.55 10.70 1.17   2.39 1.92 1.24\n1986  9.45  9.33 1.01   1.35 1.38  .98\n1985  9.50  8.54 1.11   1.53 1.34 1.14\n1984  9.99  9.10 1.10   1.55 1.59  .97\n1983 10.60  9.99 1.06   2.03 1.74 1.17\n1982 11.29 10.35 1.09   2.24 1.91 1.17\n1981 10.29  9.25 1.11   1.43 1.49  .96\n1980 10.59  9.43 1.12   1.63 1.46 1.12\n      1446/13-->1.11     1444/13-->1.11\n\nIt seems pretty clear that Denver will have a large effect \non runs scored (I'll stick with my prediction from last year \nthat it'll be one of the top 3 in the NL this year) \nand a fairly large effect on Homeruns - though apparently not as large as \nAtlanta, Wrigley, Cincinnati and San Diego.\nStill it ought to be a pretty decent home run park.
"Todd Karlin" writes\n\nBonilla wasn't threatening anyone.  He just wanted to give him the dollar \ntour.  =^)
Yeah, but what's your point?  You still need the offense to score more runs\nthan you allow, too.  \n\nThe Braves do have a fine pitching staff.  But that's still only half the\ngame.

The New York talk shows are just awful in this regard.  People are constantly\ncalling WFAN and WABC with (stuff like) "I was thinking, why don't the Yankees\ntrade Kaminicki and Silvestri to Seattle for Ken Griffey Jr and Randy Johnson,\nthat would really help the team"  or "Do you think the Yankees can get Roger \nClemens?".  The show hosts are pretty good about handling these guys, but it's\nstill annoying.\n\nThe best one was at the end of one show, a caller started out with "I was \nthinking, why don't the Yankees trade for..." and then the host hung up on\nhim.  I cheered!
I would e-mail this to you, but my mailserver doesn't recognize you or\nsomething.\n\nAnyway, the worst pitcher on the Yanks. If you mean currently on the team,\nthen I have to go with Scott "I'm a schizophrenic...No, I'm NOT!"\nKamienicki. Sure, occasionally the guy can pitch well for 5 or 6 innings,\nbut then he starts to go insane. A sure sign that he's losing his stuff\n(and his mind) is when he starts to stalk around the mound between batters\nand yell at himself.\n\nThe worst all-time Yanks pitcher?  Gotta go with Ed "New York? I have to\npitch in [gulp] New York?" Whitson. 'Nuff said!\n\n\n--I'm outta here like Vladimir!\n-Alan Sepinwall XVIII
Did he ever really convert?  He married a Jewish woman, but I've never\nheard him say he converted.  Elliot Maddox, on the other hand...\n\n\n\nYep, Holtzman.  Saul Rogovin won an ERA title in 1949 or so before blowing out\nthe arm.\n\n\nI'd be surprised.  btw, they may just be shopping Gallego around to\nmake room for AS.
Unfortunately, you seem to lack the ability to rate players.  Dave\nWinfield has had a better career than half the people in the Hall of\nFame.  Eddie Murray and Darrel Evans are both one of the top 100 players\nof all time.  Lee Smith has had probably the greatest long career\nof any relief pitcher since 1960, with the possible exception of Gossage.\n\nOn the other hand, Kingman probably isn't one of the best 750 players\nof all time.\n\nAnd Reardon, though a good pitcher, isn't in Smith's class career wise.\n\n\n\nWe're talking 2 of the top 50 players of all time here.  There probably\naren't 5 shortstops in history who were better than these two.\n\n\nGarvey sucked.  Morris, while a very good pitcher, simply doesn't\nbelong near Cooperstown.\n\n Gee, can these guys even compare to\n\nIf Puckett and Ryan (okay, no if there) get into to the Hall, they will be \nmarginal Hall of Famers (unless Puckett keeps hitting like he did last year for\na while longer)\n\nTo put this in perspective, here's a listing of the linear weights\nvalues of the careers of the players you mention.  In parenthesis\nis how high they are up on the greatest ever list if they make it.\nWhile no one would claim these are perfect rankings, they should give\nyou a good value of these guys' careers as compared to average players.\n\nRobin Yount 43.0 (41)\nOzzie Smith 42.1 (45)\nDave Winfield 40.3 (53)\nEddie Murray 37.5 (68)\nDarrel Evans 35.2 (80)\nKirby Puckett 24.3 (180)\nNolan Ryan 21.6 (219)\nJack Morris 11.8 (478)\nDave Kingman 0.4 \nSteve Garvey -5.8\n\nTo give you an idea of how these numbers compare to those in the Hall:\nOf the 71 eligible players whose career stats equaled 35.0, 64 are in the Hall\nof Fame.

I've been a Giants season ticket holder for years and never really complained\nabout the old ballyard place. Sure, it's been cold, the food lines were long,\nand the hired hands were surly, but this was all part of the Giants mystique.\nOr so I thought.\n\nI went to Tuesday's game (3 - 1 Giants over the Marlins) and the 'Stick was \na much different place. Nothing short of a dome will eliminate the wind, but \neverything is a lot better. The lines are a lot shorter, the bathrooms are\nCLEAN and have running water, and the hired hands were very polite. \n\nThe new foghorn (lights up and blows after each homerun) and the wooden fence\nare very nice, as are the new bleachers. The bleachers start right at the top\nof the fence and give a great view, and they've got beer stands at the\nbottome of the bleachers. The only complaint is that the electronic \nold-fashioned scoreboard looks electronic - could be better.\n\nThese things should have been done a long time ago, but it took a real \nbusinessman (ex - Safeway President Peter Magowan) to figure it out. Just \nlike he used to tell his checkers, "If the customers don't come back, I don't\nneed as many checkers". This isn't a knock on Bob Lurie - he was a competent\nbusinessman but he didn't deal much with the general public.\n\nI'll give an example of how the level of service has changed. The onion \ndispenser jammed as I was using it. An attendant came over, apoligized for\nthe problem and proceeded to fix the machine. After he was done, he cleaned\nthe machine and said he was glad to be able to help. In the old days, there\nwas no attendant and the folks at the concession stands would say "Go to\nthe stand 100 feet away - they might be able to help".\n\nAll in all, it was a fun day

Al Weiss played second for the White Sox in the early sixties, chiefly as\nback up to Don Buford. Good glove, no hit, some spunk.\n\n(Which reminds me: do they still serve Kosher hot dogs at the new Comiskey?)
Wetteland is on the DL effective March 26 or something like that.
I thought that was Sandy Koufax.
hmm - i thought francesca's predictions ALWAYS hovered at or below\n .500, especially in the nfl.  (not counting college football\n bowl day).\n\nhe's a nice analyst for explaining past tense, and for mapping out\n what plays teams might do - but for predicting the future, he only\n looks good whne compared to russo.
This is the crux of the argument (to me at least).  Both the\nSDCN and the non-SDCN camps seem to agree on the fact that a catcher's\ndefense is basically nonmeasurable at present.  You can talk about how\nimportant calling a game is, or framing the pitches, or blocking balls\nin the dirt.  But there is little or no way to tell exactly how various\ncatcher's rank in "defense".  \n\n	Looking at Lopez specifically; is there any reason to suspect\nthat he is a bad defensive catcher other then the fact that the Braves\n(or the media) has labeled him a bad defensive catcher?  As far as I\ncan tell he doesn't have any particular problem in his mechanics\n(such as Sasser).  He might be a little rough around the edges in blocking\nthe ball, or framing the pitch to get a good call but all he needs to\nclear that up is playing and practice time.  I can't see how repetitions\nat AAA are any better then reps in the majors!  \n\n	All we're left with is the calling the game aspect.  Olsen  and\nBerryhill at always given credit for calling good games and helping\nthe pitchering staff.  But this is a reputation that is given to almost\nall veteran catchers.  How is catching at AAA going to help Lopez learn\nthe major league pitching staff?  The only way any catcher is going to\nlearn Tom Glavine's pitches is to catch Tom Glavine.  Similarly, I wouldn't\nbe supprised if the pitcher's claimed to prefer pitching to Olsen over\npitching to Lopez because they are used to pitching to Olsen.  But \ngiven time they will say they are comfortable with Lopez.\n\n	Now, since Lopez can't learn how to handle the major league\npitcher's while he's in AAA and since he doesn't have any glaring\nproblem in his mechanics, what is he going to learn in AAA that he\ncan't learn just as well while in the majors?
KC(?) news was doing a report on that.  They said that McRae is\nreally a batting coach and not a manager.  But for some reason\nhe took the job.  Whatever the reason, the Royals need a new\nmanager now...while it is too late.
Hi all,\n\nI've been locked in a small closet chained to a lab bench for the last week or\ntwo without access to really important information.  I saw the 3.5 million\nshoulder back on the DL--How long is he out for (i.e. How many millions/inning\nwill he get this year?)  Nothing personal against Higuera mind you, just\nwondering how Bud can keep coffing up money for him when he lets current\nbig producers go over a relative pittance. (Please realize the term \n"relative pittance" can only be used with sarcasm when discussing baseball\nsalaries.)\n\nAdditional questions:  I did'nt get to see Bones pitch this spring--how is\nhe looking and where is he going to fit in the rotation?\n\nHow is Surhoff shaping up defensively at third?\n\nAre they going to build a new stadium?  When?
jayson stark (i trhink that's him) fits perfectly in this category.\n\nanyone who writes "dean palmer has 2 homers  - at this pace, he'll\n have 324 home runs!" should be shot.\n\nif, at the end of april, he has 11, and anyone writes "at this\n pace, he'll have 100+ homers!" they shouldbe shot too.
Probably because everyone (that is, everyone who has cable) can watch\nevery Braves game. They are the only team that has all of its games\nbroadcast nationwide. And if you don't like your local team, or you don't\nhave a local team, the Braves can kind of become your local team because\nyou can watch them every day.\n\n\n--I'm outta here like Vladimir!\n-Alan
Hmmm...what about walks and SB? Baerga got clobbered by Alomar in OBP and\nbeat him in SLG by a lesser margin. Even putting aside any other factors,\na player with a 51 point edge in OBP is more productive than a player with\na 28 point edge in SLG. The issue has been studied before, and I doubt you\ncould come up with any convincing argument the other way.\n People see the batting average and the HR, but they don't really know  \ntheir value is worth unless they've studied the issue closely. The fact is that\nBaerga ate up a LOT more outs than Alomar; while Baerga was making outs,\nAlomar was drawing walks and being on base for Carter, Winfield et.al.
I had heard the rumors about LA, Cin, Hou, and SD all being\ninterested in Mark Davis, so it doesn't surprise me that a\nteam had to give up something and cash to actually get him.\n\nLynch "MOB"
Sorry Len, this is exactly how he suffered from being rushed to the bigs.\nBeing overweight and having no work ethic, leading to being injury prone with\nnothing to loose, might have been corrected in Richmond.  (Did you intend a \nsmiley after your comment?)\n\nThis brings back the long suffering memories of pre-chop Braves fans who\nkept being promised the Bob Horner - Dale Murphy back to back power slam.  Who\ncould stop that?  Guess we'll never know.\n\nP.S. - Rocky fans (are there any yet?)  Is Dale getting any playing time out\nthere?  I plan to be at the game on June 28th, they'll have to play him then.
Ted, you're missing a vital point.  As Roger Lustig pointed out in a\nprevious response, the reason why Schott was banned from baseball was\nbecause she had been known to call and think in a racially biased manner on\na constant basis.  Such thoughts affected her hiring practices.  Bonilla,\non the other hand, was found to have mentioned this one word a single time.\n If he had been known to go around, criticizing homosexuals, it would be a\ndifferent story.  Furthermore, he is merely an athlete.  He doesn't have to\nhire anyone as Schott had to do.  Dave Pallone, the former NL umpire who is\nan admitted homosexual, has decided to assist in a protest before a Mets\ngame at Shea.  He, like you, thinks that Bonilla should be suspended from\nbaseball.  Pallone is hoping for a year's suspension.  In my opinion,\nthat's downright ludicrous.  As Howie Rose on WFAN said, if you start\nsuspending athletes who have mentioned a derogatory word even a single time\nunder whatever conditions, then you'd probably have enough people remaining\nto play a three-on-three game.  Now, honestly, if you truly analyze the\ndifferences between the two cases that you bring up in your article, I\nwould think that you'd reconsider your thoughts.\n\n\n                                    -Sean
Walt Weiss tripled just barely inside the right field line and into the\ncorner, driving in Santiago and Conine.  These were the first two\nRBIs.  The third came later when Weiss was knocked in.
too bad he doesn't bring the ability to hit, pitch, field or run.
Greetings baseballers, \n\n	I have a choice of two more or less identical conferences to\nattend, one in \nDenver, and one in Dallas, both May 24-28.

B.S. about darkness deleted.\n	nope The Royals are the only team in the majors that have not\n     finished in last place.    ^^^^    Of course this doesn't include \n     the marlins and the rockies but they have a good chance at \n     finishing last also.

I'm confused.  How is it Hal McRae's fault that he can't win with a team \nwhose best offensive player is Phil Hiatt?  I mean, let's be real.  Kansas\nCity will have to get outstanding years from their entire staff just to end\nup near .500; they have less offense than any other team in baseball, even\nif you count the expansion teams.
Here's one I remember: (sort of)\nYogi's asleep in a hotel room late at night and gets a call from someone.\nAfter he answers the phone the person at the other end asks if he woke Yogi\nup. Yogi answered, "No, the phone did."
I just wanted to let everyone know that I have lost what little respect I have\nfor Jim LeFebvre after seeing today's Cubs game. First of all how could he\nstart Maldonado over May. After the way May played at the end of last year and\nthe way he tore up the Cactus League how could you let him sit the bench? Not\nto mention that a right hander (Maddux) started. I really blew my top when\nLefebvre pinch hit for Rick Wilkins with TOMMY SHIELDS! How can you do that\njust because of the lefty-righty thing, too much is made of that. Wilkins is\ntwice the hitter that Shields is. Then the next batter was Jose Vizcaino, one\nof the weakest hitters I have ever seen, and who had looked terrible at bat all\nday, and Lefebre let him hit, while May still sat the bench. I think even Arnie\nHarris was stunned by this because he showed May sitting in the dugout while\nVizcaino was batting. Face it Lefebvre has got to be the worst manager in\nbaseball.\n						A dishard Cub fan
And some comments, with some players deleted.\n\n\nYep, that Kevin Mitchell.  I never would have expected him in the\n#1 spot.\n\nIt's no accident that the first two names are 1988 only.  As with first\nand second base, 1988 was the year of the glove.  Average DA was 20 points\nhigher in both leagues than any other year.\n\nLooks good.  Too bad he's moving to short.\n\nHighest five-year regular, though he's only had one year as good as Kevin\nMitchell :->.\n\nThe other elite fielders in the league.\n\nThis is an interesting line.  His 1988 figure was slightly below average.\nHis 1990 was pathetic, and his 1991 was the next best year by anybody.  Part of\nthat may be his mobility.  1988 was with the Yankees.  1990 was with the\nPadres, who appear to have a rotten infield.  1991 was with the Twins, and\njudging by Leius and Gaetti, the Metrodome may be a good place to play\nthird.\n\nAdd another to the elite fielders list.\n\nToo fielders whose career average may overstate their value.  I don't know\nwhat happened to Caminiti -- judging by the three previous years, his low\n1992 may be a fluke.  Sabo is merely average, however.  His incredible 1988\n(best year ever) brings his average up a lot.\n\nStrange last two years.\n\nAccording to reputation, one of the best fielders ever at third base.\nBut at the end, he was below average.  (Average in 1988 was .643).\n\nBoggs has been pretty good.  I don't know what happened in 1990, but every\nother year he has been above average, usually by quite a bit.\n\nLast year -- a fluke or a portent?\n\nWhy is it that the two leagues usually have defensive averages very close\nto one another, but very different from year to year?  Any ideas?\n\nBrook  is declining.\n\nThree first-time regulars, above average in 1992.  I'm not sure why Jefferies\ngets all the grief about his fielding.  He's never had a good year, but while\nat second he improved to become an average fielder, and is an average fielder\nat third.\n\nZeile, on the other hand, is a below average fielder.  Each year he's about\n10 points below average.  And it's probably not just the park, since Terry\nPendleton had excellent DAs in the three years before this.\n\nMoving back to second was a good idea.\n\nSo why is Hayes supposed to be good defensively?  He's had a grand total\nof one year above the league DA, and was pretty bad last year.\n\nHoward Johnson and Carney Lansford -- separated at birth.  To his credit,\nHoJo did have one above average year (1990).  Lansford couldn't even break\nthe .600 mark without the help of the year of the glove.\n\nGood hitter, but his fielding needs work.\n\nNot a good fielder.\n\nBoth are better off at shortstop.\n\nTwo consecutive horrible years for Leo.  Camden Yards doesn't seem to\nhave helped his fielding any.  \n\nTexas slugger debuts with not only the lowest career DA, but the lowest\nDA at third ever.  Congratulations, Dean.\n-- \nDale J.

Woof woof!
I'm not quite sure how these numbers are generated.  It appears that in\na neutral park Bo's HR and slugging tend to drop (he actually loses two\nhome runs).  Or do they?  What is "equivalent average?"\n\nOne thing, when looking at Bo's stats, is that you can see that KC took\naway some homers.  Normally, you expect some would-be homers to go for\ndoubles or triples in big parks, or to be caught, and for that matter you\nexpect lots of doubles and triples anyway.  But Bo, despite his speed, \nhit very few doubles and not that many triples.  So I would expect his\nvalue to have risen quite considerably in a neutral park.  \n\n\nFelix Jose has been a .350/.440 player in a fairly neutral park.\nI would offhand guess the `89-`90 Bo at around a .330/.530 player.\nMaybe .330/.550 .  Not even close.\n\n\nI'd put him about there too.  \n\nNote: I hadn't realized the media had hyped him so much.  I thought he\nwas always viewed by them as a better football player, and only so-so \nat baseball.  He did only have one 30-hr, 100-rbi season, and KC wasn't\nwinning.\n\nNote 2: I maybe have harped on this a bit in the past, but there is a\nmistake being made (by the SDCN's, as they are known, on this group)\nwith respect to players like Bo and Deion and Lofton (and perhaps others).\n\nWe find, that if you look at a large group of players, their past major\nand minor league numbers will predict their future numbers fairly well.\nTheir are some caveats: the younger they are, the less good the prediction;\nthe lower the minor league, the less good (I imagine), the more recent\nthe player has left college ball, etc.\n\nNow of course, this prediction involves quite a bit of "error."  Sometimes\na player with poor MLE's (Dave Justice, the 1990 Ventura) becomes a star.\nSome hitters develop (Shane Mack, Brian Downing), some don't (Oddibe\nMcDowell, Mickey Brantley).  This error involves real things: there are\nreal reasons why Oddibe didn't hit and Shane did.  It may (who knows)\ninvolve parks and batting coaches and wheaties and injuries and lifting\nand so on.\n\nBut still, you have this big pool of players, and things work pretty well.\nOne of the reasons for these predictions accuracy is the common background\nof the players.  One thing we know about professional baseball players is\nthat all of them (or almost all) have spent a good deal of time playing\nball.  Their backgrounds are similar.\n\nWhat hasn't been established is what happens when you encounter a player\nwith a different background?  Is there some reason to believe that a\nBo, or a Deion, or a Lofton, or a Tony Gwynn (?), or an Ainge, or so\non, has such a different background, that the standard model and standard\nassumptions fit this person slowly?\n\nIt hasn't been established that you can use MLE's with two-sport players.\n(It hasn't been established that you can't, but then statistics is, after\nall, an art).  I personally think otherwise lucid individuals continually\nmake completely nonsensical statements about Bo and Deion and Lofton.\n"Look at those good-but-not-great minor league numbers," they say.  Well,\nwhat happens if those numbers simply don't mean what they usually mean?\nIt might mean that Ken Lofton suddenly has a better year in Houston than\nTuscon.  It might mean that Deion suddenly has a better half-year in\nAtlanta than Greenville.  \n\nThen again, it might not.  Ken and Deion might go right back in the tank\nthis year, live up to those poor MLE's.  But you guys DON'T KNOW.  What's \nworse, you don't know that you don't.  And you don't know that there are \nother players you won't know about -- injuries and lifting and wheaties \nagain.  You seem to think that the model is perfect and eternal.  It's not.\nIt's got some error.\n\nOh well.\n\nBill Guilford
Since someone brought up sports radio, howabout sportswriting???\n\n(Anyone give an opinion) \n\nWhich city do you think has the best sports coverage in terms of\nprint media? \n\n(these are general questions) \n\nIs the Washington Post better than the Philadelphia Inquier or the NY\nTimes?  \n\nHowabout the Philadelphia Daily News compared to the New York Daily\nNews?
Well, had you been a bit less exuberant in both the tone and substance of\nyour predictions, the responses would probably have been a bit more\nmeasured. Be that as it may....\n\nClemens is always in this form, and Viola isn't really performing beyond\nwhat might reasonably have been expected. How do you know that the Sox are\nresponding to them, and not to Al Bumbry, Hobson, or (my most likely\nsuspect) new hitting coach Mike Easler? I certainly am more likely to give\nEasler credit for Mo Vaughhn's hot start than Clemens or Viola.\n\nThis was the optimistic scenario, but not unreasonably so. He hasn't shown\nmuch power yet, though.\n\nHow can you tell that Dawson is providing the leadership? Perhaps it's\nCalderon? Perhaps it's Clemens and Viola? Maybe Hobson is finally showing\nthose people skills he was supposed to have when they hired him. Or maybe\nit's all a myth. And Dawson has been hitting reasonably well, but not as\nwell as Greenwell, Vaughn, Cooper, or Fletcher.\n\nIn three games. Why don't we look at this one again in, say, July?\n\nA bit better than could reasonably have been expected. But don't forget that\nZupcic looked like Wade Boggs lite for about 75 AB's last year. Beware of\nsmall sample sizes. Still, if Fletcher hits as well as he did last year he'd\nbe a great improvement over any Sox leadoff hitter from last year. Be aware\nthat his career numbers seem to indicate that he puts up good numbers as\nlong as he doesn't have to make more than 300 AB or so in a year.\n\nUmmm...sorry, no. I can buy the "in the field" part, and I think he'll be\nbetter at the plate than the 1992 Boggs, but in general Cooper, while he'll\nbe a pretty good hitter, couldn't carry Boggs' jockstrap. With a little\nluck, he could be the fourth or fifth best 3B in the AL (Martinez, Boggs,\nVentura, and Palmer will all be better).\n\n\nSee, here is where you make that quick left turn off into the aether. .500\nis plausible, third is not unlikely, but phrases like "could run away with\nthe division" are likely to get you a visit from the men in the white\ncoats. It's not really clear that their staff is better than last year. If\nRussell does well, Darwin doesn't go on the DL, and Hesketh doesn't pitch\njust barely well enough to avoid losing his spot in the rotation, they could\nbe better. On the other hand, if Hesketh pitches miserably and they're too\nstupid to move him to the pen and bring up Conroy or somebody, Fossas\ncontinues to pitch dismally but they keep giving him innings becasue he's a\nlefty, and Russell explodes they could be pretty bad.\n\n Mike Jones | AIX High-End Development | mjones@donald.aix.kingston.ibm.com

Joe Torre has to be the worst manager in baseball.\n\nFor anyone who didn't see Sunday's game,\n\nWith a right hander pitching he decides to bench Lankform, a left handed\nhitter and play jordan and gilkey, both right handers.\n\nLater, in the ninth inning with the bases loaded and two outs he puts\nlankford, a 300 hitter with power in as a pinch runner and uses Luis\nAlicea, a 250 hitter with no power as a pinch hitter.

I believe that Rusty Staub was also a jewish ball-player\nAlso, Mordaci Brown back in the early 20th century.  He was a pitcher whose\nnickname was "3 fingers" Brown....for obvious reasons....he had 3 fingers.

It's not a cliche, and (unlike your comments below) it's not a tautology.\nIt needn't have been true.  If every pitcher in baseball were essentially\nthe same in quality (i.e. if the variance of pitching ability were much\nsmaller than the variance of batting ability), then scoring runs would be\nmuch more important than preventing them, simply because the *ability* to\nactively prevent runs would be much weaker.\n\n\nIf that's your point, you should have said so.  What you in fact said was\n"Pitching and defense win championships", and later "Pitching is the essence\nof baseball".  Neither of which says what you are now claiming was "your \npoint", and neither of which is true.\n\n\nAnd you accuse Sherri of mouthing cliches!?\n\n\nIt's not clear to me at all that this is true.  In high-scoring games, the\nteam with the better offense wins a high percentage of the time.  In low-\nscoring games, the split is essentially 50/50 regardless of team ability.\n\n\nI thought you said "pitching and defense win championships" and "pitching is\nthe essence of baseball".

As far as I know, Toronto, Pittsburgh, and New York (NL) change their\nuniforms every year.

Can anybody name a player who was 'rushed' to the majors (let's, for\nargument's sake, define "rushed" as brought up to the majors for more than\na cup of coffee prior at age 22 or younger, and performing below\nexpectations), whose career was damaged by this rushing?  I'm serious; I\ntend to agree with David that bringing the player up sooner is better, but\nI'd like to look at players for whom this theory didn't work, if there are\nany.  I'd prefer players within the last 10 years or so, because then I can\nlook up their minor league stats.  (It's important to distinguish between\nplayers who legitimately had careers below what their minor league numbers\nwould have projected, as opposed to players who were hyped and failed, but\nactually had careers not out of line with their minor league numbers).  \n\nLet's kick it off with an example of a player who was "rushed", although\nthere doesn't seem to have been any damage to his career.  Jay Bell was\ngiven 135 PAs in the major leagues at age 21, and performed well below what\nyou would expect from his AAA numbers the same season.  He got 236 PAs the\nnext year at age 22, and still underperformed.  However, the next year, at\nage 24, his performance improved, and he won the everyday shortstop job,\nand has been there ever since.  It's really hard for me to see where he\nwould have been better off staying in the minor league (where he was\nperformed quite well in AAA) during this time, rather than being "rushed";\nCleveland might have been better off, I suppose, because they might have\nbeen less likely to give up on him.\n\nYes, if you bring a player up early, he's likely going to struggle.  But\ndoes that delay the time at which he stops struggling, and starts\nperforming up to expectations?
Maybe because baseball is the only business where those who are\nresponsible for the fiscal aspects of the game preach gloom and doom. \nThese allegedly intelligent people seem to predict bad times, losing\nmoney, bankruptcies at an alarming rate, and there's going to be an\nincreased degradation of the product they produce.  Could you imagine\nIBM, with all their problems, promoting themselves the way Major League\nBaseball does?  Their stock would plummet to unthinkable depths (not\nthat they are too far from it now :-).  What would happen at GM?  Where\nwould GM be if they admitted to cutting corners and producing an\ninferior product because of alleged labor problems? I think it shows a\nlack of confidence for the people who run the game.\n\n\nForget it.  Word has it three divisions with a wild card is just about\na done deal.  It has to be decided soon since negotiations with the\nnetworks also have to begin soon.
That's might be what it takes to beat the Braves this year.
Can anybody figure out why some box score abbreviations make\nabsolutely no sense?  (At least in the local Gannett rag that finds its way\nto my door.)  I must have stared at "Cleman" in the Mets' box for a\ngood 30 seconds this morning wondering who the hell it was.  Wouldn't\nit make more sense to use "Colemn"?
I doubt Henderson would clear waivers.  And if he did, he would\ninstantly be signed for the major league minimum, with Oakland picking\nup the remaining $3 million tab.\n\nSome GMs value on-field performance too...
Once, on Jeopardy, the category was "Jewish Sports Heros," believe it\nor not.  The answer was, "This pitcher had four no-hitters with the\nDodgers in the 60s."  The contestant said, "Who is Hank Aaron?" Alex\nTrebek said something like, "I don't think Hank Aaron was a pitcher."
I personally will never forget Mike Schmidt's home run against the\nExpos in 1980 that decided the NL East.  It was also his career high\n48th.

Geez.  Everyone comes up with Clark, Williams, Thompson.  These guys\nwere all up in 1987.  That's ancient history.  So in the last 6 years,\nnoone, right?  Beck doesn't count.  I said 2 solid years.\n\n\nLet's see what he does w/o the help of a pitchout every other pitch.\nAs I remember, even Bob Brenly had a good throwout percentage under\nRoger Craig, who loved to sacrifice the count for runners being thrown\nout.  Of course, he suffered from 3 ball 1 strike homers a lot too.\nI am not a big fan of Manwaring.

One last infield fly question that has always puzzled me and hasn't\nyet been addressed.  I believe the rule also does *not* deal with this\nsituation:\n\nIf Infield Fly is declared and the ball is caught, runners can tag up\nand advance at their own risk, as on any fly ball.\n\nHowever, if the Infield Fly is *not* caught, at what point can a\nrunner legally leave his base w/o fear of being doubled off for\nadvancing too early?  When the\nball hits the ground?  When a fielder first touches the ball after it\nhits the ground?\n\nEnlightenment would be appreciated.
Not clear to me at all.  I'd certainly rather have a team who was winning\n4-1 games than 2-1 games.  In the 2-1 game, luck is going to play a much\nbigger role than in the 4-1 game.
The tribe will be in town from April 16 to the 19th.\nThere are ALWAYS tickets available!

This was (my opinion) the stupidest thing in the Hidden Game. The\nargument was\n\n1) Defense, or runs allowed, is 50% of the game.\n2) Unearned runs amount to 12% of the runs allowed; earned runs, 88%.\n\n3) Since unearned runs are the result of fielding, not pitching, and\nearned runs are the product of pitching, not fielding, fielding is 12%\nof defense and pitching is 88% of defense.\n4) Caombining with #1, pitching is 44% of the game, fielding 6%.\n\nPete is usually sharper than that. My own feel is that fielding is in\nthe 25-33% of defense range; call it 30-70 between fielding and\npitching.\n\n\nI'd give baserunning a little more credit than that, maybe 45-5, or\neven 40-10. Give a team of Roberto Alomar and a team of John Oleruds\nidentical batting stats (which wouldn't be that unreasonable), and\neven if you don't let Roberto steal a single base, they'll score a lot\nmore than the Oleruds by going first-to-third more often. (No offense,\nGordon).
I don't know if you could call him rushed, but "Big" Ben McDonald didn't\nmuch time at all in the minors. Of course that was because the balls used\nin AAA had seams too large and gave McDonald blisters forcing him to go\non the DL several times. He's done most of his learning here in the majors.\nOf course Gregg "Wild Thing" Olson and Mike "Deserved a Cy Young" Mussina\ndidn't spend much time in the minors either. I read somewhere that pitchers\nare less likely to need that much time in the minors anyway so maybe that\nhas something to do with it.\nLet's go O's!

Um, what?  Eddie Murray was a superb first baseman for a *long* time.\n\nWinfield as produced consistently for almsot 20 years, and excellently\non several occasions.  \n\nDave Kingman's *best* year was like Darryl Strawberry's *typical*\nyear with the Mets.  \n\nDarrell Evans, too, did a whole lot more than just hit homers, which \n*is* all that Kong did.  \n\n\n\nWhom are you talking about?  Yes, Eddie Murray is marginal, but that's\nbecause he's 38 years old.  He wasn't marginal for a *long* time.\n\n\n\nNot.  \n\nSmith has hung around for a long time AND fielded the position better \nthan anyone else ever has.\n\nYount stopped being a shortstop about a decade ago, in case you hadn't \nnoticed.\n\nOne of his two MVP awards was as a centerfielder.\n\n\n\nLike whom?  There are many players in the Hall who aren't anywhere near\nas goos as the guys you're running down.\n\n\nThat's already the case, by some standards.  But the *bad* players in the \nHall are all from the 20's and 30's.  Recent picks have generally been\nexcellent.\n\n\nNo, but who cares?  Was Stan Musial anywhere near as good as Babe Ruth?\nNot really.  But he obviously belongs there.\n\nThe Hall has generally had about the top 1% of major leaguers.  As \nmore players come through the game, more will be in that top 1%.  \n\nAnd, yes, it's pretty easy to argue that Smith,. Yount, Evans, Winfield,\netc. are in the top 1%.  Dave Kingman on the other hand, was a liability\nthroughout most of his career.\n\nOf course, Garvey *hasn't* gotten a lot of HOF press, so I don't know\nwhat you mean.  \n\nAs for Ryan, is his W-L better than Morris'?  That's what a lot of voters\ntend to look at.  And Morris *was* awfully good for a decade, and doesn't\nlead MLB history in walks allowed, either.
There's a lot of whining about how much players are overpaid.  I thought\nI'd put together an underpaid team that could win a pennant.  I splurged\nand let four of the players earn as much as half a million dollars; the\nhighest-paid player is Frank Thomas, at $900K.  I cut some players, like\nKenny Lofton, Chris Hoiles, Keith Mitchell, Tim Wakefield, and a bunch\nof pitchers, all of whom could have arguably made the team better at a\ncost of $1 million for the lot of them.  The total team salary is \n$7,781,500, averaging slightly over $300K a player.  If that's too steep,\nyou can dump Thomas and Bagwell, replacing them with Paul Sorrento and\na minimum wager to save a bit over a million dollars, and still have one\nof the best teams in the majors.\n\np, Juan Guzman, 500\np, Mussina,	400\np, Castillo,    250\np, Eldred,      175\np, Rhodes,	155\np, Militello,   118\nrp, Rojas,	300\nrp, Beck,	250\nrp, Melendez,   235\nrp, Hernandez,	185\nrp, Nied,	150\nc, Rodriguez,	275\nc, Piazza,      126\n1b, Thomas,	900\n1b, Bagwell,    655\n2b, Knoblauch,	500\n2b, Barberie,	190\n3b, Gomez,	312.5\n3b, Palmer,	250\nss, Listach,	350\nss, Pena,	170\nlf, Gonzalez,	525\ncf, Lankford,	290\nrf, R.Sanders,	275\nof, Plantier,	245
But good ones can collapse somewhat, then come back the next year.\nBurleigh Grimes went from 20+ wins and an ERA of 3 or so in '24 to 13-19 and\nan ERA around 4 in '25.  He pitched well for several more years.  Carlton\nwon 13 and lost 20 the year after his 27-10 record. (Source: Bill James\nHistorical Baseball Abstract.)\n     And let's not forget John Tudor, who started 1-5 and finished 21-6 in\n1985.  He had a pretty bad ERA when you take Busch Stadium into account at\nthe start of the season.\n\n\n     If I recall, he had a 4.50 ERA in the 1st half and a 3.50 ERA in the\n2nd half of last year.  \n     Hmmm, 21 runs in 11 innings.  Suppose he starts 30 more games, and winds\nup w/200 innings pitched.  If he allows 4 runs a game in the next 189\ninnings, he'll have a 4.75 ERA or so at the end of the year. (I think I have\nhis totals right.) This is going to be hard to come back from.\n\n\n     My 1st hunch is that Morris is very gutsy, and that he may be pitching\nthrough an injury and not telling anyone.  My 2nd guess is that he will be\nbanished to the bullpen the remainder of the season after a few more starts.\n(Perhaps when Stewart comes off the DL?  Or will Danny Cox, who went 3 or 4\nscoreless innings against the Tribe today, start for Morris?  He looks like\na really good one.  Gaston is scrambling to find starters, I'd imagine.\nLuckily, the Jays have a very good offense.)\n     I don't think they would dare release him before the end of the year.\nHe'll just be replaced by Stewart or Cox.
That's because Lankford had a minor injury from a couple of games\nbefore that\n    and was day-to-day... only available as a pinchrunner.
how do you know this? did lasorda say, before the game, "here's the\nlineup i'm using.  i'm batting strawman fourth because the primadonna\ninsists on batting cleanup"?\n\nif this is true (note that i don't think it is), lasorda should be\nfired for at least two reasons:\n\n         1) publicly humiliating his players;\n         2) knuckling under to his players wishes.\n\nhowever, i think that the more likely explanation is that lasorda\nwanted strawberry to bat fourth, and that you hate strawberry.
If I remember correctly (Which is always in doubt), Horner's signing\nwith the Braves was contingent on starting in Atlanta.  I think\nhe could have gone back to Arizona St. for one more year if he hadn't\nsigned.  Anyhow, the Braves did try to send him to Richmond once;\nit lead to a week-long walkout.  Methinks Horner had no work ethic\nbefore he was drafted, and minor league play wouldn't have helped.\nBut his raw talent would have gotten him into the ML, and it did\nkeep him there for a while, until he started falling on his wrists.
I am looking for a source of American League baseball stats for\nindividual players in the same format as printed in newspapers, ie. I do\nnot want to provide a list of players and get back nice printed reports\nfor $35 a week.\n\nDoes anyone know of such statistics availability and an idea of the\ncost?
My vote goes for the ('75?) Indians with their all-red uniforms.\nBoog Powell once said he felt like a big red blood clot.
Doug, those stats are great!  they help immensely.  I tried to E-Mail\nyou with some comments on them but my mail server does not recognize\nyour address.  Could you E-Mail me with some info on how to get E-Mail\nto you?  Thanks!
Anyone know of a phillies mailing list out there? .... they don't get much\ncoverage up here in Grand Rapids, MI *sob*\n\n--
The Red Sox usually have 2 catchers.  I don't think they have a backup now,\nbut they used to use Randy Kutcher as a backup catcher, as well as a middle\ninfielder and outfielder.  You don't need a good 3rd catcher, just a\ncompetent one, so you can afford to lose a little catching ability and pick\na player who can be of use elsewhere on the field.
Oh, this is an easy trivia question.  The answer is "any Cub not named\nSandberg or Grace."
so you want to decrease players' salaries?\n\nso you want to increase owners' salaries?\n\nthe two are equivalent.
This leads me to believe that it's not really a rabbitball year, and that\nwe've just had a rash of high-scoring games.  I bet this one day's worth\nof games pulled everything back to close to average.\n\nInteresting, because the other day, all but three games had ten or more\nruns scored, and yesterday no game had more than nine.
I was *hoping* somebody would mention clutch.  Clutch?  Baerga?  The\ntwo words simply do not go together.  With runners in scoring\nposition, Baerga batted .308/.366/.418 last year.  This doesn't quite\n*suck*, but most batters hit *better* in this situation.\n\nAlomar?  He hit .354/.439/.517 with runners in scoring position!\n\nThe difference?  Alomar had 68 RBIs in 147 such AB.  Baerga had 81\nRBIs in 182 such AB.  Baerga got 25% more chances, yet succeeded only\n20% more times.\n\nFrankly, I don't believe in clutch.  But if I did, my vote would\ngo to Alomar for MVP (let alone "best 2B in the AL").
The term "stopper" is generally used to refer to a pitcher, one\nwho can be counted on to pitch a strong game to keep his team from going\non a losing streak.\n\n	The Braves have plenty of pitchers to fit this description,\nalthough right now I'd expect Smoltz or Glavine to take the mantle.\n\n	What the Braves lack, however, is an offensive stopper,\nsomebody they can look to to bring them out of their hitting slump.\nThere's just no one there.  The Braves got rid of their best pure\nhitter, Lonnie Smith, and only Terry Pendleton on the current roster\nhas ever shown more than a cursory ability to hit.	\n\n	Oh, and another thing that worries me.  Ron Gant seems to have\nslowed down a step.  That's scary.  A slow Ron Gant doesn't have much going\nfor him.

Why not?  Brooks Robinson is a defensive liability too, and Ted\nWilliams is a weak hitter.  Even great players decline as they age.
Hell, the Orioles' Opening Day game could easily be the largest in history\nif we had a stadium with 80,000 seats. But unfortunely the Yards (a\ndefinitely excellent ballpark) only holds like 45,000 with 275 SRO spots.\nTicket sales for the entire year is moving fast. Bleacher seats are almost\ngone for every game this year. It's a extremely likelyhood that the O's\ncould sell out every game this year (especially if we lead the division for\nmost of the year like '89). \n	On another front, the sale of the Orioles to anyone is likely to be\nforced upon Eli Jacobs who is major debt apparently. Maybe we can get an\nowner willing to spend on a proven rightfielder free agent in the winter.\n	Fernando has made the O's as the fifth starter. The O's pitching\nstaff looks pretty good. Sutcliffe, Mussina, McDonald, Rhodes, and Fernando.\n	Baltimore is my pick for the victors in a very competitive AL East.\n__________________________________________________________________________\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n Second to last day of the season - Gregg (The True Wild Thing) Olson\nuncorks a wild pitch allowing the Blue Jays to tie.

Add Mike Trombley in there somewhere, since they need five people.  Mark\nGuthrie will remain in the bullpen as the long lefty.\n\nPags and Terry Jorgenson will platoon at third, with Reboulet as the\nbackup infielder.  Pags looked pretty miserable yesterday for a guy who\nlead the league in DA in 1991, muffing what should be routine grounders\n(heck, muffing a grounder *I* would probably have gotten to).  Jorgenson\ndid nothing exceptional that I noticed.  Leius missed a ball I *think*\nGagne would have reached; we will certainly miss Gag's glove this season.\n\nHe looked pretty good there.  Contrary to what the mediots have been saying,\nhe looked reasonable at first.  He isn't mid-80s Hrbek, but then neither is\nthe Pretty Big Guy himself any more (note:  I'm used to seeing the Twins\n1B looking kinda big on the field, but not that big!).  If he hits vaguely\nlike last year, he's a perfectly good first baseman.\n\nNote:  Much of this posting is from personal observation yesterday in a game\nwhere the regulars were mostly pulled after several innings.  Winfield may\nhave big holes in his defensive game that didn't show up (he didn't have to\npick any bad throws, for example), but I'll take what I saw so far.
Wow.  ESPN can repeat eleven-year-old Bill James research.  (Literally.\nCheck the 1982 Abstract.)  \n\n\nPerhaps in 2004 they'll be as reliable as an average SDCN.\n\n\nOops, maybe not.
They did.  For $950K.
Is it just me, or does Bichette look totally lost in the outfield?  He \nmisplayed Martinez fly-out into a double against the Expos, misplayed\nAlou's single into a triple (Alou tagged out at 3rd after over-sliding \nthe bag) and now he misplays another out into a 3 run triple...add in his\nwonderful batting average and we have one heck of a player!
I tell you, Steve Stone is like a prophet.\nHe must be making a ton in the boradcoast booth because\nI can't understand why he's not actually back in the game itself.\n\nThe other day he called Sosa's homerun against the Sox and\nclaimed the game would be going into extra innings when the\nscore was 8-3 in the 5th.\n\nSo yesterday he notices that Sosa's ahead in the count against\nMaddux and says, "This is a fastball situation and Sosa will be\nlooking for it.  But this is also the spot where Maddux throws\nthe straight change."   Sure enough. Sosa gets ahead on it and pops\nit up to the infield.\n\nStoney for Cubs manager!
Amusing, isn't it?  Seems only the SDCNs realize how much baseball is\na *team* game, combining efforts from every player for the win.\n\nConsider the Red Sox game last night.  The Sox won 4-3 in the bottom\nof the 13th.  Who won the game?\n\n-Clemens pitched a strong nine (?) innings, allowing only two runs.\n-Ryan pitched a couple shutout innings, though he needed some excellent\n defensive plays behind him to do so.\n-Quantrill pitched a couple of innings, gave up the go-ahead run, and\n got credited with the win when the Sox scored two in the bottom of\n the inning.\n\nLooks like a team effort to me!  Yet only Quantrill got credit for\nthe win.\n\nHow about the offense?\n-Dawson and Vaughn hit (I think) HRs early in the game.  Without either\n one, the Sox would have lost in nine.\n-Quintana led off the 13th with a solid single.\n-Zupcic pinch-ran for Quintana, providing the speed to go from first\n to third when...\n-Cooper ripped a *second* single in the inning.\n-Melvin avoided the DP, getting the run home with a sac fly.  Not much of\n a help, but it was something.\n-Scrub Richardson then hit a double, scoring the speedy Cooper all the\n way from first!  (Hill's lack of defense helped.)\n\nCooper and Zupcic were credited with runs, Melvin and Richardson were\ncredited with RBIs.  But it seems to me that it was Quintana's hit\nthat set up the whole inning!  And did Melvin really contribute as\nmuch as Richardson?\n\nFurthermore, people seem to consider RBIs to be more significant than\nruns.  Did Melvin contribute more than Cooper?  Cooper provided the\ngame-winning baserunner, and moved the tying run to third base with\nonly one out!\n\nAssigning credit based on Runs and RBIs is clearly ridiculous.  You\ncan argue that OBP and SLG don't show you who came through in the\nclutch, but R&RBI don't do any better.  At least OBP and SLG don't\n*claim* to try to tell you that.\n\nHere's to the Red Sox who contributed to last night's victory.\nAll 20 of them!
Both protests would be denied, of course.  The umpire's judgement\ndetermines the garbage thing, although I think the game should be\ncalled (but that's my personal opinion...doesn't matter).  There\nis time only when the ump says, so the second argument is baseless.

Darryl Strawberry's moon shots were fun!  He can hit those high and far\nhome runs that if he actually ran them out he'd be rounding second base\nby the time they landed.  We used to say that he should have to file a\nflight plan at LaGuardia for some of them.  Then _Bull_Durham_ came out\nand that was changed.  :-)\n\nOn homers he pulled that didn't go high, they were microwave home runs.\nMicrowave, as in they got outta there in a hurry!  In a game in 1988, he\ncame off the bench with the flu and on the second pitch send a rocket\ndown the right field line that didn't even allow Bob Murphy the "luxury"\nof a home run call.  The story went he stayed in the clubhouse, the with\nthe Mets down by two and two on Davey Johnson sent for him to pinch hit.\nHe came out of the clubhouse saying "one swing and we go home."  He hit\nthe homer, ran the bases, then went straight for the clubhouse to shower\nand go home.\n\nThose were the days....
Not if you've scored four runs, you don't!  Why strain even the best pitching\nstaff?  Why not make it easier for them?  \n\nIn the 2-1 game, the best pitching staff in the world can't compensate\nfor a blown call, a bad hop, a gust of wind.  Winning close is the \nwrong way to win; both keeping opposing runs down AND scoring a lot \nyourself are insurance against the "Shit happens" aspect of baseball.\n\nNot every great teamhas even *good* pitching.  The Big Red Machine of\nthe 70's was league-average in pitching.  But somehow, Rose-Morgan-Bench-\nPerez-etc. managed to win 100 games more than once, peaking at 108.
Ted Frank's list of underpaid players was this:\n\nWhat do all of these players have in common?  They do not qualify for \narbitration.  They were never free agents.\n\nIt's called the reserve clause.  Look it up.\n\nAnd a year from now we will whine about how several of these guys are way \noverpaid and getting outrageous raises in arb.  Humbug.

I am trying to get a copy of the _official_ rules of baseball.\nSomeone once sent me the ISBN number of it, but I have since lost it.\nCan anyone give me this information, or tell me where I can find the\nbook?  None of my local bookstores have it.
I know.  You have this fucked up idea that anybody who prefers Alomar\nto Baerga must be a Jay-Lover and Indian-Hater.  Sorry, you got that\none wrong!  I hate the Jays and don't care one way or the other about\nthe Indians.  But objectively, Alomar had the better offensive year\nlast year, so I have to pick him.\n\nYou admit T&P as a reliable(?), objective source?  Then you will note\nthat they rated Alomar as the better offensive player, chosing Baerga\nover Alomar only because of his defense.\n\nThat's a joke!  (Alomar might not be a gold-glover, but he's certainly\nno worse than Baerga defensively.)
What's the difference between Nolan Ryan and Yount?  Both have hung\naround for years, and continue to post great stats.  Why shouldn't Dave Kingman\nget into the Hall?  Or Murray, Evens, Reardon, and others?  What the hell do\nyou have to do?  Ask an opposing pitcher whether he thinks that Winfield should\nbe in the hall...  God.  Pretty soon you'll be saying that Cal Ripken doesn't\ndeserve to be in the Hall.  Then, I'll flame you. :-)

Gee, I never knew Valentine made a comment about how Viola signing\nwith Boston was gonna bring a World Series title to Boston.  I don't\nthink Valentine ever said Boston will win this year.  Boy, talk about\nsensitive, insecure Toronto fans.  :)\n\nIn any case, I think Viola would have made a better signing.  Why?\nViola is younger, and is left handed (how many left handed starters does\nToronto have?

:>Does anybody in the Pittsburgh area know why Mike LaValliere was released?\n:>Last year I kept saying that Slaught should get the bulk of the playing time,\n:>that he was clearly the better player at this point, but Leyland insisted on\n:>keeping a pretty strict platoon.  And now he is released?  That doesn't\n:>make any sense to me.\n\nGreg,\n\n    The story goes like this:\n\n       Spanky is too slow!  If he were quicker, he would still be here.\nBut with Slaught and Tom Prince, they didn't want to lose Prince in order\nto bring up that 11th pitcher.  Slaught is about as good as Spanky and\nPrince is coming along nicely!\n\n      Don't feel too bad for him.  He's still gonna get theat $4,000,000\nover the next two years -- he'll be able to do most of what he wants to\ndo.
Finally, an objective source.  Alomar's a great player, but so is Baerga.\nNice to see the objective source cited rather than "my dad's bigger than\nyour dad" posts.
Did anyone notice the words "NOT FOR BASEBALL" printed on the picture\nof Joe Robbie Stadium in the Opening Day season preview section in USA\nToday? Any reason given for this?\n\nAlso, I just noticed something looking at the Nolan Ryan timeline in\nthe preview. On 8/22/89, Rickey Henderson became Nolan's 5000th strikeout.\nOn 6/11/90 he pitched his 6th no-hitter against Oakland. I believe the\nlast out in the game was made by Rickey Henderson. And on 5/1/91, Nolan\npitched his 7th no-hitter on the same day a certain someone stole his\n939th base, which overshadowed it. It seems that Nolan is having a lot of\npublicity at Rickey's expense. IMO, Rickey deserves it, and it seems as\nmost of the net agrees with me from what I've seen on it lately. They are\nboth great players, but IMO, Nolan has outclassed Rickey, both in playing\nand more importantly, in attitude. Just my thoughts.
You can add Steve Rosenberg, one-time White Sox reliever now in the Mets\nsystem, to the list.
Hi, baseball fans! So what do you say? Don't you think he deserves it?\nI\n \nmean, heck, if Dave Winfield (ho-hum) is seriously being considered for it,\nas\n\nis Lee Smith (ha), then why don't we give Dave Kingman a chance? Or Darrell\n\nEvans! Yeah, yeah! After the Hall of Fame takes in them, it can take in\nEddie\n\nMurray and Jeff Reardon.\n\n     Well, in any case, I am sick and tired (mostly sick) of everybody\ngiving\n\nHall of Fame consideration to players that are by today's standards,\nmarginal.\n\nHonestly, Ozzie Smith and Robin Yount don't belong there. They're both\n\nshortstops that just hung around for a long time. Big deal.\n\n     Let's be a little more selective, huh? Stop handing out these honors\nso\n\nliberally. Save them for the guys who really deserve it. Face it, if\nsomething\n\nisn't done, there will be little prestige in the Hall of Fame anymore. When\n\ncertain individuals believe that Steve Garvey or Jack Morris are potential\n\ncandidates, the absurdity is apparent. Gee, can these guys even compare to\n\nthe more likely future Hall of Famers like Kirby Puckett or Nolan Ryan?
I would assume that the words (I saw the picture) indicated that those \nSEATS will not be available for baseball games.  If you look at the picture \nof the diamond in the stadium, in relation to the areas marked "NOT FOR \nBASEBALL", those seats just look terrible for watching baseball.   Now, if \nthey should happen to reach the post-season, I would imagine that they \nwould consider opening some of those seats up, but that is surely a worry \nof the future.\n\n \n\n\nSam Lubchansky          spl2@po.cwru.edu\n\n"In the champion, people see what they'd like to be.  In the loser,\n they see what they actually are, and they treat him with scorn."
I totally agree with each point you made.  Jose Viscaino looked\nlike a single A hitter up there.  Who swings on 3-1 count with Maddux \npitching and your teams down by a run, and you haven't touched the ball all \nday.  I also think too much is made of that lefty-righty thing.  Watching\nthe Cubs games I get the feeling Steve Stone knows a lot more about what\nthe Cubs should be doing than Lefebre does.  Harry said it best when he\nstated after another terrible Vizcaino at bat-- we can't wait til\nSandberg returns!
Interesting article, Craig.  It's amazing how hard it is to get baseball\nteams to understand how to properly market their teams and treat their\ncustomers.  No other business could ever get away with the 19th century \nattitudes that most current owners display in running their clubs.  I guess the\nowners look at baseball's high growth rate and ask why it's necessary\nto bring 20th century business practices into the game, but they don't\nrealize how much more growth the game is capable of and how much they\npay in terms of long-term popularity by not doing better by the game\nand its fans.

briefly, since i'm off to sleep.\n\nmle's work pretty well for AA nd AAA players.\n\nplayers who are 22 and younger will tend to have explosions\n in their numbers, whether mMLE's or not, in the next 2 years...\n\nplayers who are 26 and OLDER, at those levels, generally have\n inflated MLE's.\n\nthey're about as reliable as having major league stats for a player.
Excellent point.  I hope to God that Ted Simmons doesn't get the weird\nidea of trading for the guy.  And if he does, he had better not\ninclude Jeff King in the deal.  Oh God--what if he traded Zane Smith\nand Jeff King for Vaughn and Greg Blosser?  It would be worse than The\nNichols Curse!\n\nHmm, I guess that doesn't sound sincere enough.  Oh well, at least I\ntried...
Don't you GUYS think so?  I mean, c'mon!  What the heck are women doing\neven THINKING of getting into baseball.  They cause so many problems.  Just\nlook at Lisa Olson.  Remember that feisty reporter that entered the New\nEngland Patriots locker room?  She started crying like a LITTLE GIRL!  I\njust don't think women belong in a man's sport.  Before you smart guys\nflame me for this, I know the given example was about football.  Who cares?\n It still applies to other MALE sports.  How can we have women umpires? \nJeez!  Look at Pam Postema.  Just because she's a woman, everybody on the\nface of the earth thinks it's great that she's getting an opportunity to\nump.  If you even watched the games and had an IQ greater than that of\nroast beef, you'd see that she is not nearly as good as most AAA umpires.\nBesides, she is probably more worried about cracking a fingernail with a\nfoul tip off of Wade Boggs' bat. Or Jose Oquendo's bat. Either way, there\nare too many complications.
Actually, I was simply relaying the reasoning of this so-called genius BW\nwriter.  I agree.  The reasoning was foolish.  \n\nNext time, before you say something foolish, be aware what you are responding\nto.
I'd have to say the most impressive HRs I've ever see came from Dave Kingman\nand his infamous moon-raker drives...
Here is the OPI (Offensive Production Index) for all NL players with at\nleast 10 at-bats.\n\nIt is early in the season so there are some high numbers.

In a Philadelphia Inquirer a few days ago, it was reported that there were\ntwo (2) plans for a new Phillies stadium:  the already-mentioned 30th\nStreet Station proposal, and a location near Broad Street and Race Street,\nI think.  I can't remember the exact details, but the stadium would be\nbuild practically downtown.  There is a small lot that could be used,\naccording to the paper.  The 30th street plan has run into some trouble,\nbecause Amtrak does not want to reroute some of its lines in order to\naccomodate the stadium.  I don't have an opinion just yet, just letting\neveryone know that there are really two options being discussed right now.\nNeither of these plans will be put into effect very soon, however, because\nnobody wants to pay for it :-)\n\n--\n    Keith Keller				LET'S GO RANGERS!!!!!\n						LET'S GO QUAKERS!!!!!\n	kkeller@mail.sas.upenn.edu		IVY LEAGUE CHAMPS!!!!
When are the Yankees planning on activating Melido Perez?  His 15 days on\nthe DL are up today, but are they bringing him back this weekend?
I don't personally, but Clay just posted it.  Yes, we do.  \n\nUnfortunately, it shows that Lopez wasn't as good an example as Nieves would\nhave been, since his last year numbers were out of line with the previous\nyears (which I didn't have access to).\n\nThe point remains, though; knowing a guy's minor league history is as good\nas knowing his major league history, if you know how to read it.\n\n\nThe MLE is not a *projection*, it's an *equivalence*.  It's a "this is how\nwell he hit *last* year, in major league terms" rating.  So, in essence, he\nhas *already* reached it.  I would guess (Bob?  Clay?) that essentially half\nof all players surpass their previous MLEs in their rookie seasons.  Maybe\nmore than half, since all of these players are young and improving.\n\n\nDid they?  Offerman may have been the difference between 4th or 5th place\nand last place, but no more.\n\n\nSure; they didn't have anyone better.  I suppose they might have gutted the\nfarm system to acquire Jay Bell or Spike Owen or somebody if they were really\nin contention. \n\n\nIf you'd read what I wrote, you'd be less amazed.  Nowhere do I claim to put\nany credence in spring training.  Quite the contrary; I said that Lopez hadn't\ndone anything that even the bozos who *do* put credence in spring training\ncould interpret as "failure".  Just because I think spring training numbers\nare meaningless doesn't mean that Bobby Cox does; it's just a case of ruling\nout one possible explanation for sending Lopez down.\n\n\nKeith Mitchell did very very well at AA, AAA, and the majors over a season,\nthen did very, very poorly for a year in AAA.
Bo Bilinsky?

I thought that Walt Weiss was jewish.  I seem to recall this\nwas mentioned once while he was still at Oakland.\n\nAlso, I have my suspicions about Esther Canseco (nee Haddad).
I'm not sure I understand this question. When the IF rule is invoked,\nthe batter is automatically out. This relieves the runners from being\nforced to advance to the next base if the ball is not caught. Other\nthan that, isn't it just the same as any situation in which a runner on\na base is not forced to the next base on a dropped fly ball? That is,\nif the ball is caught he can tag up and run (or decide to stay), and\nif the ball is dropped he can have left the base at any time.
The tater that Jack Morris served to Griffey the Younger in his first\nat-bat this year went 394 feet, if I remember right (I'll have to check\nmy scorecard at home).  I think that's the longest so far in the Kingdome\nthrough the first stand (five games) there.  A weak showing, despite some\npromising taterball candidates ... Ben McDonald, Rich DeLucia, and the\nrest of the Mariner bullpen ... making appearances.\n\nAnyone have the tape-measure value for Omar Vizquel's grand slam in the\nSkydome?
Actually I admired the spirit of the fan at the Cubs opener several years\nago who held up a sign that said "Wait Till Next Year".

Owen only has one error so far, I believe.  That seriously\nunderrepresents the harm he has done in the field.\n\nOwen will cleanly play any ball he reaches.  He will have a fine\nfielding percentage, like always.  The problem is that he doesn't\nreach anything that isn't hit straight at him!\n\nThis wouldn't be quite as obvious a problem if he were playing next to\nKelly Gruber or Robin Ventura.  But the third baseman for the Yankees\nis Wade Boggs (who should have moved across the diamond *last* year)!\n\nI've only seen one game, Abbott's first start, but there were three\nballs hit to the left side which would have been stopped by quality\ndefensive players.  Instead they were charged as hits against Abbott.
Since I was the one responsible for these divergent threads of\napprox. 40+ posts (going back to: The Braves could be better off\nif an injury happens), I may as well inject a little more\nfuel to the flame!\n\n1)  Back at the beginning of Spring Training, I though\nLopez would make the squad easily.  Olson was still\nrecovering from his late-season injury (knee, I believe),\nand there were questions as to whether he would be\nable to play before June.  And then Berryhill was dinged up.\n\nI was looking forward to this, because I believe that Lopez\ncan hit AND field the position.  Before last season, he was\nthe Braves "Defensive Catcher" prospect, while Brian Deak was\nthe Braves "Offensive Catcher" prospect.  Besides, Olson\nand Berryhill couldn't hit their way out of a wet cardboard\nbox, and don't walk enough to be useful.\n\nBut Olson recovered quickly, Berryhill recovered, and the Braves went\nwith the two vets.  I still say that if one of those two had been down\nat the start of the season, he wouldn't have gotten his job back.\n\n2)  There is a certain logic to keeping Olson and Berryhill around.\nAfter all, ML catchers are in short supply and suffer from wear and\ntear.  There are teams out there without ONE average ML catcher\n(California and Seattle come to mind).  Certainly, trying to\nmove Olson or Berryhill through waivers would be unlikely to work.\nPlus, you'd have to eat that salary, which isn't huge, but isn't\ntiddleywinks either (I think Olson's at about $800,000, Berryhill\nat $450,000, but that's only what I recall).\n\n3)  Yes, I think arbitration-eligibility may have a role to\nplay in this also.  What is it, that 5/6 of the 2+year players\naren't eligible for arbitration?   Only the 1/6 that were on the roster\nthe longest are eligible?  Of course, the system may change,\nbut the extent of that change is not yet known.  From a business\nstandpoint, it may make sense to keep Lopez down until June/the\nfirst time Olson/Berryhill go on the DL.\n\n4)  I am still disappointed that Lopez isn't on the team.\nI still prefer to think of myself as a fan when it comes to the Braves,\nand the truth is that I'd rather see our best team on the field,\nwhich, IMO, includes Lopez.\n\nOf course,today we play the Cubs.  Hopefully, we won't need him. ;)\n\nAs for the Schuerholz/Cox conversation, I imagine it went\nlike this:  (Remember, they've BOTH been GM's)\n(the following is not meant to be read by the humor-impaired)\n\nCox:  OK, we've sent Jones down.  His fielding could be a\nlittle smoother.  Besides, Blauser can hit OK and his fielding\nis better than it used to be.\n\nSchuerholz:  Well, we'll have to send Nieves down too.  Deion\njust won't sign that baseball only contract.  We can't count\non him in October, so we have to keep Nixon around for the\ndefense.  Besides, Gorman's not ready to give up on\nBilly Hatcher yet.  Once Hatcher's gone AND Deion signs,\nwe can move Nixon for Frankie Rodriguez.  That ought to\ngive us some pitching depth in 1995.\n\nCox:  Yep, that'll be nice.  Too bad Deion won't sign.\nOK, I'll look for Nieves when Justice starts having\nBerry-Berry...er, back problems again.  Now, what about\nKlesko?\n\nSchuerholz:  Well, we've still got to fork out another 1.5 mil\nfor Bream.  If we keep Klesko, we either lose the money\nor Cabrera.  I keep dangling Sid in front of Dal Maxwell,\nbut somehow he doesn't seem to be the same GM.  First\nJeffries for Jose, and now Whiten for Clark!  If he\ngets rid of Brian Jordan, then I'd HAVE to believe that he\nand Whitey Herzog switched bodies at the Winter Meetings!\n\nCox:  OK, keep trying on Bream, and I'll wait til the trading\ndeadline for my Hunter/Klesko platoon.  Maybe I can get a few\nextra at-bats for Cabrera while we wait.  Try California...\nif Snow starts slowly, maybe WhiteyDal will bite on Sid.\nAnd if that doesn't work, then perhaps Sid's knees\ncould be "persuaded" to act up.  There's always the\n15-day DL!  Mwa-ha-ha-ha-ha!\n\nSchuerholz:  What about Caraballo?\n\nCox:  Well, he's not that much better than Lemke.  Maybe if he starts\nin Richmond, he'll start walking more.  Besides, if he's going to be\narbitration-eligible, better to stretch him out so that we actually\nget some value from him before he makes the big bucks.\n\nSchuerholz:  Now, let's see.  That leaves Lopez.\n\nCox:  NOOOOO!  I gotta keep Lopez!  Sure, I didn't think Olson\nwould recover this quickly.  Maybe I can talk Caminiti into\nrunning into him again?\n\nSchuerholz:  Nope, Lopez has gotta go.  You know that he'll get\n$3 million in arbitration.  May as well put it off that one\nextra year.  Besides, until Olson's shown his stuff a little\nbit, I can't trade him.  Besides, Berryhill's a left-handed\nhitter.  You know how rare that is?\n\nCox:  Don't you mean a left-handed whiffer?  Pretty common,\nif you ask me.  I mean, he made Pat Borders look good in\nthe World Series.  PAT BORDERS!!!\n\nSchuerholz:  Hey, you're the one who wouldn't write Lopez\ninto the lineup.\n\nCox:  Well, you're the one who went out and got me Jeff\nReardon!  Besides, I thought Lopez wouldn't be used\nto our pitching staff's stuff.  He got some time with\nthem this spring...looked pretty good.  Come on, surely\nwe only need to keep one stiff behind the plate?\n\nSchuerholz:  Yeah, but which stiff?  Whichever one we keep\nwill be hurt by May.\n\nCox:  OK, OK, you made your point.  Keep them both.  Surely\none of them will be on the DL by June at the latest.  Then I\ncan call up Lopez, and then we can win 110 games!  The Pennant!\nTHE WORLD SERIES!  I'll be up there with John McGraw!  Casey\nStengel!  Earl Weaver!  Oh, they laughed at me in Toronto,\nbut have you ever had to deal with George Bell?  I'll finally\nget my just reward!  Mwa-ha-ha-ha!\n\nSchuerholz:  Easy, Bobby.  Have you been taking those\n"happy pills" left around by Chuck Tanner?  Why'd you\never hire that guy anyhow?\n\nCox:  Don't ask me; ask Ted.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\nEric Roush		fierkelab@	bchm.biochem.duke.edu\n"I am a Marxist, of the Groucho sort"\nGrafitti, Paris, 1968\n\nTANSTAAFL!

Once again, the Rockies bullpen fell apart.  Andy Ashby pitched six (somewhat\nshaky) innings giving up just one run.  Then game the dreaded relief.  Three\npicthers combined to give up 3 runs (one each I believe) in the 7th inning\nand blew the save opportunity.  (Final was 4-2 vs Expos).\n\nDespite their problems in the pen, I think the Rockies are a team that wont\nbe taken lightly.  Going into today's game, the had the league's leading\nhitter and RBI man (Galarraga), two of the leaders in stolen bases (Young\nand Cole) and increasingly strong starting pitching.\n-- \n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDavid Rex Wood -- davewood@cs.colorado.edu -- University of Colorado at Boulder
Hey Valentine, I don't see Boston with any world series rings on their\nfingers.  Damn, Morris now has three and probably the Hall of Fame in his \nfuture.  Therefore, I would have to say Toronto easily made the best \nsigning.  And don't tell me Boston will win this year.  They won't \neven be in the top 4 in the division, more like 6th.
Whatever you say.  I think it's just 12 games into the season myself, so\nI'm going to wait a bit before calling names.\n\n\nI expect that Dave Otto will be a really bad pitcher, and I have no\nidea why Simmons ever wanted him.  On the other hand, I expect him to\nrelease Otto if he doesn't turn things around pretty fast.  (BTW,\nOtto's game score for that 0 IP stinker was only 22, which points out\na problem with the method since Otto's performance was infinitely bad,\nand excruciatingly prolonged.)\n\n\nI think Merced's rookie year was a bit flukey, but aren't you willing to\ngive him some more at bats (and Tomlin a few more starts) before acting\nso gloomy?\n\n\nNo he didn't.  Walk is a time bomb.  He has no stuff whatsoever, and when\nthe league finally realizes this, it won't be pretty at all.\n\n\nDon't be so fast.  Doughty is the guy who signed Steve Buechele, which\nwas a move that threatened to bury Kevin Young in the minors.\nMeanwhile, I'm not sure whether Doughty or Simmons signed Martin as a\nsix-year free agent before the 1992 season.\n\n\nTwice through the rotation, and you've given up?  Yikes.\n\n\nBut so has his age, at least in baseball terms.  The useful half-life\nof a 34- year-old injury-prone catcher can't be much longer than a year.\n\n\nBut he wanted to be a Dodger, and felt he had something to prove after his\ndisastrous 1992.  I don't think there was any chance for the Bucs to sign\nhim.\n\n\nHe certainly wasn't last year.\n\n\nHey, that's the "Skates Smith" package deal.  Anybody who acquires\nLonnie for his defense or base-running (particularly at this stage) is\na real weirdo.\n\n\nIf that's the goal of the team ownership, than I don't see why Sauer\ngets a zero for making his boss happy.  I don't know what he has or\nhasn't said about revenue sharing, so I can't comment there.\n\n\nIt's annoying, but since Leyland seems to have been pushing for them\nto retain Jeff King, it was probably unavoidable.  Meanwhile, I think\nbigger accomplishments of Simmons' tenure were getting some value for\nJohn Smiley, not trading real prospects for veterans down the stretch\nlast year, drafting well in 1992, letting the rookies show something\nin 1993.  Foley, Smith, and Candelaria were acquired to be replacement\nparts, which means that even if fail it hasn't done serious damage to\nthe Bucs' future.\n\n\nDoes this mean that the Bucs lost the initial arbitration case?  I\nnever heard the outcome of this.  When will the final verdict be in on\nthis?\n\n\nI'm not sure who was the idiot in this case, so I don't know who to\nblame.  It might have been Doug Danforth, after all.  In fact, I\n*seriously* suspect it was Doug Danforth, who has shown his\nwillingness to call the shots at exactly those moments when the gun is\npointed at his feet.\n\n(btw--I've wondered whether my latest posts have been getting\noff-site, so if somebody known to impersonate e.e. cummings can see\nthis, would he drop me a short note?)
Were they palying football or baseball in Detroit on Saturday?  From looking\nat the school, some people may think it was football.  Between two games this\nweek, the Tigers scored 40 runs!!!!  The offense can carry them, I hope the\npitching will hold out.  I was at Camden Yards yesterday, everytime I looked\nup the score was getting higher.  What a great site it was to see the Tigers\nkicking butt while enjoying a game at Camden Yards.  GO TIGERS AND GO TONY\nPHILLIPS!!!!!!!!
Robert C Hite writes\n\nI think the only Phillies in effect here are Philly Blunts.  Of course, if this  \nall becomes true, I'll be the first to smoke one myself.
Not really, though I wouldn't personally say "the most deserving\ncandidate wins".  Rarely does a player win ROY when called up in mid\nseason, and there have been several duds in recent years.  But this is\nmore a factor of mediot biases than anything else.  (I wonder.  If\nAmaral hits like he is capable of, will he receive ROTY votes?  He's\nonly 31, he could have a long career ahead of him!  :-)\n\n\nI think they are a second-division team.  They should finish ahead of\nthe Royals, Mariners, and *possibly* Athletics.  But I don't think\nthey'll be above .500.  (I think the East is stronger this year.)\n\nLast year their pitching was bad and their offense was horrible.  This\nyear their offense is better, but their pitching is still pretty bad.\nEven if Finley returns to form, he won't replace what they lost in\nAbbott.  Sanderson?  Farrell?  I don't believe it.\n\nAnd while their BA may be good, and they have decent speed, their\noffense lacks punch.  They don't have any bona fide power hitters.\n(Salmon, Snow, Davis, and Curtis?  None with more than 20 HR\npotential.)\n\nCheers,\n-Valentine
I am hoping to produce the first update of the BB DDD this week;\nplease send info about the most significant (longest, most critical,\netc.) home run that you have seen yet this season.

Wasn't Hulett injured yesterday after being hit in the face with a ball\nwhile running bases?  I heard something about him recieving stiches and a\npossible broken nose.  Is he at the park?\n\n\nLet's see how they feel when he's 0 and 4 with a 4.9 ERA.  I have my\ndoubts about Fernando.\n\n\nWell, when a fan favorite gets dumped, he's gonna get an outstanding\novation on his first return.  Let's add up the ovations Cal has recieved\nover the years during the game and compare that to Billy.\n\nBTW, Sutcliffe's getting knocked around pretty good.  Rangers up 5 - 1 in\nthe bottom of the fourth.

Why are the Red Sox in first place?  Eight games into the season, they\nalready have two wins each from Clemens and Viola.  Clemens starts\nagain tonight, on three days rest.\n\nWhat's up?  Are the Sox going with a four-man rotation?  Is this why\nHesketh was used in relief last night?\n\nHm.
Well, after suffering from an intense fit of Minnesota-induced cabin fever,\nI've decided to road trip to Milwaukee and take in a couple of games this\nweekend. A couple games at County stadium will be great to relieve tension, \nbut I thought "Why not go to Wrigley for a game too?"  \n\n  I see the Cubs are playing the Phillies on Sat (2:05 start, I believe\nthat's Eastern time listed). I figured it would be fun to bounce down to\nWrigley for the day game and live it up a little. I'm wondering if anyone\n(esp. Cubbie fans) have some advice on: \n\n  1) If I'm taking 41 (Skokie Hwy) south until it runs into 94, what's the \n     best way to get to Wrigley? I'm planning on getting there an hour or  \n     two early and paying through the nose for parking to keep things easy. \n\n  2) Is it probable that I'll be able to walk up and get bleacher seats (2 or\n     3) on game day? I figure since it's early in the year, Ryno's out and \n     the weather isn't great I should be able to get tickets. If not, what's \n     the best way to get advance tickets; can I call the Cubs' ticket office\n     directly and pick up tickets at the will call window?  \n\n  3) Any advice on where to eat before or after the game? \n\n  4) Do they allow inflatable I-luv-ewe dolls (present from Lundy) into the \n     bleachers? :-)
The event that had the most impact on Gaetti's career was his leg injury\nin 1988.  His performance dropped radically from 1988 to 1989.  He was \nstill with the Twins in 1989 and 1990, but if you look at his stats (both\noffensive and defensive), he never has come back to his pre-injury level.
Polish and Jewish are *not* mutually exclusive.
I think you can add former A's first baseman Mike Epstein (no relation) to \nthe list.
I remember one he hit circa 1976 at Wrigley Field that went across\nthe street (in dead center field) and hit a house on the roof.  He\nwhiffed a lot, but when he *did* connect, watch out!\n\n\n\n\n-- \n\n#include <std_disclaimer.h>

Sandberg is not particulary known for his stolen bases.  What competition did \nAlomar have?  Sandberg came in a year after Ripken, and the same year as Boggs,\nGwynn, and the other magicians.  So less attention was given to Sandberg. \nAlomar is the only one in his class to be worth a mediocre.  Besides the \nnumbers don't count.  National league pitchers are much better pitchers. \n\nLarry                          on someone elses account \n--
I believe we are down to two:  the 15-day and the 60-day.  (I don't remember \na 30-day, but rather a 21-day.  Anyways, it's gone now.)  The period length \nis a minimum, not a maximum.  You can keep a guy on the 15-day for as long \nas you want, IF he's still certified as injured.  The player must be \nperiodically re-evaluated to determine if he's still injured (thus you \ncannot park a player on the DL who maybe is out of options and you do not \nwish to expose to waivers).  If you get someone qualified for the 60-day \nthat reduces the frequency of re-evaluations.  There is no longer, I \nbelieve, any limit to the number of players you can place on the DL.  When \nthere was, you often had to choose and juggle your injured players between \nthe lists.\n--King "Sparky" Banaian				|"No taxes:  No new taxes,\nkbanaian@pitzer.claremont.edu			|no old taxes, we are taxed\nDept. of Economics, Pitzer College		|enough." -- Rep.

ATTN: Those who live inthe Philadelphia Metro area...\n\nBack in September I was listening to WIP, and I remember the morning\nguys were talking with Mayor Ed Rendell.  The topic of conversation\nwas a new ball park for the Phillies.  The location for this new park\nwas suggested to be near 30th St Station.  At the time, the mayor was\noptimisitic that in the future this could become a reality.  Has\nthere been any new news on this subject or is it still a pipe dream?\nI know the city of Philadelphia has other projects ahead, such as the\nnew convention center and the upcoming Spectrum II.  But it would be\nnice to see this a reality.  It is planned that the Phillies leave\nthe VET and leave it solely to the Eagles (and if that's the case,\nthe Eagles should make the VET a grass stadium, but that's another\nstory).  I want to see that day!
The Dodgers have been shopping Harris to other teams in their\nquest for more left-handed pitching.  So far, no takers.\nPersonally, I think Harris is a defensive liability, and he\nhas also led the team in past years for hitting into double\nplays, or at least been among the leaders.\n \nSharperson showed last year that if given a chance to play\nevery day, he can get the job done.  If Sharpy played just\none base every day, say third, he'd also improve defensively.\n \nWallach has helped tremendously on defense, as has Reed.\nThe improved defense is quite noticeable and is having an\neffect on the pitching staff.  Both Astacio AND Martinez\nwere bailed out in recent starts by great defensive plays.\nMartinez pitched into the ninth in a game that might\nhave seen him lifted in the third in past years.\n \nAstacio lasted 7 innings the other day under similar circumstances.\nThe Dodgers are turning double plays, and keeping more balls\nin the infield than last year.  And Piazza has also been great\non defense.  He has thrown out 10 of 14 batters trying to\nsteal and has at least one pick off at first.\n \nWallach, clearly, has contributed to the over all improvement on\ndefense.  But his offense is awful and he has cost the Dodgers\nsome runs.  But I don't think he is as bad as his current average.\nI suspect he will come out of this slump much as Davis and Straw\nseem to have come out of theirs.

I am fortunate enough to have tickets for an Orioles-Red Sox game in  \nBaltimore on Saturday, July 31st.  I haven't been to the new park,\nand I was wondering if anyone out there can give me pointers or good tips  \nor anything helpful about the place so that I can enjoy every moment spent\nthere.\nFor instance, what time do the gates open?  Do we see the Orioles take BP?\nWhen will the Red Sox take BP?  Anything you can tell me would be \nappreciated.

Having run completely out of time, I've got to get my prophesies and\npredictions for the A.L. out.  Qualifications -- one of the worse\nfinishes in last year's prediction contest.\n\nAL East -- 1993\n\n1.  Baltimore Orioles\nWhy the Orioles?  Well, I pondered long and hard, and it all came down to\nthis:\n  -- The Blue Jays are going the wrong direction.\n  -- Can't bring myself to pick the Yankees\n  -- Milwaukee was a fluke\n  -- Indians aren't ready to contend\n  -- Red Sox were bad last year, and didn't get any better\n  -- Detroit's pitching will be the new definition of "replacement level"\n"But you don't really think the Orioles will win, do you."  No.  As a matter\nof fact, I can't see any team in the American League winning either division\non paper (with the possible exception of the Yankees, who I hate).  But some-\nbody has to win, so I pick the Orioles.  "You don't really think that Brady\nAnderson is going to repeat, do you?"  No.  I'm basing the Orioles prediction\non the expectation of big years from Cal Ripken and Glenn Davis.  "Glenn\nDavis?  That's insane".  Yes.  So, without further ado:\nSTRONG POINTS:  Hoiles, Ripken some years, Olson, getting rid of Billy Ripken.\nWEAK POINTS:  Segui may start.  Valenzuela (the original 30-something) may be\n  the fifth starter.  Oates puts his best hitters at the bottom of the lineup.\n  (Does anybody else think that might be a calculated maneuver to minimize\n  the effect of a slumping Ripken?  If you can't move Ripken out of the #3\n  spot, why not move the rest of the line up?)\nWOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Glenn Davis wins comeback player of the year.\nWOULD BE A BAD SIGN:  In a tight pennant race, team trades for Pecota.\nObPrediction:  "The Streak" continues.  Harold Reynolds leads the team in\n  caught stealing.\n\n2. New York Yankees.\nSTRONG POINTS:  Abbot, Key, Perez.  Could have best pitching in American\n  League.  Boggs should improve on Hayes.\nWEAK POINTS:  Mattingly still considered best hitter.  The Steinbrenner \n  factor.  (The Yankees lost to the Mets.  Can wholesale changes be far\n  behind?)  Never count on rookie pitchers (i.e. Wickman & Millitello) to\n  win a division.\nWOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Boggs hits over .300\nWOULD BE A BAD SIGN:  Howe gets arrested again.\nObPrediction:  Mattingly won't top a 700 OPS.\n\n3.  Toronto Blue Jays\nSTRONG POINTS:  Management willing to make big deals.  Management has eerie\n  power to convince other teams its prospects are not suspects.  Olerud.\n  Guzman.  Alomar.\nWEAK POINTS:  The Jackson for Bell trade has shaken my faith in Gillick.\n  Losing Stewart may hurt rotation (that's *really* a bad sign).  No one in\n  the outfield can get on base.  Pitching is thin behind Guzman and Ward.\nWOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Jack Morris considered Cy Young contender in August\nWOULD BE A BAD SIGN:  Club makes no major deals in August.\nObPrediction:  Morris will post better ERA and WHIP totals than last year.  And\n  have a losing record.\n\n4.  Milwaukee Brewers\nSTRONG POINTS:  Pitching staff was exceptional -- last year.\nWEAK POINTS:  Molitor gone.  Surhoff at third?  Why?  Eldred can't keep it up.\nWOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Listach and Eldred play like last year.\nWOULD BE BAD SIGN:  Bones plays like last year.\nObPrediction:  Surhoff won't finish the year at third.\n\n5.  Cleveland Indians\nSTRONG POINTS:  Baerga, Belle, Nagy\nWEAK POINTS:  Pitching staff thin -- losing Olin really hurts.  Starts Felix\n  Fermin.\nWOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Bielecki's ERA is consistent with his Atlanta starts.\nWOULD BE A BAD SIGN:  Ted Power -- bullpen ace.\nObPrediction:  Alomar will be back on the DL by the all-star break.\n\n6.  Boston Red Sox\nSTRONG POINTS:  Clemens, Viola, Clemens, Detroit, Clemens\nWEAK POINTS:  Most incompetent GM in baseball.  Key free agent signing -- Andre\n  Dawson.  Burks is gone -- Hatcher in center.\nWOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Rainouts in between Clemens starts.\nWOULD BE A BAD SIGN:  Clemens on the DL\nObPrediction:  Russell will make Sox fans forget Reardon.  Interpret that how\n  you will :->\n\n7.  Detroit Tigers\nSTRONG POINTS:  Tettleton, Phillips, Whitaker\nWEAK POINTS:  If Fielder keeps declining, he'll be a shortstop this year.\n  Worst rotation in baseball entirely replaced -- but not necessarily better.\n  This year could be *very* ugly.\nWOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Cecil Fielder deserving the MVP.\nWOULD BE A BAD SIGN:  Cecil Fielder not whining about deserving an MVP.\nObPrediction:  Cecil *won't* lead the league in RBIs.\n\nOne more division to go....\n-- \nDale J.

Sherri Nichols writes\n\nOr a young Don Bordello...\n\n\nThere's a strong possibility that the Bucs have absolutely no other catching  \nprospects in the minors at this point -- at least nobody ready for any serious  \nAAA/majors duty.  The main reason they might have stayed with Prince could be  \njust age, especially if Spanky was creeping toward his mid-30s or something.\n \nAll things considered, though, I'd be a lot more comfortable with Spanky behind  \nthe plate than Prince.  Isn't there decent backup backstop out there looking  \nfor work?
Are you for real?  How many Gold Gloves does Ozzie Smith have?  If a\nguy hung around and hit 30 homers a year for 15 years, wouldn't he\nbe a given for the Hall?  Is defense not just as important?  And if\nRobin Yount couldn't hit, why would he have stuck around long enough\nto get 3,000 hits?  Are you saying 3,000 hits is a fluke?  3,000\nhits is no big deal?  \n\nI agree, Garvey and Morris don't deserve it. \n\n\nWell, based on your argument, Nolan Ryan doesn't deserve the Hall of\nFame.  He is just a right hander who stuck around for a long time\nand could throw hard.  Very few 20 game winning seasons, lots of\nlosing seasons, lots of walks.  No Cy Young awards.  How does Nolan\nRyan compare to a guy like Steve Carlton who dominated 5 or 6 Major\nLeague seasons, won 7 divisons, 2 World Series, and won half of his\nteams games in 1972?  He doesn't compare.  Not even close.
Why?  Do you expect him to remain the best shortstop in the game until\nhe reaches his seventy-third birthday, or something?  Why is it such a\nstrange concept that a forty-one-year-old Ozzie Smith might be a defensive\nliability in 1996?
Might? You'd have to have no sense of humor at all not to! My favorite\nstuff are the Zero Heros, players who haven't hit homers in a long time, \nthe LGTGAH (who is that named after, I can't remember), and the box score\nline of the week. Incidentally, I just found out that the column has been\nmoved to Sundays. I get my Dad to send it to me up here in Boston every \nweek. Great stuff!
To all those out there wondering about who holds the record for three\nhomer games ina career, the answer is Johnny Mize in his career with the \nCards and the Yanks.  He hit three 6 times.  I am almost sure about this. In\ncase anyone is wondering, the record for two homer games is held by Babe\nRuth and is 72.  Mize's record may not last for much longer because of Juan\nGonzalez.  He has at least three games with three and maybe 4.  I know that \nhe had at least two last year and one as a rookie.  I don't have any record\nbooks at college for me to check on though.  Please let me know, okay, if I \nam wrong.  \n	Onto the Padres.  Is there anyone out there who follows them?- especial-ly those with access to local news?  I don't here anything in Los Angeles and I\ncan't get McPaper consistently around here.  \ncomment:  It looks as though San Diego has gotten the better of the two deals\nthat brought Bell and Plantier to the Padres.  It has also forced the team to use Darrell Shermann.  Of course, Plantier could get injured again or he could \nhit with the power of 91 but with a lower average.  Bell always could finish\nwith .240 and 15-18 hrs-essentially Jerald Clark's numbers.  \nleadoff comment:  Craig Shipley??????  I get on base 29% of the time if I'm \nlucky at leadoff?  Hell, of the usual starters, use Gwynn.  He's got 4 steals\nalready.  Is Shipley starting because of an injury to Stillwell, though?  I\nhaven't seen Stillwell's name in any box scores.  Anyway unless you are going\nto use Shermann at leadoff then use Gwynn.  He at lesat gets on base and this\nyear is stealing bases.\nSheffield comment:  Though the season is early and stats mean nothing.\nWitness Phillips batting .500+ currently.  But does Sheffield have an injury,\nor anythingelse wrong with him.  I just don't hear anything.\nAndy Benes:  Is he pitching like he did in the second half of '91?   or is \nthis a flash of promise that he throws out evrey now and then?   Has anyone \nseen him pitch the two good games?\nscore for today, Sunday april 18:  Padres 10, St Louis 6.  Padres sweep the\nCardinals as Gwynn goes 5 for 5 with a homer.  Sheffield and Tueful also homer\nin a winning cause.  \n				Thanks for listening-reading\n				any comments????
We have no way of knowing because we cannot separate Morris' contribu-\ntion  from the rest of the team's.  There is only one way of determin-\ning "best" in baseball.  And that is by looking at the  scoreboard  at\nthe  end  of  the game.  Each game determines which *team* is the best\nthat day.  At the end of the season, the team that was  the  best  the\nmost  often  is  the best in the division.  The playoffs determine the\nbest of the best.  But the point is that the only decision making pro-\ncess  used to determine the "best" is the score of the game and it re-\nlates to the *teams*.  Not the individual players.  There is no method\ninherent  in  baseball of comparing individual performances.  And that\nis how it should be, because, after all, baseball is a team game.\n\nTo say that one player is better than another is to be able to say ab-\nsolutely  that  player A's team would have played better with player B\nin their lineup.  Sheer speculation.  Impossible to ascertain.\n\nIf you want to select a group of statistics and claim that Clemens has\ndone  better  with those statistics as a criteria, then fine.  But you\nhave  to  be  able  to  prove  that  those  statistics   measure   the\nindividual's  contribution  to  winning  the WS - because  that is the\nonly measure of "best" that has any meaning in the  context  of  base-\nball.   So  until you can prove that Clemens contributes to a WS cham-\npionship more than Morris your evaluation of  Clemens is totally  sub-\njective  and  is  mere opinion.  I have yet to see that any of you can\npredict a WS winner with any greater accuracy than Jeanne Dixon.\n\n\nExactly.  The Jays won with Morris pitching.   And  Boston  wins  with\nClemens pitching.  I am not saying that Morris is better than Clemens.\nI am saying that individual comparisons between  players  are  totally\nmeaningless  and  that anyone claiming that Clemens is better based on\nhis ERA has missed the point of what baseball is all about.\n\n\nYou don't have to be rude.\n\n\nFor you to say that means that you have either missed the entire point\nof  my  argument, or you yourself have committed a fallacy - Ignoratio\nElenchi.  I am not saying that Morris is better than Clemens   because\nhe   has  more   rings   (although  I  have,  tongue in cheek, claimed\nthat in the past).  I am saying that it is impossible to  isolate   an\nindividual's  performance   from that of his team's for the purpose of\ncomparing that individual's performance with another individual's per-\nformance.\n\nThe stats are a nice hobby and  that's  about  it.  There  is  no  new\nknowledge being produced.  So when a poster claims that Morris is better\nthan Clemens because he has more rings, the poster is no more nor less \nincorrect than the rest of you baying hounds.\n\n--
Article from as follows
For your information, Lankford is injured (I think it is his shoulder or rib\ncage), so he could not use him as a pinch hitter.\n \nI do believe that Whiten was a very good aquisition for the Cards.  He does\nnot have too much offensive capabilities, but he is an awesome defensively.\nSince when have the Cardnials actually thought of offense instead of defense?:)\nI forgot who St. Louis gave up for him, but it was not too much.\n \nAs far as Gilkey is concerned, he is a leftfielder and so is Brian Jordan, who\nbeat him out.  I expect to see a Gilkey/Jordan platoon in LF.\n \nI agree with you on this one.  As soon as Larkin threw that ball, I knew that\nLankford was a dead bird.  But how could Dent have known that Larkin would make\na perfect throw?\n \nI strongly believe that Torre is one of the best managers in baseball.  Don't\nforget the overachieving Cards of '91 that won all those close games and went\nfrom last place to second place (although they were oveshadowed by the Braves/\nTwins last to first climb).  He won a division title, and barely lost a pennant\nrace when he was with the Braves (why Atlanta ever even considered firing him I\nwill never understand).  With Torre at the controls, the Cardinals are heading\nin the right direction.\n \nOne more thing, one game does not make a season.  Yes, they lost to the Reds,\nbut with the second best pitching staff in the National League (first in the\nEast), and a pretty good offense, the Redbirds will win a lot more than they\nlose.  Maybe this is the year that they will go all the way.\n \nCharles, a very enthusiastic Cardnials fan\n \n  -----------------------------------------------------------------\n  º Charles Rosen            º      THIRTY-FOUR TO THIRTEEN!!!    º\n  º University of Alabama    º   NATIONAL CHAMPS!!!

Only if you persist in believing that Peter Gammons is more knowledgable about\nbaseball than the average mailbox.  Okay, I'm overstating.  Still, the man \nactually had the gall to say that one out of every six pitchers in the NL this\nyear did not pitch in the majors last year.\n\nHuh?\n\nIMO, this expansion will not see the explosive jump in offense that the \nother expansion drafts had, since the talent was diluted over both leagues.\nIn Gammons' defense, because the talent drain came from the AL as well, some\nincrease will be seen.  He also gets credit for mentioning that the 1969 jump\nin offense was due also to the rules changes after the 1968 season.  He's still\nfull of it...
And then cs1442aq@news.uta.edu (cs1442aq) quoth:\n\nThat's too bad.  I really had hoped Nolan could end his career with a great\nyear.  I suppose there is still hope.
It depends.  If you can get your old veterans cheap, and if they can perform\nat a higher level than your young talent can *now*, why not the talent \ndevelop in the minors while giving the fans some familiar names to cheer.\nIf the veterans are gone in a year or two -- that should be just about right.\n\n\nOpen question -- which was more important to the expansion clubs, the expansion\ndraft or the regular draft.

Usually one or two teams changes their logo or a minor\nuniform change per season, but the past few seasons have been\nincredible.\n	Any thoughts on the new (old) Reds uniforms.  I\nremember seeing a Pete Rose rookie card, and unless I miss my\nguess he was wearing the exact same duds.  \n	The Mets (HOW ABOUT DOC'S PERFORMANCE TODAY?!!!!!) have\nreinserted the Mets patch on the shoulder, and changed the Mets\ninsgnia on the front of the jersey.  To my knowledge it is the\nfirst time that has been changed since 1962, and it reminds me\na little of the Dodger logo.  \n	Many teams have opted for a return to a previous style\nof uniform, or at least uniforms that look more traditional.\n(Phillies, Reds, Expos, White Sox, Padres, etc.) and the once\nbright colors have been altered to gray.  The trend has also\nseen the newer baseball fields resembling the parks of the\nearly years, as opposed to the cookie-cutter saucer stadiums\nconstrucrted throughout the sixties.\n	With salaries now reaching unbelievable highs, no one\nin the comissioner's office, and inter-league play on the\nhorizon, it's nice to see that baseball at least looks like it\nwas meant to be.
Does anybody else think that WS stats should become part of\na player's career stats?   Why not?
Am I the only person who thinks the Reds sleeveless uniforms are\nugly?  Yet another reason why they won't win the NL West! ;)\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\nEric Roush		fierkelab@	bchm.biochem.duke.edu\n"I am a Marxist, of the Groucho sort"\nGrafitti, Paris, 1968\n\nTANSTAAFL!

Philadelphia at Chicago:  Teams tied for 1st after Sunday\n     Dick Redding battled Chet Brewer in the first game of a dramatic four\ngame series.  One Friday, one Saturday, and a good-old Sunday doubleheader.\n"What could be better," declared Ernie Banks.  Perhaps the fact that the Cubs\nare challenging?\n     "It's pitching, it's always been pitching that we've lacked," announced\nRyne Sandberg.  "If we can get by Brewer, then beat Carlton, Alexander, or\nBunning - preferrably 2 of the last three - we'll know we might be able to\nwin.\n     "Lord, I hope we pull it off."\n     The Phils scored once in the top of the first; Richie Ashburn singled, Pete\nRose followed with a hit, sending Ashburn around second.  Kiki Cuyler cut\nthe ball off in left center, and threw a bullet in to Ernie Banks, who threw\nto Ron Santo to get Ashburn at third.  Rose went to second on the play.\n     Christobel Torrienti lifted a long fly to center, moving Pete Rose to\nthird.  Schmidt was walked - the Cubs were absolutely refusing to let him\nbeat them.  Both Torrienti and Schmidt will likely draw 130-150 walks this\nyear.  Chuck Klein is starting to hit very well, and he lashed a double into a\ngap in right-center.  "Cool Papa" Bell's speed allowed him to cut the ball off\nand prevent Schmidt from scoring.  Nellie Fox was walked, and Bob Boone\ngrounded out to second, ending the threat.  \n     "Teams are starting to realize that you don't have to pitch to Schmidt or\nTorrienti, and that is lowering their run total.  It puts a lot of pressure on\nKlein and Dick Allen (who platoons with Chuck Klein and occasionally spells\nRose at first), and it's a credit to the Phillies that they've been able to\nsustain their pace.  The picthers have slumped at times."  So came the\nanalysis from Frank Chance.\n     The Cubs got that run back when Bell bunted for a hit, Thomas' grounder\nmoved him to second, and - after Sandberg made out - Billy Williams singled\nhome a run.  In the sixth, Ron Santo launched a two-run homer to make it\n3-1.  Dick Redding got in trouble in the eighth, as Schmidt singled and Klein\nsingled him to third.  Ed Reulbach entered to face Fox, but Dick Allen popped\nout of the dugout to hit.  Allen doubled to right, but luckily for the Cubs,\nWilliams had moved to left and Andre Dawson had been inserted for defense.\nHe fired a bullet to home plate to keep Klein at third.  Lance Parrish, hitting\nfor Boone, was walked, and Bruce Sutter entered.  Larry Bowa grounded into\na 1-2-3 double play, but Ed Delahanty walked as a pinch-hitter.  Desiring a\nstrikeout, since Ashburn was likely to attempt a bunt hit with the quick\nTrillo pinch-running at third, Chance brought in Lee Smith, who induced a\npop-up to the catcher from the speedy centerfielder, ending the inning.  The\nCubs took the win, 3-2, moving a game behind the Phillies.\n     Steve Carlton was called upon to battle 3-Finger Brown Saturday.  To get\nanother righthander in the lineup, Ron Santo moved to first and Bill Madlock\nplayed third.  Unfortunately, Brown allowed six doubles, and the Cub bullpen\nwas worn down even more, as the Cubs tried to maintain a lead against\nLefty.  Madlock, batting sixth, had knocked two doubles of his own, driving\nhome four runs.  Gabby Hartnett hit two home runs, and Cuyler added\nanother, and the score was 8-6, Cubs after six innings.  The Phillie bullpen\nhad more troubles in the bottom of the eighth, as the Cubs grabbed 3 more\nruns to ice an 11-7 triumph.\n     Sunday's twin bill saw Cool Papa Bell gather seven straight hits at one\npoint, including a rare outside-the-park home run in the second game, off\nRobin Roberts.  Grover Alexander of the Phils took the first contest, 4-2, but\nthe Cubs captured the second one 5-4, with Waddell gaining the win.  Bruce\nSutter tossed two innings for the save, though he allowed one run in the\neighth.  The Cardinals stood half a game behind these co-leaders, and would\nconclude their series with the Expos on Monday.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n     Montreal at St. Louis(August 3-6): 3-way tie for 1st\n     Dennis Martinez is on a roll, and he continued it versus John Tudor Friday.\nThe Expos have a wide variety of hitters, and - while they aren't among the\nall-time greats, they are getting the job done.  After winning their first\nfirst two games, they suddenly found themselves only 2 1/2 games out of\nfirst in this wacky season.\n     Martinez triumphed 5-3 on Friday, and WIlliams outdueled Dizzy Dean 3-2\nSaturday.  However, the Cardinals refused to give up, winning 6-2 on Sunday.\nThe Cards captured Monday's game, too, as Steve Carlton outdueled Steve\nRogers 3-2.  "We're really good against ground ball pitchers because of our\nteam speed," remarked Lou Brock.  "I don't see why we can't win this\ndivision."\n     The Phillies and Cubs may have some reasons for them.  Two-thirds of\nthe way through the season, there is a 3-way tie for first.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n     New York at Pittsburgh(August 3-6): 3 straight 3-2 wins for Bucs,\nnow 2 back - but in 4th!\n    "When your team is in a slump like we are, the worst thing is to play in a\npitcher's park like this," spoke Gil Hodges before the series.  Keith\nHernandez added that "their defense takes away quite a few runs per year,\nand it must be giving them an extra 6-7 wins."  The Pirates have made only\n26 errors all season, 6 ahead of the second place Dodgers.  Error totals tend\nto be around 50 for the best defensive All-Time teams.\n     Rube Foster defeated Sid Fernandez 5-2 Friday, and Candelaria outshone\nSeaver 3-2 Saturday, in a game featuring some outstanding defense.  When\nNolan Ryan and two relivers 6-hit the Mets in another 3-2 win Sunday, the\nPirates could once again look forward to a victory getting them back to the\n.500 mark.  They had been unable to several times in the past month.  Bert\nBlyleven met Dwight Gooden in the afternoon game.  Both pitchers possessed\nfantastic stuff, and the only runs scored through eight innings were on home\nruns - a solo shot by Rusty Staub of the Mets and a two-run blast by Ralph\nKiner for the Pirates.  The Mets' Darryl Strawberry singled home a run in the\ntop of the ninth off Jesse Orosco, working his second inning, after Mookie\nWilson pinch-ran for Gary Carter at second.  With one out and a runner on\nfirst, Lee Mazilli was sent in to pinch-hit.  The Pirates countered with Kent\nTekulve, placing him in the fifth spot in the order and putting Barry Bonds in\nleft field as the ninth place hitter.  Tekulve induced a groundout forcing\nStrawberry at second.  He slid hard into Honus Wagner, preventing the\nPirates from turning their fifth double play of the afternoon.  Tekulve\nallowed a hit, but Clemente threw Mazilli out at third from near the right\nfield line, ending the inning.  Tug McGraw relieved Randy Myers, who entered\nto pitch the eighth, and got one out before Bonds launched a rocket to deep\ncenter, running through the stop sign at third to score an inside-the-park\nhomer to win.  The Pirates had scored an improbable 3 straight 3-2 wins,\nand had moved to within 2 games of first place, with seven weeks to go.\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n     San Francisco at Boswaukta(August 3-5): \n    Another Sunday doubleheader appeared on the schedule, as the Giants\nmanaged to close the gap on the other teams thanks to some starting\npitching that just wouldn't tire.  In fact, reported manager John McGraw,\n"once this rough part of the schedule is over, maybe as early as this coming\nweek, we may shift to a 4-man rotation again for a little while."\n     Juan Marichal continued his hot pitching Friday, beating Lew Burdette and\nthe Braves 4-1.  Willie Mays had all four r.b.i.s on 3 hits.  Rick Reuschel\nfaced Joe Niekro Saturday in a slugfest.  The Braves' park had been a homer\nhaven, but this took the cake, as the Giants won a seesaw affair 16-13.\nWillie Mays had three homers, Willie McCovey, Eddie Matthews, and Don\nBaylor had two, and Hank Aaron, Ernie Lombardi, Biz Mackey, and Mel Ott had\none each.  The Braves had collected 149 home runs going into Sunday's\ndoubleheader, putting them on a pace for 223, which would be 4 short of the\nNational League record.  They were still a tad behind the '61 Yankees' pace.\nThey had allowed over 120, though.  Vida Blue actually got the win after\nretiring 2 batters in the fifth.  He allowed only a run in the sixth, but\nfaltered in the seventh.  Joe McGinnity earned the save.\n     In the doubleheader, the Braves' Hoyt Wilhelm failed to hold a lead in the\nfirst game, but Hank Aaron homered off Bill Foster in the eighth as the\nBraves won, 4-3.  The Giants took the second game, however, by a 6-2 score.\nThe homer by Aaron was a magical #150 by the Braves; however, they fell to\nthree game below .500, making a comeback extremely unlikely.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n     San Diego at Cincinnati(Aug. 3-5):  Randy Jones faced Ewell\nBlackwell in the first of this 3-game series, and the Padres felt rather\ngood.  With Don Mattingly straining his back in the last Cleveland game, the\ntrade looked even better.  McGriff's batting average was even rising.  Of\ncourse, the bench was very poor, and Joe Gordon was only adequate in the\noutfield, but these were minor problems, since the pitching was holding up.\n     Jones pitched a good game Friday, and won 6-3.  McGriff launched two\nhome runs.  Mel Harder earned a win with the help of Mark Davis and Ray\nNarleski Saturday; 5-4 was the final score.  Tom Candiotti battled Satchel\nPaige to a 3-3 tie through eight innings before departing.  The game was\nscoreless for 4 more innings until the thirteenth.  Paige had departed after\n10, and John Franco hurled a scoreless inning.  Tom Browning was working\nhis second scoreless inning, when Dave Winfield doubled with one out and\nJoe Gordon was pitched around.  Thurm Munson doubled both runners home,\nand the Padres gamed a 5-3 win.  The three-game sweep had pulled the\nGiants into a tie with the Reds.  Though the Reds denied it, the highly\nemotional series with the Dodgers may have taken too much out of them.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n     Brookangeles at Houston(August 3-5):\n     Another series capped off by a weekend doubleheader took place in the\nwide open plains of the Astrodome.  The Astros sent Joe Niekro to the hill in\nthe first game, opposite Don Drysdale.  "Normally," Drysdale remarked, "I\nwould be challenging hitter by being ready to throw at them.  I can't afford\nto with this team, though; we have to get our own runners going; we can't\nDavis will get decked once."\n     The fact that Glenn Davis leads the team in homers with six (!) is\nprimarily why he would be decked, but it should be understood that his\ncurrent pace would give him nine for the season.  The hitting on this team is\na little better, but the power is all doubles and triples.  Still, Carl Furillo is\nthe main reason no Astro home runs were hit over the weekend, as he threw\ntwo runners out trying for inside-the-park homers.  For those unaware of\nthe nastness of the Astros' park, they have a 23-foot high gray wall all\naround the outfield; balls must be hit into the seats to be home runs.  The\nfoul poles are 355 feet from home plate, but the alleys are 400 feet away,\nwith center field at 420 feet.  "It's as if some three-year-old threw a\ntantrum and told his playmates: 'If I can't hit home runs, nobody will hit\nhome runs'," remarked Roy Campanella.\n     The Dodgers stole five bases Friday, but the Astros decided to revitalize\nthe Baltimore chopping that had failed 6 weeks before; for tonight, anyway,\nDavis, Jim Wynn, and Jose Cruz did not have to mess with their swings,\naccording to the manager.  After Poles and Willie Wells reached base via the\nBaltimore chop, Drysdale decked Jose Cruz with a pitch.  He responded with\na two-run double, but Wynn - playing first for Davis - popped up, and the\nAstros didn't score any more in that inning.  They did score 3 in the fourth to\nerase a 3-2 deficit, and the Astros wound up winning 6-4.  They threatened\nto do even better the next game, as Tommy John would be their opponent.\nWalt Alston met privately with the starters at 6 A.M. before the game.\n     "I think I know how we can beat the Baltimore Chop," he explained.\n     "How can we do that," Pee Wee Reese wondered.\n     "They're going to be beating the ball down, so we've got to be ready to\nthrow on the run.  Steve will start at first to dig balls out of the dirt, but I\nwant all of you to practice your barehanded picks and throws.  We'll go with\na shallow infield almost the whole time."\n     The plan almost worked.  Mike Scott allowed only two runs through eight\ninnings, but the Astros got three; two of them scored when Bill Doran\npushed a bunt into the outfield in the fourth with runners on second and\nthird.  3-2 Astros was the final, with Dave Smith earning another save.  The\nDodgers scored a victory in the first game of the twin bill Sunday, as Nolan\nRyan walked five, three of whom scored in a 4-1 Dodger win.  Fernando\nValenzuela lost the second game 4-2 to Don Sutton, however, as the Dodgers'\nthirteen stolen bases in the series proved to not be enough.\n     "We're mostly a power team," remarked Ron Cey.  "Jackie and, when he\nplays, Maury Wills are our only real speed demons, though a couple other\nplays can do it now and then.  We're sunk in a place like the Astrodome.  I\nguess that's why they're so successful there."  Indeed, it seems that\nbasestealing teams give them the most trouble in the dome.  The 'Stros\nswiped 12 bases in 16 attempts, giving them 230 on the season.\n     Standings after these weekend series:\nA.L.East\nTeam                     W           L           GB\nNew York                68        42          --\nCleveland               65        46          3.5\nDetroit                 64        46           4\nBoston                  64        47          4.5\nBaltimore               59        52         9.5\nToronto                 43         69        25.5\nWashington              39         73          28\n\nA.L.West\nOaksaselphia            63         48          --\nMinnesota               61         48            1\nChicago                 59         53          4.5\nKansas City             57         54          6.5\nCalifornia              57         56            8\nMilwaukee               45         66           17\nSeattle                 32         78         31.5\n\nN.L.East\nChicago          57         53                --\nPhiladelphia     58         54                --\nSt. Louis        58         54                --\nPittsburgh       56         56                2\nMontreal         53         56               3.5\nNew York         48         64               10\n\nN.L.West\nBrookangeles     66          46               --\nCincinnati       66           47              0.5\nSan Francisco    65          46               0.5\nBoswaukta        54           56               11\nHouston          50          61               17.5\nSan Diego        36          75                29.5
From another not-so-distressed-but-still-wondering-about-a-few-things\nCardinal fan:\n\n	He's not the greatest - this is true.\n	I saw it.\n	Lankford was hurt, although the announcer said he told Torre he\n	could pinch hit if they needed him to.\n	I wondered the same thing.  But giving Joe the benefit of the \n	doubt, I'd say he was thinking that Lankford is hurt enough that\n	he didn't trust his ability to bat effectively but he wants his\n	speed on the bases so pinch run him.  Alicea I was completely\n	confused about.  Maybe he had a good record hitting against that\n	particular pitcher?  I don't know.  Anybody got an idea?\n	Well, so far I haven't seen much to say Whiten shouldn't be playing\n	but it is too bad that Gilkey is the odd man out when they play \n	Jordan ahead of him.  That I don't quite understand.\n	Yup, I looked for this on the replay too.  If I'm Joe Torre, I'm\n	going to have a talk with Bucky after the game on that one.  He's\n	got Lankford at third with Todd Zeile I believe - a hot hitter - \n	coming up - there's no reason to risk giving Lankford the go sign \n	in that situation unless he was sure the ball is going to the stands.  \n	It's his job to watch the play develop - he should have known Larkin \n	was there to back up a bad throw.  That seemed inexcusable in my book.  \n	BTW, I saw Dent do the same thing last year with Zeile rounding third \n	and going into a sure out at home in a critical situation.  On the \n	replay, there's Dent waving him around.  It looks like this might be a \n	serious problem.  The Card's weren't good base runners at all last year \n	and I wonder how much of the fault lies in the base coaching.\n\n	Well, I'm still hanging in there.\n\n	GO REDBIRDS!!  WOOF, WOOF!!!\n\n\nDick Detweiler

Let's look at the effects of inflation on 1930's superstars' salaries.\n\nI read once that the Babe made $80,000 one year and that was about as good \nas it got for him.\n\nLet's assume he made that in 1928 (I'm not sure of the figures, but I know\nI'm in the ballpark--pun intended). :-)\n\nToday, assuming a 4% yearly inflation rate, which is an understatement if\nnot accurate, his measly $80,000 salary would be worth.\n\nFV = $80,000 x (1+4%)^(1993-1928)\n   = $80,000 x (1.04)^65\n   = just over $1,000,000.\n\nAssuming inflation is average of around 5%.\n\nFV = $80,000 x (1+5%)^65\n   = almost 2,000,000.\n\n(I didn't crunch these numbers beforehand).\n\nThese numbers might lead one to believe that today's players are slightly \noverpaid.  The Babe appears to have made then what today's average to above\naverage players make now.  Perfectly accurate salary, year of salary, and \naverage inflation rate would make this analysis more accurate, but I don`t \nthink I'm off by much.\n\nChop Chop\n\nMichael Mule'

Bonds above Mays?\nCheck the numbers of each player in comparison to the numbers of the rest\nof the players that year(s), and you'll see that I'm fairly close with\nthis ranking system (which is primarily based on Total Player Rating) for\nfour consecutive years.
Is there any doubt that this is true?  After a few down years, the A.L. East\nis back to where it was in the early eighties.  With the emergence of the O's\nand the Yanks, it is far and away the best.  While the N.L. West has the best\nteam in baseball, and the Reds aren't bad either, they have nothing else.  The\nGiants, Astros, and Padres all have talent, they do not have the all arounf\nteams that are found in the A.L. East.  And the Dodgers just plain suck.  As\nfor the Rockies, who knows?\n   The A.L. East has the defending champs, and although they lost a lot to\nfree agency, Toronto is still one of the best in baseball.  The Orioles have\nthe preseason favorite to win the Cy Young in Mike Mussina, and you can never\nforget about Ripken.  The signings of Harold Baines and Harold Reynolds don't\nhurt to much either, although I always liked Bill Ripken.  While they let a\nlot go this summer (Randy Milligan, Joe Orsulak, Bill Ripken, Bob Milacki, Sam\nHorn, Storm Davis, and Craig Lefferts), they kept the heart of their team\nintact.\n\nMy predicted finish:\n1. Baltimore (Could be a biased opinion)\n2. NY Yankees\n3. Toronto\n4. Milwaukee\n5. Detroit\n6. Boston\n7. Cleveland (Would have been higher if not for the accident)\n\nGo O's!!!!!!!!
> I wonder if Ojeda will sue anyone - because his career may be over.\n\nNot due to the accident -- he just got a (really) bad haircut.  Now, if you\nmeant due to his floating fastball, well...
Why?  Do you suppose he's immune to the ravages of time?  He's 37.  \nIn a few years he'll be 40.  He doesn't get to as many grounders as\nhe used to, and will get to fewer still as his legs go, as they do\non every human so far.\n\nRemember: Willie Mays was a defensive liability at he end of his\ncareer too.  Ditto Mickey Mantle.  Ditto just about everyone else who \nplayed into their late 30's.
Not necessarily.  It could mean that, or it could mean that he just hit\na lot better at home than he did on the road (see Frank Thomas' home/road\nsplits in '91 for an example).  I would guess that some of Alomar's split\nis due to the Skydome, but most of it is probably due just to coincidence.\nThere's no way to be sure, of course, but the only hitters the Skydome\nseems to regularly help a lot are right handed home run hitters, and\nAlomar is not a home run hitter.\n\n\nOnly because of t&P's bogus fielding stats, which rate Alomar as the worst\ndefensive second baseman in the league.  On a career basis, I think T&P's\nfielding stats may mean something, but on a seasonal basis it comes up\nwith ridiculous results like this.  Alomar may not be the god of fielding\nthe media says he is, but he sure isn't the worst in baseball.\n\nOffensively, T&P rate Alomar much higher last year.\n\nRegarding the A vs. B argument, I'll just say they're both very good players\nwith different strengths and a bright future.
No one says you have to read any of it Ralph.. Go play in traffic.., or take \na nap... They work for me..
I like the Mariners a lot, but my heart belongs to the Cubs...You can imagine\nmy frustration when I saw the Cubs nabbing LeFebvre...ARHGGHRGHH!\n\n-John Neuharth
Indeed, if the color teal on a team's uniforms is any indication of the\nfuture, the Marlins are in dire trouble! Refer to the San Jose Sharks for\nproof... But I have hope for the Marlins. I was a sometime member of the\nRene Lachemann fan club at the Oakland Coliseum, and have a deep respect\nfor the guy. He's a gem. And, of course, Walt Weiss gives that franchise\nclass. But yeah... whoever designed those uniforms was guilty of a paucity\nof style and imagination. Ugghhh!
He's a shortstop by training, but he's been at second (mostly) and third\nthis year for the Expos.
ok - sorry about that...i didn't realise he was being sarcastic about\n those sort of things.\n\nbut i'll tell you, mike lupica (daily news) usually says some pretty\n funny things in his "shooting from the lip" columns...
