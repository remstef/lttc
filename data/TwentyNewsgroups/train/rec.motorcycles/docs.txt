Greetings:\n\nCan someone steer me towards sources of information on vehicle data\nlogging systems?  In  particular, I would like to build/buy (or a little\nof both) a system that is small enough to fit on a motorcycle and will\ntake input from various sensors (pressure, LVDT's, acceleration, RPM,\nO2 sensor...), digitize and record it for later analysis.  \n\nPlease email me any info.  If I get anything interesting, I'll compile\nit and get it on the net.  Thanks.
It can be done, contact Chaparell cycle supply, they ought to have\nthe sprocket you need/want for cheap, well much cheaper than your average\ndealership.

Agreed, but, yes, chapstick fits under the "waxy shit" category,\nalthough I've noticed that stealing Annette's chapstick (after she's\napplied it :-) kept my lips from cracking this past winter like they have\nin all previous winters.

Greg,\n\nI'm very new to motorcycles. Haven't even bought one yet. I was in the same\nposition about you. How do you learn if you've never ridden.\n\nI took a class put on by a group called the Motorcycle Safety Foundation\nin California. They might have something similar in Washington.
I'd bet the price of the helmet that it's okay...From 6 feet\nor higher, maybe not.\n\n\nI'd wear the full facer, but then, I'd be *way* more worried\nabout wind blast in the face, and inability to hear police\nsirens, than the helmet being a little damaged.\n\n\n\nWell, my next helmet will be, subject to it fitting well, an AGV\nsukhoi. That's just because I like the looks. My current one is\na Shoei task5, and it's getting a little old, and I crashed in\nit once a couple of years ago (no hard impact to head...My hip\ntook care of that.). If price was a consideration I'd get\na Kiwi k21, I hear they are both good and cheap.\n\n\nBe *mildly* mildly paranoid about the helmet, but don't get\ncarried away. There are people on the net (like those 2% you\nmentioned) that do not consistently live on our planet...\n\nRegards, Charles\nDoD0.001\nRZ350

Greetings fellow motorcycle roadracing enthusiasts!\n\n BACKGROUND\n ----------\n\n The racing listserver (boogie.EBay.sun.com) contains discussions \n devoted to racing and racing-related topics. This is a pretty broad \n interest group. Individuals have a variety of backgrounds: motojournalism, \n roadracing from the perspective of pit crew and racers, engineering,\n motosports enthusiasts.\n\n The size of the list grows weekly. We are currently at a little\n over one hundred and eighty-five members, with contributors from\n New Zealand, Australia, Germany, France, England, Canada\n Finland, Switzerland, and the United States.\n\n The list was formed (October 1991) in response to a perceived need \n to both provide technical discussion of riding at the edge of \n performance (roadracing) and to improve on the very low signal-to-noise \n ratio found in rec.motorcycles. Anyone is free to join.\n\n Discussion is necessarily limited by the rules of the list to \n issues related to racing motorcycles and is to be "flame-free".  \n\n HOW TO GET THE DAILY DISTRIBUTION\n ---------------------------------\n\n You are welcome to subscribe. To subscribe send your request to:\n\n\n        race-request@boogie.EBay.Sun.COM\n\n\n Traffic currently runs between five and twenty-five messages per day\n (depending on the topic). \n\n   NB: Please do _not_ send your subscription request to the\n       list directly.\n \n After you have contacted the list administrator, you will receive\n an RSVP request.

It seems that many of\nthose 30AH batteries were DOA, near-DOA, and always unlikely to be going\nstrong by the end of the warantee period on them.  THere was a big batch of\nbad ones, and they replaced them with -you guessed it - more bad ones.  BMW\nswitched to a 25AH battery that has more cold cranking amps, even if it has\nless total juice.  \n\nI switched to a YUASA that has even more cold cranking amps and cost one\nthird fewer dollars.

I'm looking for a 1990-91 Kawasaki ZX-6 engine.

OK, as one last attempt, I'll take a different tack.\n\nWe all seem to be in agreement that there are two explanations for why\none can use the handlebars to lean a moving motorcycle. The question is,\nis one of the effect dominant, and which one is it? The idea would be to\ndesign an experiment which would seaprate the two characteristics, and\nsee which effect produces a similar result to the one with which those of\nus who have bikes are familiar.\n\nLet's look at the one that, so far, has sparked no controversy on its\nown, gyroscopic precession. To examine this alone, we would have to\nget rid of the contact patch effect, by not allowing the contact patches\nto transmit any force. The wheels and steering mechanism would have to\nremain, and be attached to a vehicle with about the same weight as a bike,\nthrough suspension (so that the wheels transmit forces to the bike the\nsame way) similar to a bikes. An experiment would be to ride a bike along \na dry road to get moving and to get the wheels spinning, then change \nsurfaces to something that won't transmit forces through the contact \npatches, and try a steering manoeuvre to see if the bike leans. It \nprobably would, since some of us know how easy it is to fall down on ice, \nbut we wouldn't get a good idea of how well or what it feels like \nbecause, without the contact patches, we can't turn.  Maybe there's a \nbetter way. Besides, even ice doesn't get rid of the contact patch\nforces altogether, so we'd have to find a really frictionless surface.\nYou'd have to try it again with the wheels locked to really know if it\nwas the rotation that did it.\n\nLooking at the contact-patch effect only, however, is fairly simple.\nNow we have to find a vehicle that gets the about the same magnitude and\ndirection of cantact patch forces as a motorcycle, and transmits them\nabout the same way to the vehicle, but without rotating wheels.\nHow it gets the contact patch forces is irrelevant, we're just looking\nfor something that has contact patches that can go straight and not\nsideways, and skis or skates would do fine. I don't know of any snow-ski\nor skate bikes, but up here we have the Suzuki Wetbike that is arranged\nlike a motorcycle but has fat water skis where there should be wheels.\nI think the propellor is in front of the rear ski, or something like\nthat, but we could try it at a coast to get rid of most of its effect.\nNow I admit that this is second hand info (although I'd love to try\none of these), but the review in the local cycle rag and a guy in\na bike shop that sells them both say that this machine handles very\nmuch like a motorcycle, in that you countersteer it to turn.\nSo we have contact patches that transmit similar forces to a bike's,\na similar suspension arrangement, and no gyroscopes, but we do have\ncountersteering.\n\nConclusion: you don't need gyroscopes to countersteer vehicles that have\nmotorcycle-like contact patch arrangements. We still don't know what\nreal effect the gyroscopes have when they're there, but from my observations\nof how handlebar angle, force, etc. relate to steering in general, I'm \nwilling to bet that they're not the dominant factor in countersteering. \n\nIf you don't like this conclusion, then don't accept it, but my motorcycle's\nbehaviour is consistent with it. If someone can prove otherwise, go ahead.
}Sheesh, even a trained attack dog is no match for a human,\n}we have *all* the advantages.\n\nI agree with this 100%. After all, when you grab under his chin and\nare careful to keep your hands away from his twisting head, what is\nhe going to do -- tailwag you to death? I even had one occasion where\nI was unexpectedly jumped by a 130 lb. German Shepherd and grabbed\nhis upper jaw in one hand and his lower jaw in the other. Now I'm\nholding his mouth open (no way is he strong enough to clamp down)\nand he can do nothing.\n\nHOWEVER, all this macho shit aside, the fact is that when you are\nriding a bike and a dog is arrowing to intercept, it may be unwise\nfor you to stop and try to deal with the dog, for the simple fact\nthat it might be through your leathers and working on your jeans\nbefore you can dismount and deal with it properly.\n\nBy all means, if you do kick the dog or otherwise get its attention,\nSTOP and STAY there. If you kick the dog and ride away, that is a\nvictory for the dog -- it drove you out of its territory. It is not\neven a qualified victory, it is a victory. If you kick it and STOP,\nand sit there, 99% of dogs will say, "Oh, shit! This guy's serious!"\nand back off. Now you have established your dominance over the dog,\nand it probably will not bother you again.\n\nLlamas, however, are a different story. If you stop near a llama,\nit will just hop on and insist on a ride. And that's if you're\nlucky; if it doesn't like you it'll barf you off the bike and\nsteal it!

A couple of other tips.\n\n1) Make a habit of parking the bike so that instruments are facing away\n   from the sun.\n\n2) Meguiar's Mirror Glaze Plastic Polish & Plastic Cleaner. (Cue canned\n   product plug #2543):\n\n\nWhat you want are Meguiar's Mirror Glaze Plastic Polish and Plastic\nCleaner. They are very mild abrasives meant to remove scratches from\nplastic. For fine scratches just use the Polish, for bigger ones start\nwith the Cleaner and finish with the Polish. The stuff is $5-8 bucks per\nbottle at most auto or motorcycle parts stores. Don't choke over the\nprice too much, since both bottles will probably last you 10 years. The\nstuff works great on plastic watch "crystals" and compact discs too.
Professionals who train guard dogs, when polled, gave themselves a\n1 in 4 chance of survival tackling a trained dog unarmed.  A trained guard\ndog is not to be trifled with.  An untrained mutt may be another story.\n\nObMoto:  A local dog used to chase me all the time.  Really annoying.  I \nfinally started stopping every time he'd chase me.  He didn't know what to do\nthen and would usually just slink off the road.  After a couple weeks of this\nhe stopped chasing me altogether.  He would still chase cars or other bikes,\nthough.

I need some advice on having someone ride pillion with me on my 750 Ninja.\n   This will be the the first time I've taken anyone for an extended ride\n   (read: farther than around the block  :-).  We'll be riding some twisty, \n   fairly bumpy roads (the Mines Road-Mt.Hamilton Loop for you SF Bay Areans).\n\nCommunication:  work out your own system.  Or just slow down and holler\nback every once in a while.  At reasonable speeds, even on my under-muffled\nMagna, we can hear each other.  It's only above, say, 45 MPH that you \ncan't really communicate.\n\nBalance: New passengers are a real pain, because you never know how\nthey're going to react to steering.  Some people catch on immediately\nand lean with me.  Others are completely skittish about the leaning\nthing, and keep their bodies perpendicular to the horizon.  This is a\npain while turning, but manageable.  The WORST are the passengers who stay\nperpendicular to the horizon, then REMEMBER in the middle of a turn\nand WHIP AROUND until they're in the `correct' position.  This always\nscrews up the line I've picked out.\n\nHere's my personal checklist of things to tell passengers:\n	- attire: helmet, long pants, boots/heavy shoes, jacket.\n	- Keep feet on pegs at all times, unless I say otherwise.  Do not\n	  get on/off unless I say you can.  (I've had people try to dismount\n	  in traffic, just as I'm pulling in to a parking space!)\n	- Muffler gets HOT! ('Nuff said)\n	- We get *GOOD* traction.  We're not going to fall over.  (Many\n	  first-time riders are surprised by how tightly you can turn!)\n	- Turn dynamics:  sit so that you feel like you're sitting upright and\n	  we're going straight.  Trust your butt, not your eyes -- if you're\n	  confused, close your eyes for a couple of turns to get the feel\n	  of it.  Or just hug me tight.  \n	- Please, no sudden moves -- shift your weight as desired, but be \n	  gradual, so I can compensate.\n	- Your faceplate is yours to open/close as desired.\n	- Trust is essential.  Trust the driver (me) to do the right \n	  thing -- I've driven many miles on this thing, and know how\n	  to operate it.  Enjoy the ride.  (This is important to\n	  stress.  For example, one of my first-time passwngers seemed to \n	  watch the speedo like a hawk:  I drove her to the beach down 84, \n	  and whever we topped 35 mph, she'd holler, "SLOW DOWN! I'M SCARED" \n	  I humored her for a while, then simply covered the speedometer with \n	  the spare piece of duct tape I keep stuck to the top of the cluster.\n	  Problem solved:  she watched the scenery instead of the\n	  instruments, and had a much better time.  Based on her\n	  experience driving a Lincoln Continental, she was unwilling to \n	  trust my ability to choose a safe speed for the bike.)\n\nUsually I'll point out the controls, engine, transmission, brakes, \ntires, etc. and discuss motorcycle physics a bit too for first-timers.\nHelps calm their nerves, and gives the bike a chance to warm up.\n\nWatch out for gravel on the Mt. Hamilton road:  there were lots of little\nmudslides after the last big rain; by now, many of the blind corners will\nbe nicely covered with a carpet of little, round, nearly invisible stones.\nIt doesn't help build trust when you slide out on a blind corner, on the \nfirst trip!\n\nGood luck -- have fun!
--\n\nThanks to all of you who gave advice on the CB900 Custom. \n\nAs recommended, I had the bike compression tested.  Compression was\na little low, but very even across the four cylinders (+/- 5 psi).  They\nsaid that it was tested a little cold, so that would explain the low \nnumbers (around 90).  Does this sound right?  Otherwise, the bike looked\ngreat.  No signs of road rash, and no rust.  This bike looks great! \nIt is now in the shop getting tuned and new tires.  \nI am opting for the Metzler ME55 and ME33 tires (thanks to those \nwho posted this other thread).  This bike is _BIG_ compared to my other bikes.  \n( Sure is alot harder to load on a trailer than the KDX200 was. )  I should\nbe road legal tomorrow.  I am ignoring the afforementioned concerns about \nthe transmission and taking my chances.\n\nBeing a reletively new reader, I am quite impressed with all the usefull\ninfo available on this newsgroup.  I would ask how to get my own DoD number,\nbut I'll probably be too busy riding ;-).\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------
Splitfires work mainly by providing a more-or-less unshrouded spark to the\ncombustion chamber. If an engine's cylinder head design can benefit from this,\nthen the splitfires will yield a slight performance increase, most noticeably\nin lower rpm range torque. Splitfires didn't do diddly-squat for my 1992 GMC\npickup (4.3l V6) but do give a noticeable performance boost in my 1991 Harley\nSportster 1200 and my best friend's 1986 Sportster 883. Folks I know who've\ntried them in 1340 Evo motors can't tell any performance boost over plain\nplugs (which is interesting since the XLH and big twin EVO combustion chambers\nare pretty much the same shape, just different sizes). Two of my friends who\nhave shovelhead Harleys swear by the splitfires but if I had a shovelhead,\nI'd dual-plug it instead since they respond well enough to dual plugs to make\nthe machine work and extra ignition system worth the expense (plus they look\nreally cool with a spark plug on each side of each head)
Tough question -- more dangerous than driving a car, and far more\ndangerous if you don't apply a modicum of intelligence to the \nactivity.  Basically, stupidity will get you hurt/killed a lot\nfaster on a motorcycle than in a car.  But with care, it is\nnot unreasonably dangerous.  Also, buying good protective\nclothing is helpful, that way if something does go wrong,\nyou are likely to be less severely injured.\n\nFirst thing, if possible take a (MSF) driver training course,\nthis will get you started on the right foot -- they teach\ncontrol of the vehicle and safe riding practices.\n\nSecond, buy protective gear.  At minimum a good helmet\nand a pair of leather gloves are a must.  A good sturdy \npiece of footgear is also very helpful, though leather hiking\nboots, a pair of old army boots, or something similar works fine\nfor this purpose as long as you make sure the laces stay \ntied.  After those, a leather jacket and leather pants or chaps\nare nice as well; but these are also expensive items.  For the\npants, many people consider a good pair of jeans to be reasonable,\npreferably recent and of a fairly heavy weight.  Similarly for\na jacket, a good jean jacket is a reasonable compromise, though\nmore people tend to have leather jackets around than pants.  Another\nthing to do is drop in on garage sales looking for a second-hand\nleather jacket.  Look for a fairly thick leather in these items.\n\nThird don't do anything stupid -- don't ride after \ndrinking, even one drink can noticeably affect you judgement\nand balance; don't ride in the snow, or when conditions\nare such that black ice is likely; be very careful riding\nin the rain -- slow way down, take corners gingerly, \nbrake early and gently;  try not to ride if you are sick,\ntired, taking any medication with drowsiness warnings, or\notherwise not in average shape.\n\nWith care, you should be ok.\n\n\nI would suggest mid to late 80's japanese mid-sized standard.\nSomething in 400-650 cc range would probably be reasonable.  If\nyou are shorter/lighter than average, you might want to go as\nlow as a 300-400 cc bike.\n\nPossible models: \nThe Suzuki GS### series (eg. GS500, GS650, etc.).  These are generally\ninline 4 bikes, generally dependable except for a tendency to \nweakness in the charging system.  (Stator and/or Regulator/Rectifier \nproblems.)  My first bike was a (about '82) GS650, it server me well.\n\nThe Honda Nighthawk series (this may also be known as the CB### series\nI think).  eg. Honda CB450, CB650, etc.  This is another series of\nstandard motorcycles.  Also fairly dependable.\n\nKawasaki and Yamaha probably have similar bikes, but I don't know\nthem as well.\n\nFor mid to late '80s models of the above, you should be able to\nbuy the bike for under $2000, leaving you money for protective \nclothing and insurance and licensing costs.
I too, usually wear sunglasses inside my full face helmet to keep dirt & wind\nout of my contacts.  Mumble, mumble, mumble ...
Damn right. I was late for a climbing meet one morning, so I got\nout of bed without bothering that my right foot was still asleep.\nIt reminded me by folding underneath with a crunching of Metatarsals.\nLucky the brake's on the right, but i got funny looks riding thru \nLondon with one leg held aloft.
I'm thinking about becoming a bike owner this year\nw/o any bike experience thus far.  I figure that getting a \ndecent used bike for under $1K the thing would pay for itself\nwhile I'm at grad school (car permits are $$$ where I'm going\nand who want's to ride a bus).  I'm looking for advice\non a first bike - best models/years.  I'm NOT looking for\nan old loud roaring thing that sounds like a monster.  The\nquit whirring of newer engines is more to my liking.\n\nApprec any advice.\n\nThanks,

mjs>No No No No!! All I am saying is that you don't even need to tell people\nmjs>the technique of countersteering, cos they will do it intuitively the first\nmjs>time they try to go round a corner.\n\nkarr>Are you sure?  Remember that you *can* get around corners without\nkarr>countersteering.  In fact, my Experienced Rider Course instructors\nkarr>claimed that they could get on behind a new rider and make the bike\nkarr>turn to whichever side they wanted just by shifting their weight\nkarr>around, even when the operator was trying to turn in the opposite\nkarr>direction.  (I admit I've never actually seen this.)\n\nI've experienced this, back when I was young(er) and (more) foolish...\n\nMy first bike used to track extremely true.  Going down the highway,\nI would set the throttle tension screw up enough to hold the gas\nsteady, slide back on the seat and lean against the backrest, riding\nwithout any hands.  If I needed to turn, I'd shift my weight into the\nturn, and lo and behold, the bike would turn, sans touching the bars!\nGranted, it wouldn't turn very fast, but it proves that you can turn\na bike without countersteering, at least not in terms of the input\nto the bar normally associated with countersteering.\n\nAs I've said, I know many people who think all you do is lean, and any\ninput they're giving to the bar is totally unconscious.  Whereas that\nmay be sufficient to get you down the road under normal circumstances,\npossibly for years at a stretch, I can't think of anybody who'd argue\nthat this is preferable to properly knowing how to manipulate the bar\nin a turn, regardless of what you want to call it.\n\nExcept maybe for Mr. Sixsmith...  ;^)\n\nMr. Bill

In three years of riding in the cities of San Jose,\nSanta Clara, and Sunnyvale I never came into any\nconflict with the local police over my lane splitting\nhabits (all three of these cities were listed earlier\nas being anti-splitting in one way or another).

:    I hate to admit this, and I'm still mentally kicking myself for it.\n: I rode the brand new K75RT home last Friday night.  100 miles in rain\n: and darkness.  No problems.  Got it home and put it on the center stand.\n:    The next day I pushed it off the center stand in preparation for going\n: over to a friend's house to pose.  You guessed it.  It got away from me\n: and landed on its right side.  \n:    Scratched the lower fairing, cracked the right mirror, and cracked the\n: upper fairing.  \n:    *DAMN* am I stupid!  It's going to cost me ~$200 to get the local\n: body shop to fix it.  And that is after I take the fairing off for them.\n: Still, that's probably cheaper than the mirror alone if I bought a \n: replacement from BMW.\n\nYou got off cheap.  My sister's ex-boyfriend was such an incessant pain\nin the ass about wanting to ride my bikes (no way, Jose) that I\nfinally took him to Lindner's BMW in New Canaan, CT last fall where\nI had seen a nice, used K100RS in perfect condition.  After telling\neveryone in the shop his Norton war stories from fifteen years ago,\nsigning the liability waiver, and getting his pre-flight, off he went...\n\nWell, not quite.  I walked out of a pizza shop up the street,\nfeeling good about myself (made my sister's boyfriend happy and got\nthe persistent wanker off my ass for good), heard the horrendous\nracket of an engine tortured to its red line and then a crash.  I\nsaw people running towards the obvious source of the disturbance...\nJeff laying under the BMW with the rear wheel spinning wildly and\nsomeone groping for the kill switch.  I stared in disbelief with\na slice hanging out of my mouth as Matty, the shop manager, slid\nup beside me and asked, "Friend of yours, Steve?".  "Shit, Matty,\nit could have been worse.  That could been my FLHS!"\n\nJeff hadn't made it 10 inches.  Witnesses said he lifted his feet\nbefore letting out the clutch and gravity got the best of him.\nJeff claimed that the clutch didn't engage.  Matty was quick.\nWhile Jeff was still stuttering in embarrassed shock he managed\nto snatch Jeff's credit card for a quick imprint and signature.  Twenty\nminutes later, when Jeff's color had paled to a flush, Matty\npresented him with an estimate of $580 for a busted right mirror\nand a hairline crack in the fairing.  That was for fixing the crack\nand masking the damaged area, not a new fairing.  Or he could buy the\nbike.\n\nI'm not sure what happened later as my sister split up with Jeff shortly\nafterwards (to hook up with another piece of work) except that Matty\ntold me he ran the charge through in December and that it went\nuncontested.
While shopping for a passenger helmet, I noticed that in many cases the\nexternal dimensions of the helmets were the same from S through XL.  The\ndifference was the amount of inside padding.\n\nMy solution was to buy a large helmet, and construct a removable liner \nfrom a sheet of .5" closed-cell foam and some satin (glued to the inside\nsurface).  The result is a reasonably snug fit on my smallest-headed pillion\nwith the liner in, and a comfortable fit on my largest-headed pillion with\nthe liner out.  Everyone else gets linered or not by best fit.\n\n\n\n--

]"Get the organization to act on it" is easy to say, but says little\n]about what one really can and should do.

Hey, man, you brought it up.  I agree completely, driving drunk is really\nstupid, and I understand and appreciate that you feel bad about it.  But\nDWI is endemic in our society.  It is a REAL problem.  And we, as \nmotorcyclists, can be in the worst of vulnerable positions around a drunk\ndriver.  (Alert readers might remember that last year I witnessed a DWI\naccident (right bloody in front of me), and was unable to save the life \nof one of the participants, as I reported here.)  Also, drunk driving by\nmotorcyclists is a prime cause of their injury and death, which raises the\ninsurance rates, forces stupidly restrictive laws, and turns the public\nagainst those of us who ride responsibly.\n\nIn my view, drunk driving should carry a mandatory prison sentence.\nIt is one of the traffic offenses which is NOT a public funds issue,\nbut a genuine safety issue.  So if YOU bring up the subject on rec.moto,\nadmitting having been caught DWI, and looking for sympathy over the \nconsequences, don't expect people to respond with warm wishes.

Sure you can do wheelies with a shaft drive bike. I had a BMW R100RS\nthat was a wheelie monster! Of course it didn't have the initial power\nburst to just twist it into the air - I had to pop the clutch. I also\nhad to replace front fork seals a few times as well. The fairing is a \nbit heavy to be slamming down onto those little stantion tubes all the\ntime. But let me give you fair warning: I trashed the ring/pinion gear\nin the final drive of my K75 (I assume) doing wheelies. And this was \nNO cheap fix either!! There is some kind of "slip" device in the shaft\nto prevent IT from breaking. Unfortunately, it didn't save the gears!\n\n  On the topic of wheelies, the other day I saw a kid on a big Hurricane\ndo a "stoppy"(?), or rear wheelie. Man, he had the rear end on this bike \nup about 2 feet off the ground at a traffic light. I don't recommend these\nactivities anymore (now that I'm an "old guy" with kids of my own) but\nit looked damn impressive!!\n\n  If you can't keep both tires on the ground, at least have 'em pointed\nin that direction! :-)
I spoke to a sales dweeb in 3X, a Ducati dealer here in Blighty, and he had\nnothing good to say about them... it appears they are waaaay underpowered,\n(basically, it's the 750/900 with a 400cc engine), and there have been some\nquality problems (rusty _frame_ !!).  Save your pennies... buy the 900 :)
For those of you who are thinking about fiamms, you might also want to think\nabout airhorns. I just installed a set of Bosch air horns ordered from \nDennis Kirk (pg. 282 of the latest catalog) on my '85 FJ1100. They are rated\nat 93db at 7 meters. I installed them using 10 gage wire from the battery to\nthe relay to the compressor to ground. My stock horn connectors fit the relay\npins just fine. I soldered the connections to the relay and compressor, and used\na crimp type battery connector and an inline 10amp fuse/connector from NAPA.\n	I installed the compressor just forward of the fuse box in the front\nfairing by tie wrapping between the steering head frame and the black steel tube\nframe used to support the front fairing. You have to remove the front fairing to\ndo this, but it fits outside of the frame but inside the fairing on the two\nvertical supports just in front of the fuses. Depending how tight your fairing\nfollows the frame, you should be able to fit it somewhere in the fairing.\nThe compressor is about 2" in diameter and about 5" long.\n	The relay mounted on the front of the steering head frame (it is small\nso there should be plenty of good places for it.\n	I found a perfect place for the horns that required only tie wraps to\nmount. The horns fit inside the front fairing/frame and stick out on either side\njust in front of the air scoops, but behind the turn signals. The back of the\nhorns point back towards the center of the bike and come real close to where\nthe gas tank connects to the front part of the frame. There is just enough\nroom to the outside to allow full lock to lock clearance, and there are nice\ncut outs in the frame for the back of the horn to go into.\n	The short horn is even with the fairing, and the long one sticks out\nabout an inch or so, but it is really not that noticable unless you look\nclosely. They end up pointing down slightly and maybe 30 degrees from straight\nahead (perfect for those cagers trying to change lanes into you).\n	If you have any other questions about the mounting, email, and I can try\nto explain better. If your bike is not red, then you may want to paint them\nfirst.\n	How do they work you ask? They are very, very, very *LOUD*. They sound\nmore like a european sports car than a truck, but a vast improvement over stock.\nI have used them at least daily since installing them, and the 10 amp fuse has\nnot blown yet (although, the duration of the horn blasts have been short).\n	I've repeatedly scared the shit out of my friends with them, even though\nthey know that I have the horns, they still jump. They are perfect for keeping\nthe pedestrians on the sidewalk.\nThe bottom line is they work, are loud enough to cause pain and suffering to\nthose stupid lane changing cages (as well as take a few years off their lives)\nand are relatively easy to install on the FJ. YMMV.

A piece of advice\nfor you:  don't be abrupt with the throttle.  No wheelies, accelerate a\nwee bit more slowly than usual.  Consciously worry about spitting her off\nthe back.  It's as much your job to keep her on the pillion as it is hers,\nand I guarantee she'll be put off by the bike ripping out from under her\nwhen you whack it open.  Keep the lean angles pretty tame the first time\nout too.  You and her need to learn each other's body English.  She needs\nto learn what your idea is about how to take the turn, and you need to\nlearn her idea of "shit!  Don't crash now!" so you don't work at cross\npurposes while leaned over.  You can work up to more aggressive riding over\ntime.\n\n	A very important thing:  tell her to put her hand against the tank\nwhen you brake--this could save you some severely crushed cookies.\n\nHave fun,

After reading the service manual for my bike (Suzuki GS500E--1990) I have\na couple of questions I hope you can answer:\n\nWhen checking the oil level with the dip stick built into the oil fill\ncap, does one check it with the cap screwed in or not?  I am more used to\nthe dip stick for a cage where the stick is extracted fully, wiped clean\nand reinserted fully, then withdrawn and read.  The dip stick on my bike\nis part of the oil filler cap and has about 1/2 inch of threads on it.  Do\nI remove the cap, wipe the stick clean and reinsert it with/without\nscrewing it down before reading?\n\nThe service manual calls for the application of Suzuki Bond No. 1207B on\nthe head cover.  I guess this is some sort of liquid gasket material.  do\nyou know of a generic (cheaper) substitute?\n\nMy headlight is a Halogen 60/55 W bulb.  Is there an easy, brighter\nreplacement bulb available?  Where should I look for one?\n\nAs always, I very much appreciate your help.  The weather in Philadelphia\nhas finally turned WARM.  This weekend I saw lotsa bikes, and the riders\nALL waved.  A nice change of tone from what Philadelphia can be like. . . .\n\nChris

I feel childish.\n\n\nWho mentioned dirtbikes? We're talking highway speeds here. If you go 70mph\non your dirtbike then feel free to contribute.\n\n\nBecause it wouldn't be a Jeep if it didn't. A friend of mine just bought one\nand it has more warning stickers than those little 4-wheelers (I guess that's\nbecuase it's a big 4 wheeler). Anyway, it's written in about ten places that\nthe windshield should remain up at all times, and it looks like they've made\nit a pain to put it down anyway, from what he says. To be fair, I do admit\nthat it would be a similar matter to drive a windscreenless Jeep on the \nhighway as for bikers. They may participate in this discussion, but they're\nprobably few and far between, so I maintain that this topic is of interest\nprimarily to bikers.\n\n\nNotice how Ed picked on the more insignificant (the lower case part) of the \ntwo parts of the statement.

My experience of \nbicycling with contact lenses and sunglasses says that non-wraparound \nsunglasses do almost nothing to keep the crap out of ones eyes.\n\n\nOk, ok, fine, whatever you say, but lets make some attmept to stick to the\npoint. I've been out on the road where I had to stop every half hour to clean\nmy shield there were so many bugs (and my jacket would be a blood-splattered\nmess) and I'd see guys with shorty helmets, NO GOGGLES, long beards and tight\nt-shirts merrily cruising along on bikes with no windscreens. Lets be really\nspecific this time, so that even Ed understands. Does anbody think that \nsplattering bugs with one's face is fun, or are there other reasons to do it?\nImage? Laziness?

If he's not, I will.  Put two riders on identical machines.  It's the\none who knows what he's doing, and why, that will be faster.  It *may*\nbe possible to improve your technique if you have no idea what it is,\nthrough trial and error, but it is not very effective methodology.\nOnly by understanding the technique of steering a motorcycle can one\nimprove on that technique (I hold that this applies to any human\nendeavor).\n\n\nDo you consider an understanding of the physics of traction absurd?\nAre you seriously suggesting that one can form a traction management\npolicy without understanding what it is or what factors increase or\ndecrease available traction?  Braking?\n\nIt is highly unlikely that any biker is going to develop his maximum\nswerving ability without any knowledge of turning techniques.  For most\nof his riding life this may not be a problem, but in an emergency\nsituation it is very definately placing him at a disadvantage.\n\n\nI disagree.  The existance and immense success of riding courses which\nteach the technique indicate that the concept can be taught in a manner\nthat is neither confusing, nor detracts from any other aspects of the\ncourse.\n\n\nPerhaps, but in the ensuing discussion, you strayed far from that\npoint, to claim that knowledge of steering technique is irrelevant to a\nrider's ability.  I find this assertion ludicrous.

I don't think the 550 sold very well - most North Americans who ride a standard\nrather than a sport bike usually want something bigger. People walk into the\ndealership, look at the 550 and the 750 and say, "I might as well spring the\nextra bucks for the bigger engine."
DS>From: viking@iastate.edu (Dan Sorenson)\n\n\nDS>>Riding up the hill leading to my\nDS>>house, I encountered a liver-and-white Springer Spaniel (no relation to\nDS>>the Springer Softail, or the Springer Spagthorpe, a close relation to\nDS>>the Spagthorpe Viking).\n\nDS>        I must have missed the article on the Spagthorpe Viking.  Was\nDS>that the one with the little illuminated Dragon's Head on the front\nDS>fender, a style later copied by Indian, and the round side covers?\n\nNo. Not at all. The Viking was a trick little unit made way back when\n(forties? fifties?) when Spag was trying to make a go of it in racing.\nThe first iteration (the Springer) was a boxer twin, very similar to Max\nFriz's famous design, but with an overhead "point cam" (see below for\nmore on the valvetrain). The problem was that the thing had no ground\nclearance whatsoever. The solution was to curve the cylinder bores, so\nthat the ground clearance was substantially increased:\n\n\n      ==@==   <-Springer motor (front)\n                 Viking motor (front) ->   \=@=/\n\nThis is roughly the idea, except that the bores were gradually curved\naround a radius, as the pistons were loath to make a sharp-angled turn\nin the middle of their stroke. The engine also had curved connecting\nrods to accomodate the stroke.\n\nThe engine stuck out so far because of its revolutionary (and still\nunique) overhead cam system. Through the use of clever valve timing and\nand extrordinarily trick valve linkage, only a single cam lobe was\nrequired to drive both overhead valves.\n\nJust as revolutionary was the hydraulic valve actuation, which used a\npressurized stream of oil to power the "waterwheel" which kept the lobe\nspinning over. One side effect that required some rather brutal\nengineering fixes was that until the engine's oil pressure came up to\nnormal, the engine's valve timing would be more or less random,\nresulting in some impressive start-up valve damage. The solution was a\nlittle hand crank that pressurized the cases before you started the\nbeast, remarkably similar to the system used in new Porsches to\npressurize the oil system before the car is started (the cage, however,\nuses an electric oil pump. Wimps).\n\nDespite this fix, the engine had a nasty propensity for explosively\nfiring its valves into the pistons when a cylinder would temporarily\nlose a bit of oil pressure in a corner. The solution was to run even\nhigher oil pressures and change the gaskets and seals regularly. This\nwas feasible because it was a racing engine.\n\nWith just a single overhead lobe, and no pushrod/shaft/chain towers\nbecause of the hydraulic system, the head of the engine came to an\nalmost perfect point:\n\n                    /\\n                   /()\   <-lobe\n                  / XX \  <-complex linkage (not shown due to\n valvestems ->   / \  / \    complexity)\n                |  |   | |\n                |  |===| |\n                    =0=  <---piston\n                     |\n                             Note that the tip was not truly vertical\n                             (it was at about a 70 degree angle to the\n                             ground, and this drawing doesn't show the\n                             curvature because there was none in the\n                             head itself. The bore curve would start\n                             about where the cylinder bore disappears in\n                             this diagram\n\n\nThe effect of the pointy heads on top of a pair of gently (pundits of\nthe day even said sensuously) curved cylinders was much like a pair of\nfinned Viking horns poking out from beneath the gas tank. Thus, the\nname.\n\nThe Vik was a moderately successful racer, lightning fast when it\nworked, but plagued by problems relating to its revolutionary\ntechnology. Eventually, it was dumped when Spag finally realized that\nracing was not where the Spagthorpe name would be made. The machines\nwere raced for another year or two by privateers, and their fate\n(approximately six Vikings were made, plus one or possibly two\nSpringers. Confusing the issue is one old Spag staffer who swears up and\ndown that this machine was tooled for production, and that as many as\ntwenty or thirty machines may have come off the line. However, no modern\nrecord of a production Viking has survived, and most motorcycle\nhistorians discount this story.\n\nRyan Cousinetc.|1982 Yamaha Vision XZ550 -Black Pig of Inverness|Live to Ride\nKotRB          |1958 AJS 500 C/S -King Rat                      |to Work to\nDoD# 0863      |I'd be a squid if I could afford the bike...    |Flame to\nryan.cousineau@compdyn.questor.org  |   Vancouver, BC, Canada   |Live . . .\n\n\n * SLMR 2.1a * If you aren't sliding, you aren't riding.

Now, I am jumping into the middle of this thread so I may not know\nwhat y'all been talking about, but I have a few comments:\n\n\nThere are a number of other factors that are very important, the three\nbiggest being air velocity, air momentum and shock waves.\nVelocity stacks have been used for years and are now being used inside\nof stock airboxes on a number of bikes.  At a tuned engine rpm, the\nstacks can greatly increase the speed, and thus momentum of the air\nrushing in.\nAir momentum is critical in getting good air intake: the momentum of\nthe air stack outside the combustion chamber will force its way inside\nlong after the piston has begun its compressive up-stroke.\nShock waves are used to induce air intake and to prevent fresh air from\nescaping out the exzhaust ports.  Shock waves are the product of expansion\nchambers or any other means of presenting a 'wall' (opening or closing)\nto the air in motion.  Beyond this I am lost in the mystery of how they\ndesign for shock waves.

If you have something that weighs that same as the 750, go \nfor the extra cubes.  \n\nI think that fact that I own a GTV-6 shows that I don't care about maximum\npower (it's no slug though) to the exclusion of everything else.

The V-max goes in a strait line like shit shrough a goose.\nIn the corners, I'd rather ride a Honda 305 Dream.
While I agree with you on that formal training is essential for safe riding,\nI disagree strongly with your original point. The point of formal training \nmust be to prepare riders for the road. Preparedness is in my opinion\nto know as much as possible. So, to exclude some aspects of riding a bike \nin a course is wrong IMHO. Now to countersteering in particular.\nCountersteering is something that must be trained. A common reaction among \nnew bikers (or bicycle riders) in an emergency situation, is to steer the \nmotorcycle like a bicycle. As we know this makes the motorcycle go in the\ndirection opposite to what was intended. Needless to say, this is dangerous.\nI have a specific example: A rider in a left turn. The rider thinks he/she\nis to close to the right shoulder of the road, and tries to steer the \nmotorcycle to the left by pulling the left handle and pushing the right \nhandle. The motorcycle straightens up and goes off the road. \nA worse scenario: The same rider, same turn. In the middle of the turn\nthe rider sees a truck coming towards him/her. The panicking rider tries\nto steer the motorcycle away from the truck and crashes right into it.\n\nThe main function of a riding course is to teach how to avoid emergency \nsituations, AND what to do if in one. Thus, the knowledge (and training) of\ncountersteering is IMHO a must in any riding course.

Three, actually.  I believe I discussed countersteering a horse\nbefore.\n\nBasically, there are two ways to steer a horse, plow-rein and\nneck-rein.  Plow-reining steers him by keeping the reins separate, and\nyou pull in the direction you wish to go.  Neck-reining steers a horse\nby holding the reins together in one hand, and pulling against the\nhorse's neck in the direction you wish to go.  When training a\nplow-steering horse to neck-rein, one technique is to cross the reins\nunder his necks.  Thus, when neck-reining to the left, the right rein\npulls against the right side of the neck, but the left side of the bit\n(which the horse is used to from his plow-reining days).\n\nAre you sorry you asked yet?

Well, I used to get mad, and either try to communicate my anger to jerks,\nor to, uhm, educate them in how to improve their manners in traffic.\nNow I just try to get them off my tail.\n\nIn heavy traffic I slow down a bit, mostly so I have more buffer zone in\nfront to balance the minimal buffer behind, but I also often find that the \njerk behind will notice traffic moving faster in other lanes, switch\ninto one of them, and pass me - which is fine, because then I can keep a\nbetter eye on the jerk from behind, while looking ahead, rather than\nfrom in front, while splitting my attention between ahead and the mirrors.\n\nIn traffic so heavy that there is no way for the jerk to pass,\nI might pull over, as if to look for a street number or name,\n(still ignoring the jerk) just to get the jerk off my tail.  \n\nIf this all sounds, well, wimpy or un-Denizenly or pessimistic, or perhaps \n(for any psych types) passive-aggressive, consider that I prefer to get\nmy adrenaline jollies from riding, rather than from yelling at jerks.  \n\nA ride can improve my whole day, while yelling at a jerk is likely (for\nme) to ruin my ride or my day with my own anger.  In the worst case,\nyelling at the jerk could ruin my life - since even a tiny jerk in a\ncage behind me is better armed (with the cage) than I am on a bike. \n\nOn the other hand, you might try subtly arranging to be the last\nvehicle to legally cross one or more intersections, leaving the jerk\nwaiting for cross traffic (and thus off your tail), or crossing\nillegally (hopefully in front of the waiting police).\n\nLike almost everything here, your choices and mileage will vary.

Hmmmmmm....put your butt in the seat and follow the road signs?
If we do, I think you'd loose.  Sure, you're hand's already on the\nthrottle.  And your thumb is already near the horn button.  Pushing the\nhorn button is one simple move.  Revving the throttle requires either\nengaging the clutch, or accelerating.  The first is a more complex\nmanuver than a simple horn button push, and the second ain't too bright\nwhen there is a potential hazard ahead.  Besides, the unique sound of a\nhorn is more effective in attracting the attention of BDI cagers than\nis the sound of an engine, which is what they expect to hear (you are\non the road!).\n\nAs is usually the case, a single anecdote hardly constitutes sound\nsafety procedure.\n\nThe answer is 161.33 feet.
I'll second that.  In addition, I find my hazards to be more\noften used than my horn.  At speeds below 40mph on the interstates,\nquite common in mountains with trucks, some states require flashers.\nIn rural areas, flashers let the guy behind you know there is a tractor\nwith a rather large implement behind it in the way.

I need some advice on having someone ride pillion with me on my 750 Ninja.\n   This will be the the first time I've taken anyone for an extended ride\n   (read: farther than around the block  :-).  We'll be riding some twisty, \n   fairly bumpy roads (the Mines Road-Mt.Hamilton Loop for you SF Bay Areans).\n\nI'd say this is a very bad idea - you should start out with something\nmuch mellower so that neither one of you get in over your head.\nThat particular road requires full concentration - not the sort of\nthing you want to take a passenger on for the first time.\n\nOnce you both decide that you like riding together, and want to do\nsomething longer and more challenging, *then* go for a hard core road\nlike Mines-Mt. Hamilton.\n\nIn any case, it's *your* (moral) responsibility to make sure that she\nhas proper gear that fits - especially if you're going sport\nriding.

Hi boys and girls.  I just bought a Beemer R80GS and realized abruptly that \nI am a grad student.  I first sold my truck yesterday but I need to sell my \nZephyr too.\n\nIf I can sell it this month, great ... insurance and tags both run out in\na couple of weeks.  Otherwise I'll tag and insure it and see what happens.\n\nIt's a very sweet bike.  6100 miles, almost all highway (AZ-WY-CO last summer,\nplus some great rides between here and the Border.  Purchased new exactly\none year ago (Apr '92), it's a '90 model.  It has a good fairing and a\nluggage rack.  Red; very clean.  Perfect maintenance, no bullshit.   I'll spare\nany further details other than to say (1) I want to keep it, and (2) somebody\n5'7" +/- 5" will fit it like a charm.  Not a bike for big people, but not a\nsmall bike.  Standard, upright positioning and good-looking.  Smooth power,\ngreat brakes, good Karma.\n\n				- Erik

Personally, I think Jeffy-Poo was still smarting more from the third degree\nburns he suffered after April 1st last year rather than the supposed burns\nthat he suffered in "the joke".  Granted I was one of those people that were\ntaken in by it and I was certainly concerned...and then pissed at him for \npulling such a thing (which I made known to him).\n\nBut then again, for an April Fool "joke" I would also go on record as saying\nthat it was the best orchestrated one I've ever seen and it certainly sucked\na LOT of people into believing it 8-( 8-| 8-\ 8-)...\n\n"sick" - "twisted"???

I have a problem with the battery on my '83 Honda CB650 NightHawk.\nEvery week or so it is dead and I have to recharge it.

Hello all,\n\nOn my bike I have hazard lights (both front and back turn signals\nflash).  Since I live in NJ and commute to NYC there are a number of\ntolls one must pay on route.  Just before arriving at a toll booth I\nswitch the hazards on.  I do thisto warn other motorists that I will\nbe taking longer than the 2 1/2 seconds to make the transaction.\nTaking gloves off, getting money out of coin changer/pocket, making\ntransaction, putting gloves back on takes a little more time than the\naverage cager takes to make the same transaction of paying the toll.\nI also notice that when I do this cagers tend to get the message and\nusually go to another booth.\n\nMy question, is this a good/bad thing to do?\n\nAny others tend to do the same?\n\nJust curious

*cough* *choke*  WHAT?!?  if a cop gave me a ticket for "sounding" like\ni was speeding i'd probably show up in court without a lawyer simply\nbecause "sounding" like speeding is ridiculous.  if i was found guilty\ni'd appeal and then show up with a lawyer.\n\nif a cop doesn't do one of:\n\nVASCAR (from car or plane)\nRADAR, LIDAR, other electronic speed measuring device\npace me\n\nand i'm within 15mph or so of the limit i'd go to court.  i can accept a\ncop "seeing" me going excessively fast (like 25+ over the limit) but\n"he looked like he was going 70 or so in a 55 zone" is not "beyond a\nreasonable doubt".  granted i may well lose the case but 70 in a 55 measured\nby eye???  take it to court for sure.
Dogs will chase anything that moves. I have two dogs and they love\nchasing me when I ride off. They will also chase any car that passes\n, running along the footpath/sidewalk at up to 60kph. They don't\nseem to go after trucks though, the size difference must be a factor.\n\nIt also works in my favour though, I can exercise them quite easily\nby riding 1/2 mile up the road and back a few times.

Well, my driveway is... Just keep an eye out for the blue GLH Turbo that \nutilizes the "hit-the-ground-running" merging technique. \nAt least I don't have a dog that you need worry about.\n\nLast week while entering a sand/gravel covered intersection in the country, \nI caught something unkosher out of the corner of my eye (you know that \ndisgusting sensation when great, as-of-yet unidentified, evil is about to \nintimately acquaint itself with you-- kind of like knowing that that darkening \nshadow around you just cannot possibly be anything even remotely good, because\nit probably has something to do with a Boeing 747 behaving, gravitationally\nspeaking, much like a brick).

Tunes like\na dream, just like they say!  The stock carb (non-adjustable) was so\nlean that it was gasping and spluttering for gas sometimes, and even\nbackfiring into the intake manifold.

Call the AMA and ask for\nJim Bensberg (sp?) or any one else in their Legislative Office.\nThey will recound the many public places that they had to bring\nto court to reverse their ban on bikes.  That includes everything\nfrom public parks to full cities.  There are probably a few fights\non their books as we now speak.

No... you can do this? Really? The other morning I went to do a lane change\non the freeway and looked in my mirror, theer was a car there, but far\nenough behind. I looked again about 3-5 seconds later, car still in same\nposition, i.e. not accelerating. I triple check with a head turn and decide\nI have plenty of room, so I do it, accelerating.

You and the Beav should lighten up (esp the Beav).  I agree that\nDUI/DWI is serious.  We should have reasonable laws, strict\nenforcement, and tough sentences.  But, Andrew did not\npost "looking for sympathy over the consequences."  He posted\nasking for advice because he had an extremely high quote.  His\npost was obviously valid because he later found insurance for LESS.\nHe noted why he was in his predicament but did not defend in\nany way drunk driving (and has renounced drunk driving).  There\nare too many repeat offenders to worry about and other BDC.\nWhy try to make this person who is no longer part of the problem\nan outcast?  He has paid his debt to society.  Step off the high\nhorse.  We have all been irresponsible in the past.\n\nWith that said, I'm guilty of the same type of hostility towards\nrapists.  I think it comes because I feel the punishment is not\nsevere enough.  The same may be true of DWI/DUI. If that is the\ncase, then it is our stinkin' gubment we need to change.  If \nwe had a reasonable law about DWI/DUI with a stiff penalty\nthen fewer people would do it.  \n\nAt any rate, Andrew as paid his debt as defined by the law.\nIf you think that debt is actually greater than the law mandates, \ntell your 'representatives'.\n\nJack Waters II\nDoD#1919

Personally, I follow the no alcohol rule when I'm on a bike.  My view is that you have to be in such a high degree of control that any alcohol could be potentially hazardous to my bike!  If I get hurt it's my own fault, but I don't want to wreck my Katana.  I developed this philosophy from an impromptu *experiment*.  I had one beer at 6:00 in the evening and had volleyball practice at 7:00.  I wasn't even close to leagle intoxication, but I couldn't perform even the most basic things until 8:30!  This made\n\n\n\n me think about how I viewed alcohol and intoxication.  You may seem fine, but your reactions may be affected such that you'll be unable to recover from hitting a rock or even just a gust of wind.  I greatly enjoy social drinking but, for me, it just doesn't mix with riding.

I can't imagine finding a one-piece\nsize that would have fit correctly, as even the 2 piece has it's\nproblems (strange, since my V-Pilot jacket fits great all over, and\nwhen I tried the matching pants, they fit like a glove as well).\n\nI can only assume the models Aero Design uses to design its suits are\nin some way different from us real folks.\n\nAlso, even though it's related to convienience, you look pretty damn\nwierd walking around with the tops and bottoms while running errands.\nI've gotten some really suspicious looks, and sweated a lot while in a\nstore wearing the whole suit, since you can't fit the top and bottom\nin any motorcycle storage device yet devised (except the trunk in my\nsidecar rig :-).  With the two piece, I unzip the pants (I generally\nleave the two pieces zipped together, primarily because the pants fall\ndown unless I pull the cheesy elastic belt-type band real tight),\nstuff them in one of my spacious BMW saddlebags (the pants just fit),\nand run errands just wearing the jacket.  Actually, if I know I'll be\nrunning errands, I just wear my V-Pilot jacket, but that's just me...\n\nAs far as crash protection, I'd say that both suits are probably\nequal.  It seems that for weather protection, if anything the 2 piece\nprovides a little more because of the jacket overlapping the pants by\n3 inches.  The 2 piece is probably a little less comfortable around\nthe waist, just because of the extra layer of stuff, but maybe not.\n\nSo I'd have to vote for the two piece.  Despite the slightly odd fit,\nI still find the suit the most versatile piece of riding clothing I\nown.  Wouldn't go long distance without it.\n\nKen Wallich <wallich@ncd.com> \nken@wallich.com ~ kmw@al.org ~ [...]decwrl!vixie!amber!ken
As I won't be able to make the Joust this summer (Job related time \nconflict :'^{   ), I plan instead on going to the Rider Rally in \nKnoxville.\n\nI'll be leaving from Chicago. and generally plan on going down along\nthe Indiana/Illinois border into Kentucky and then Tennessee.  I would \nbe very interested in hearing suggestions of roads/routes/areas that \nyou would consider "must ride" while on the way to Knoxville.\n\nI can leave as early as 5/22 and need to arrive in Knoxville by 6PM\non 5/25.  That leaves me a pretty good stretch of time to explore on \nthe way.\n\nBy the way if anyone else is going, and would like to partner for the \nride down, let me know.  I'll be heading east afterward to visit family, \nbut sure don't mind company on the ride down to the Rally.  Depending on \nweather et al. my plan is motelling/tenting thru the trip.\n\nFrom the Rally I'll be heading up the Blue Ridge Parkway, then jogging\ninto West Va (I-77) to run up 219 -> Marlington, 28 -> Petersburg, \n55E -> I-81/I-66E.  After this point the route is presently undetermined\ninto Pennsylvania, New York?, and back to Chicago (by 6/6).  Suggestions \nfor these areas would be of great interest also.\n\nMany thanks for your ideas,\n\nEnjoy,

Take this one step further ...\n\nNever dilly-dally in that rear 1/4 of either side of a cage - when you pass\nmake it as POSITIVE as possible and if you can't pass fully, at least make\nsure that if you attempt it you can make the driver aware of you by at least\ngetting into his area of vision.\n\nThis also applies to merging into another lane after making a pass - do it\nas POSITIVELY as possible ... and what I "try" to do is look in the rear view\nand then over my shoulder.  And after I've done that ACCELERATE into the \nlane so that you have a speed cushion should you have missed seeing a \npotential BDI that's trying to do the same thing as you ... or worse (ie:\nhe may have been behind you, saw you made the pass successfully but YOU aren't\nGOING FAST ENOUGH to suite him so he tries to go around you on the right).\n\nRide with four eyes...\n\nRich
Watch out.  Often when some scumbag steals the cover, that means\n   that they were or are looking to steal the bike.  In my case, I\n   had a faded cover stolen off a bmw R100RS that was stashed in an\n   apartment carport and not visible from the street.  They evidently\n   decided the beemer wasn't worth stealing, but did try the next night to\n   steal a Honda Hurricane 600 parked in the next apartment building.\n   A neighbor heard them wheeling it out and called the cops.\n\n\nI know this is just setting myself up, but this is actually one of the\nthings that is really good about BMW bikes.  From all accounts I've\nheard practically no one steals BMWs. Probably it is similar for Moto\nGuzzis and other relative "exotics" since there isn't a large demand\nfor parts and the bike would be much easier to track down. It seems\nthat the most stolen bikes are Harleys and 600cc Jap sport bikes.
This tactic depends for its effectiveness on the dog's conformance to\na "psychological norm" that may not actually apply to a particular dog.\nI've tried it with some success before, but it won't work on a Charlie Manson\ndog or one that's really, *really* stupid.

It is certainly possible, and quite easy in most cases, especially\non two-strokes.  It's very common to do this on bikes where the\ncylinder-mounting through-studs don't prevent the cylinder from being\nremoved with the engine in the frame.\n    I did this when I assembled the top end on my Indian, which was\neasier yet because it does not have through-studs.  Base flange studs,\nand separate head bolts, dontchaknow.\n    You have to use a little foresight, rags, duct tape, etc. to keep\nclips from falling in, clothespins, hoseclamps, etc. to support the\ncylinder while you're inserting the pins.\n    (Are these called Gudgeon Pins in the UK?

(not that logic has anything to do with it, but...)\nI can see the liability of putting stickers on the car while it was moving,\nor something, but it's the BDI that chooses to start and then drive the car\nin a known unsafe condition that would (seem to be) liable. Furthermore, they\nwould have had the last chance to avoid an unsafe situation, which is an\nadditional factor in attributing "blame".\n\nAnyway, stickers on the window are less effective... no one has any problem\ntaking a blade to a window to remove a stubborn sticker, but it's a different\nstory with that that nice paint job on the door....\n\n	*jeff*

A traffic citation is an accusation of having committed a crime.\nThat's why they have to go through the motions of having a trial if you\nwant one, you are still innocent until proven guilty.  Cops are not the\nonly ones who can accuse people of committing crimes, anyone who\nwitnesses a crime can do so.\n\nGo to the Highway Patrol and explain the situation, give them a\ndescription of the car and the license number, and tell them the\nspecific violation of the law which you witnessed and wish to prosecute\n(ie, search the Vehicle Code and have the section number handy).  Fill\nout the ticket and sign it.  It will go through the same system any\nticket a cop writes goes through.  If contested, you will have to\nappear in court to prosecute.  Your word will not carry the same weight\nas a cop's.
I am happy to say that some Harley riders in our area are better than most\nthat are flamed about here: I (riding a lowly sport bike, no less) and my\ngirlfriend were the recipient of no less than twenty waves from a group of\nat least twenty-five Harley riders.  I was leading a group of about four\nsport bikes at the time (FJ1200/CBR900RR/VFR750).  I initiated *some* of the\nwaves, but not all.  It was a perfect day, and friendly riders despite some\nbrand differences made it all the better...
}>More like those who use their backs instead of their minds to make\n}>their living who are usually ignorant and intolerant of anything outside\n}>of their group or level of understanding.\n\nThere seems to be some confusion between rednecks and white trash.\nThe confusion is understandable, as there is substantial overlap\nbetween the two sets. Let me see if I can clarify:\n\nRednecks: Primarily use their backs instead of their minds to make a\n	living. Usually somewhat ignorant (by somebody's standards,\n	anyway) because they have never held education above basic\n	reading/writing/math skills to be that important to their\n	eventual vocation. Note I did not say stupid, just ignorant.\n	(They might be stupid, but then so are some high percentage\n	of any group).\n\nWhite trash: "White trash fit the stereotype referred to by the\n	word 'nigger' better than any black person I ever met, only\n	with the added 'bonus' that white trash are mean as hell."\n	-- my father. Genuinely lazy (not just out of work or under-\n	qualified), good-for-nothing, dishonest, white people who are\n	mean as snakes. The "squeal like a pig" boys in _Deliverance_\n	may or may not have been rednecks, but they were sure as hell\n	white trash.\n\nWhite trash are assuredly intolerant of anything outside of their\ngroup or level of understanding. Rednecks may or may not be.

I've never heard\nanyone discussing this idea, so maybe there's some reason why it isn't\nso great.

And, since she has to make this difficult ( 8-) ),\nshe would prefer not to end up with a cruiser.  So there's bonus points\nfor listing tiny standards.\n\nI seem to remember a thread with a point similar to this passing through\nseveral months ago.  Did anybody keep that list?\n\nThanks!

I'm about to undertake changing the fork seals on my '88 EX500.

Considering the dealers around here didn't\nhave the Clymer manual, fork seals, and a turn signal assembly in stock I\nreally doubt they have these tools in stock and I'd really like to get this\ndone this week.

WHAT IS THE FLANK DRIVE EVERYONES TALKING ABOUT?
Well, simply put, drinking is irrelavent.  Driving drunk is indefensable and\nunforgivable.  There is a large differnece.\n\nBut, then, with an attitude like yours, I expect you'll be dead soon.  I just\nhope you don't take a human being out with you.
Some will, and others will steer with their tuchuses. I don't know how much\nthe teaching of countersteering in the beginner course really helps the\ntuchus steerers. I was one, I guess that I always steered a bicycle that way,\nand I only got the hang of countersteering in normal riding *after* the course.\nI could do the countersteering swerves in the course no problem, but I only\nstarted using it in my normal riding when I decided that my turning at speed\n(off-ramps and the like) was a lot more difficult that it should have been.\nI knew how it works (although that's currently up for debate) definitely knew\n*that* it works, as I could do it in swerves, but only figured it out later\nin my normal riding. Just a data point. I think that it's not a bad idea to\nbring the idea up, but it's best to let everyone tuchus-steer for the first\nlesson or two, so they can learn to shift gears before they have to worry\nabout proper handlebar technique.\n\n\nI have. In our beginner course we had passenger training. Sometime during\nthe lesson the instructor would hop on the back of the bike, and the student\nwould take him for a ride. If the student did not give the instructor the\n"you are a sack of potatoes" passenger speech, the instructor would steer\nthe bike and make a general nuisance of himself. It was amusing to watch,\nI'm just happy that it didn't happen to me.
This is not good advice.  A couple of years I was involved in a low-speed\ngetoff in which I landed on my back on the pavement.  My head (helmeted)\nhit the pavement with a "clunk", leaving a couple of dings and chips in the\npaint at the point of impact, but no other visible damage.  I called the\nhelmet manufacturer and inquired about damage.  They said that the way a\nfiberglass shell works is to first give, then delaminate, then crack.\nThis is the way fiberglass serves to spread the force of the impact over a\nwider area.  After the fiberglass has done its thing, the crushable foam\nliner takes care of absorbing (hopefully) the remaining impact force.\nThey told me that the second stage of fiberglass functionality (delamination\nof the glass/resin layers) can occur with NO visible signs, either inside or\noutside of the helmet.  They suggested that I send them the helmet and they\nwould inspect it (including X-raying).  I did so.  They sent back the helmet\nwith a letter stating that that they could find no damage that would\ncompromise the ability of the helmet to provide maximum protection.\n(I suspect that this letter would eliminate their being able to claim\nprior damage to the helmet in the event I were to sue them.)\n\nThe bottom line, though, is that it appears that a helmets integrity\ncan be compromised with no visible signs.  The only way to know for sure\nis to send it back and have it inspected.  Note that some helmet\nmanufacturers provide inspections services and some do not.  Another point\nto consider when purchasing a lid.

Yup.  Unfortunately, as has been pointed out, the cost of insurance\ndoes NOT go down with No Fault.  The crappiest drivers make out like bandits\nbecause they no longer have to bear the responsibility of paying for\ninsurance that they have boosted in price for themselves by being crappy\ndrivers.  The good drivers now pay through the nose to spread the cost of\nthe crappy drivers' actions, and that's not fair.\n\n	Any plan that caps rates for crappy drivers is inherently a piece of\nshit, because the rest of us end up paying more.\n\n	Any plan that uses speeding tickets as a basis for raising rates is\nalso a piece of shit as it is based upon the lie that faster drivers are\ninherently less safe than slower drivers, and the NHTSA disproved that two\nyears ago now.\n\nLater,
& Can somebody tell me what all the letter spesifications on motorcycle models \n& really mean. \n& Example: What means the C, the B and the R in Honda CBR. - Or the V, S, G, L \n& and P in Suzuki VS750GLP\n\nHonda:  a "V" designates a V engine street bike. "VF" for V-4, "VT" for V-twin.\n"CB" is a street bike with an parallel twin or inline 4-cylinder engine.\n"R" used to mean race bike, but is now also used to mean sport bike.\n"CL" was for the old steet scramblers-street bikes with high pipes\n"CM" was a "custom" street bike\n"CR" is dirt only two strokes\n"XL" is dual purpose bike\n"XR" was dirt only four stroke, but now can be a dual purpose bike if it has\nan "L" as a suffix.\n"GL" is a touring bike
A Sea Doo is a boat. It turns by changing the angle of the duct behind the\npropeller. A waterski bike looks like a motorcycle but has a ski where each\nwheel should be. Its handlebars are connected through a familiar looking\nsteering head to the front ski. It handles like a motorcycle.
As you point out, the experiments would be difficult. But we know\nenough about the physics of the situation to do some calculations.\nThere are in fact three effects contributing to leaning the bike over\nto begin a turn.\n\n	1. Gyro effect causing a torque which twists the bike over.\n\n	2. Contact patch having shifted to one side, causing bike to fall over.\n\n	3. Contact patch being accelerated to the side, causing a\n	torque which twists the bike over.\n\nTake an average bike/rider, average bike wheel, and at speeds of 5,\n15, and 50 mph (say) calculate how much twist of the bars would be\nneeded to produce (say) 20 degrees of lean in (say) 2 seconds by each\neffect alone. My guess is that at slow speeds 2 is dominant, and at\nhigh speeds 3 is dominant, and at all speeds 1 contributes not far off\nbugger all, relatively speaking.\n\nBy the way, a similar problem is this: how does a runner who wants to\nrun round a corner get leaned into the corner fast? Is there a running\ngroup where we could start "counter-footing" arguments and have them\nall falling over as they tried to work out how they go round corners?

Several years ago, while driving a cage, a dog darted out at a quiet\nintersection right in front of me but there was enough distance\nbetween us so I didn't have to slow down. However, a 2nd dog\nsuddenly appeared and collided with my right front bumper and\nthe force of the impact was enough to kill that Scottish Terrier.\n\nApparently, it was following the 1st dog. Henceforth, if a dog\ndecides to cross the street, keep an eye out for a 2nd dog as\nmany dogs like to travel in pairs or packs. \n\nI've yet to experience a dog chasing me on my black GL1200I which\nhas a pretty loud OEM horn (not as good as Fiamms, but good enuff)\nbut the bike is large and heavy enough to run right over one of\nthe smaller nippers while the larger ones would have trouble\ngetting my leg between the saddlebags and engine guards. I'd\ndef feel more vulnerable on my '68 Trump as that'd be easier\nleg chewing target for those mongrels.\n\nIf there's a persistent dog running after bikers despite\ncomplaints to the owner I wouldn't be adverse to running\nover it with my truck as a dogs life isn't worth much IMHO\ncompared to a child riding a bike who gets knocked to the\nground by said dog and dies from a head injury. \n\nAny dog in the neighborhood that's vicious or a public menace\nrunning about unleashed is fair game as road kill candidate.

It's normal for the BMW K bikes to use a little oil in the first few thousand \nmiles.  I don't know why.  I've had three new K bikes, and all three used a\nbit of oil when new - max maybe .4 quart in first 1000 miles; this soon quits\nand by the time I had 10,000 miles on them the oil consumption was about zero.\nI've been told that the harder you run the bike (within reason) the sooner\nit stops using any oil.

For discussion purposes, I will ignore dynamic effects like pulses\nin the exhaust pipe, and try to paint a useful mental picture.\n\n1.  Unless an engine is supercharged, the pressure available to force\nair into the intake tract is _atmospheric_.  At the time the intake\nvalve is opened, the pressure differential available to move air is only\nthe difference between the combustion chamber pressure (left over after\nthe exhaust stroke) and atmospheric.  As the piston decends on the\nintake stroke, combustion chamber pressure is decreased, allowing\natmospheric pressure to move more air into the intake tract.  At no time\ndoes the pressure ever become "negative", or even approach a good\nvacuum.\n\n2.  At the time of the exhaust valve closing, the pressure in the\ncombustion chamber is essentially the pressure of the exhaust system up\nto the first major flow restriction (the muffler).  Note that the volume\nof gas that must flow through the exhaust is much larger than the volume\nthat must flow through the intake, because of the temperature\ndifference and the products of combustion.\n\n3.  In the last 6-8 years, the Japanese manufacturers have started\npaying attention to exhaust and intake tuning, in pursuit of almighty\nhorsepower.  At this point in time, on high-performance bikes,\nsubstitution of an aftermarket free-flow air filter will have almost\nzero affect on performance, because the stock intake system flows very\nwell anyway.  Substitution of an aftermarket exhaust system will make\nvery little difference, unless (in general) the new exhaust system is\n_much_ louder than the stocker.\n\n4.  On older bikes,  exhaust back-pressure was the dominating factor.\nIf free-flowing air filters were substituted, very little difference\nwas noted, unless a free-flowing exhaust system was installed as well.\n\n5.  In general, an engine can be visualized as an air pump.  At any\ngiven RPM, anything that will cause the engine to pump more air, be it\non the intake or exhaust side, will cause it to produce more horsepower.\nPumping more air will require recalibration (rejetting) of the carburetor.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

I told a newbie friend of mine, who was having trouble from the complicated\nexplanations of his rider course, to think of using the handlebars to lean,\nnot to turn.

IF you can remember to tuck properly, the bits that are going to take most \npunishment with the gear you have will probably be your feet, then hips and \nknees. Get boots then  trousers. The gloves come last, as long as you've the \nself control to pull your arms in when you tuck.

Well, I'd say you're mostly right, but for different reasons. (BTW, as of a\ncouple years ago, the most stolen bikes in Orange County and SF were 750\nGSX's and Ninjas). Probably the biggest reason BMWs aren't ripped off is that\nmost people who buy BMWs will only deal with the actual BMW dealer, or mail-\norder types. Most of these can have their inventory checked fairly easily\nby law-enforcement types, and their mark-up is usually sufficient to keep \nthem honest about acquiring parts. \n\nFor Harleys and rice-rockets, you've got 2 different situations. There is a\nHUGE aftermarket in Harley parts, so a bike can be parted out fairly easily.\nDitto the non-sport Japanese bikes, but the prices on the parts for these are\nnot as high, comparatively. For the 'rockets', anytime a bike goes down, the \nplastic is usually cracked, and is expensive to replace. It's fairly easy,\nthen, for a disreputable shop to take a fairing from a stolen bike, slap it\non a bike in for repair, repaint it, and make a tidy profit. The other parts,\nmore traceable, can be used, or discarded if they are too traceable.\n\nMike

"Teflon" is a DuPont-owned tradename for PTFE.  Slick-50 does\nindeed use DuPont Teflon, though some other brands of such\nstuff may use imported PTFE of another brand.\n\n"Teflon", being a trade-name, should always by capitalized.\n\n(DuPont disclaims any benefits of PTFE in the oil supply of internal \ncombustion engines, BTW.)
Don't just nab it, POUNCE on it.  These are fairly rare bikes, and\nthey are MORE than adequate for putting a big brown stripe in your shorts.\nDoes a 50mph power wheelie appeal to you?  I thought it would...\n\n	Only really bad things:  the stock clutch isn't up to the task.\nBarnett can take care of this.  The back tire wears quickly (gee, wonder why?),\nand the induction system is a bear to work on.\n\nLater,
This is probably a stupid question but as I am new to the motorcycle scene\nI don't really know anything about it. What is DoD? \n\n					Thanks,
I think I've seen this bike.  Is it all white, with a sea-green stripe\nand just 'HONDA' for decals, I've seen such a bike numerous times over\nby Sewall hall at CU, and I thought it was a race-prepped CBR. \nI didn't see it over at the EC parking lot (I buzzed over there on my \nway home, all of 1/2 block off my route!)  but it was gone.\n\nIs a single sided swingarm available for the CBR?  I would imagine so, \nkinda neccisary for quick tire changes.  When I first saw it, I assumed it\nwas a bike repainted to cover crash damage.
And they're rather tasty.\n\n\n\n	Per gallon (bushel) perhaps. Unfortunately they eat the same amount\nevery day no matter how much you ride them. And if you don't fuel them they\ndie. On an annual basis, I spend much less on bike stuff than Amy the Wonder\nWife does on horse stuff. She has two horses, I've got umm, lesseee, 11 bikes.\nI ride constantly, she rides four or five times a week. Even if you count \ninsurance and the cost of the garage I built, I'm getting off cheaper than \nshe is. And having more fun (IMHO).\n\n\n\n-- \nGo fast. Take chances.
I have a cheap solar charger that I keep in my car.  I purchased it via\nsome mail order catalog when the 4 year old battery in my Oldsmobile would\nrun down during Summer when I was riding my bike more than driving my car.\nKnowing I'd be selling the car in a year or so, I purchased the charger.\nBelieve it or not, the thing worked.  The battery held a charge and\nenergetically started the car, many times after 4 or 5 weeks of just\nsitting.\n\nEventually I had to purchase a new battery anyway because the Winter sun\nwasn't strong enough due to its low angle.\n\nI think I paid $29 or $30 for the charger.  There are more powerful, more\nexpensive ones, but I purchased the cheapest one I could find.\n\nI've never used it on the bike because I have an E-Z Charger on it and\nkeep it plugged in all the time the bike is garaged.
I'd recommend that you hop on the back of it and cruise - that's a\nreally nice ride, if you choose your route with any care at all.\nShouldn't cost more than about $30 in gas, and maybe a night's motel\nbill...\n\n			       _MelloN_
I had knee surgery while I was in the Navy back in 77.  The \ndoctors put me in a cast from ass-to-ankle.  My only method of transportaion \nwas a DOHC 450 Honda at the time.  I found that by sliding back on the seat \nI could use my heel (did I mention it was my left leg?) to operate the shift.\nI would hook the end of the lever with my heel and lift my entire leg for up-\nshifts and just drop my leg on the lever for the down-shifts.  Forget \nnutral, took WAY too much finesse for the leg!  The crutches were bungee-\ncorded to the right side of the bike with the "top" resting on the passenger \npeg and the right turnsignal sticking through the "hole" in the crutches.  \nEvery other day when I rode the 10 miles to Physical Therapy (tourture \nsessions) the doc would give me hell about riding a bike much less riding in \nmy condition.  Didn't stop me tho! B-P\n\nBTW.  This is the same bike I assembled in my second floor barracks room and \nrode down the stairs when it was completed!
I'll tell you my story as an example of what *not* to do.\n\nEarly in 1984 I took some riding lessons from my college roommate on\nhis old Honda CB360T.  He had taken the MSF beginner's course, so I\nactually learned *some* of what I needed to know to ride.\n\nI proceeded to buy a beat-up Honda CL350 for $400 and a $12 helmet and\nrode around wearing this and a cotton windbreaker.  Then I decided to\ninvest in a full-face helmet (first smart move).  Sometime around then\nI also passed my road test.\n\nOn May 4, 1984, I got caught in a rainstorm on my way home from a\n4-mile trip.  Entering the town where I lived (a rather urban suburb),\nI had to stop suddenly for a red light that I noticed too late,\nskidded the rear tire out, and was ejected face upward into the\noncoming lane of traffic.  Fortunately for me the oncoming traffic was\nalso stopped for the same red light, otherwise I might have slid under\na car and been killed.\n\nNow this is anecdotal evidence, to be sure, but I later took the\nExperienced Rider Course from the MSF and saw that earlier training\ncould have helped me greatly.  In your case the need is even greater\nsince you have nobody to help you practice even the most basic stuff\nas I did.\n\nSo my advice is to take the MSF beginner's course first thing.  I\nwouldn't even buy a bike until you've taken the course, unless you\nhappen to pick up a real good deal and can store it someplace until\nyou're ready to use it.\n\n\nWhile you're waiting to take the course (it might take a few weeks in\nDC, as I recall there were always waiting lists in Boston), could you\nsave up some more money to start out right?  Say $300 for riding gear,\nplus the cost bike, plus maybe $100 (guess) to a mechanic to make sure\nthe machine is safe (assuming you economize by buying some old beat-up\nmachine from a private individual), plus insurance, plus registration\nand licensing fees, plus the course, you're looking at maybe $600 not\nincluding the bike itself and a reserve for ongoing maintenance.\n\n\nI pay about $100 insurance now (upstate NY) but it was closer to $200\nin Boston (more urban) for decent insurance including substantial\ncoverage for liability, which you want unless you plan always to be\npoor.  I'd guess DC is more like Boston than like a rural area, ergo\nmore expensive.\n\n\nThere used to be annual buyer's guides in the usual motorcycle\nmagazines; I found those helpful in getting an idea of what new or\nrecent models might be available.  You could probably look through\npast issues to size up what used bikes might be available.  (My first\nbike was 13 years old when I bought it so I went on my friend's advice\ninstead.)  Also look at the bikes that you see people riding or that\nare parked on the street.  I basically settled on my present bike by\nnoticing that there were a lot of high-mileage BMW's running around\nand they were generally set up the way I wanted.\n\nNothing wrong with talking to various dealers in your area or visiting\nshowrooms.  Dealers in the Boston area, at least when I was shopping,\nwere very nice about letting you look around their showrooms and\nquoting prices for bikes that weren't the latest models (hence\ncheaper), although I ended up buying both bikes in private sales.

According to BBC Radio this morning, UK, Denmark, Portugal & a few\nothers have vetoed a proposal to limit EC-sold bikes to 100 BHP.  The\nreason is that such a limit is not supported by accident statistics - a\nrare example of governmental wisdom.  The limit has a five year\nmoratorium on it, and "specialist" manufacturers will be exempt anyway. \nAny suspicion that this is a crafty trick to restrict that end of the\nmarket in Europe to Triumph, Norton (who? :-)), BMW, Cagiva & Ducati is\nthe sort of dangerous rubbish which stalls GATT talks.\n\nYou heard it here first.

When you're riding a cruiser, you "wave"\nby lifting two or three fingers of the left hand, without\nfirst removing that hand from the handlebar.  When you're\nriding a crotch rocket, you lower the left hand to about\nankle level, palm forward, and call that a wave.\n\nGeneric bike riders actually seem to raise the hand entirely\noff the handlebar and wave it around, so it's easy to tell\nwhen they're waving.
Yo, Whaz up!!!\n\nEarlier, I was reading on the net about using Splitfire plugs.  One\nguy was thinking about it and almost everybody shot him to hell.  Well,\nI saw one think that someone said about "Show me a team that used Split-\nfires...."  Well, here's some additional insight and some theories\nabout splitfire plugs and how they boost us as oppossed to cages.\n\nSplitfires were originally made to burn fuel more efficiently and\nincreased power for the 4x4 cages.  Well, for these guys, splitfires\nincreased performance by increasing TORQUE.  They weren't focusing\non horsepower numbers.\n\nNow how does this related to us high performance pilots?  Well, that\ndepends.  Do you pilot a high performance 2- or 4-cylinder machine?\nIn the case of 4-cylinders, splitfires would increase overall torque,\nbut 4's make more top end horsepower with its torque packed down low.\nSo for 4's, splitfires would not significantly increase power.\n\nBut what about twins?...  Many of you 4 guys laugh at some of us twins,\nbut many times we carry less weight which sometimes can make up for\nthe hp loss (see Doug Polen vs. Scott Russell, Daytona 1992).  However,\ntwins make more torque thoughout their powerbands.   So how does this\ntranslate?  Increased torque should "theoretically" help twins make\nmore power.  Splitfire claims that there should be not extra mods\nor anything made, just stick 'em in.\n\nNow I don't know about all of this (and I'm trying to catch up with\nsomebody about it now), but Splitfires should help twins more than\n4's.        \n\nAs far as racing teams....  Ducati team "Fast by Ferraci" used\nsplitfires in the 1989 season (this is when they had Jamie James\nrunning for em), but I don't know why they stopped since then.\nAlso, somebody check to see if they had them in 88.....\n\nPeace.\n\nWarren\nwcd82671@uxa.cso.uiuc.edu\n"Have Suzuki, will travel..."\n\nAt a local "fix-er-up-er" shop, the bike repairest looked at a\ndumped ZX-7.

Ummm...did you have any bikes other than that KX80? If not, I'd suggest you \nlook for an '89 ZX-7, since they only have about 90 horsepower, whereas the\n'90 has over 100 and might be a bit much for you...\n\nSincerely,\nNathaniel

being a mere female, I have often found I can't really take the big offensive line with asshole car drivers, so I found a more subtle and nastly\nooops I mean nasty way to get back at them. If somebody cuts you up, just wait till they have pulled out past you, and then gently lean over and\nbend their aerial, every time I have done that it has eventually snapped\noff near the base - which tends to go undetected for a while and is a bummer to replace.
On the other side of the fence, I owned a Bieffe off-road helmet.\nTook what I would consider a minor fall, and had visible damage\nto the shell.  Yes, the helmet did its job.  But the damage/impact\nratio was scary.  I own Bell Moto-5 now, have taken impacts on\norder of twice the Bieffe impact (we do this frequently in MX),\nand don't even have a scratch on it after two seasons.  My\nrecommendation is to buy _high_ quality gear.  YMMV.

That is as simple as asking the Keeper of the List\n(KotL, accept no substitue Keepers) for a number. If you're feeling\ncreative, and your favorite number hasn't been taken already, you can\nmake a request, subject to KotL approval. (Warning, non-numeric, non-\nbase-10 number requests are likely to earn a flame from the KotL. Not\nthat you won't get it, but you _will_ pay for it.)\n\nOh, and just one little, tiny suggestion. Ask the KotL in e-mail. You'll\njust be playing the lightning rod for flames if you post to the whole\nnet, and you'll look like a clueless newbie too.\n\nBy now you're probably asking "So who's the KotL already?". Well, as\nJohn Sloan notes below, that's about the only real "secret" left around\nhere, but a few (un)subtle hints can be divulged. First, it is not myself,\nnor anyone mentioned by name in this posting (maybe :-), though John was\nthe original KotL. Second, in keeping with the true spirit of Unix, the\nKotL's first name is only two letters long, and can be spelled entirely\nwith hexadecimal characters. (2.5, the KotL shares his name with a line-\noriented text utility.) Third, he has occasionally been seen posting\nmessages bestowing new DoD numbers (mostly to boneheads with "weenie\nmailers"). Fourth, there is reason to suspect the KotL of being a\nDead-Head.\n\n***************** Newsflash: A message from the KotL ******************\n\nOnce you have surmounted this intellectual pinnacle and electronically\ngroveled to the KotL, please keep in mind that the KotL does indeed\nwork for a living, and occasionally must pacify its boss by getting\nsomething done.  Your request may languish in mailer queue for (gasp!)\ndays, perhaps even (horrors!) a week or two.  During such times of\neconomic activity on the part of the KotL's employers, sending yet\nanother copy of your request will not speed processing of the queue (it\njust makes it longer, verification of this phenominon is left as an\nexcersize for the reader).  If you suspect mailer problems, at least\nannotate subsequent requests with an indication that a former request\nwas submitted, lest you be assigned multiple numbers (what, you think\nthe KotL *memorizes* the list?!?).\n\n***********************************************************************\n\nOne more thing, the KotL says that its telepathic powers aren't what\nthey used to be. So provide some information for the list, will ya?\nThe typical DoD List entry contains number, name, state/country, &\ne-mail address. For example:\n\n0111:Ed Green:CA:ed.green@East.Sun.COM\n\n(PS: While John mentions below that net access and a bike are the only\nrequirements for DoD membership, that's not strictly true these days, as\nthere are a number of Denizens who lack one or both.)\n\nBlaine (Dances With Bikers) Gardner   blgardne@javelin.sim.es.com\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n            "Denizens of Doom", by Bruce Tanner (DoD 0161)\n\n      [Road Rider, August 1991, reprinted with Bruce's permission]\n\nThere is a group of motorcyclists that gets together and does all the normal \nthings that a bunch of bikers do.  They discuss motorcycles and  \nmotorcycling, beverages, cleaning fluids, baklavah, balaclava, caltrops,  \nhelmets, anti-fog shields, spine protectors, aerodynamics, three-angle valve\nseats, bird hits, deer whistles, good restaurants, racing philosophy, \ntraffic laws, tickets, corrosion control, personalities, puns, double \nentendres, culture, absence of culture, first rides and friendship.  They \nargue with each other and plan rides together.\n\nThe difference between this group and your local motorcycle club is that, \nalthough they get together just about everyday, most have never seen each \nother face to face.  The members of this group live all over the known world \nand communicate with each other electronically via computer.\n\nThe computers range from laptops to multi-million dollar computer centers;  \nthe people range from college and university students to high-tech industry \nprofessionals to public-access electronic bulletin-board users.  Currently, \nrec.motorcycles (pronounced "wreck-dot-motorcycles," it's the file name for \nthe group's primary on-line "meeting place") carries about 2250 articles per \nmonth;  it is read by an estimated 29,000 people.  Most of the frequent \nposters belong to a motorcycle club, the Denizens of Doom, usually referred \nto as the DoD.\n\nThe DoD started when motorcyclist John R. Nickerson wrote a couple of \nparodies designed to poke fun at motorcycle stereotypes.  Fellow computer \nenthusiast Bruce Robinson posted these articles under the pen name, "Denizen \nof Doom."  A while later Chuck Rogers signed off as DoD nr. 0003 Keeper of \nthe Flame.  Bruce was then designated DoD nr. 0002, retroactively and, of \ncourse, Nickerson, the originator of the parodies, was given DoD nr. 0001.\n\nThe idea of a motorcycle club with no organization, no meetings and no rules \nappealed to many, so John Sloan -- DoD nr. 0011 -- became Keeper of the \nList, issuing DoD numbers to anyone who wanted one.  To date there have been \nalmost 400 memberships issued to people all over the United States and \nCanada, as well as Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, France, \nGermany, Norway and Finland.\n\nKeeper of the List Sloan eventually designed a club patch.  The initial run \nof 300 patches sold out immediately.  The profits from this went to the \nAmerican Motorcycle Heritage Foundation.  Another AMHF fund raiser -- \nselling Denizens of Doom pins to members -- was started by Arnie Skurow a \nfew months later.  Again, the project was successful and the profits were \ndonated to the foundation.  So far, the Denizens have contributed over $1500 \nto the AMA museum.  A plaque in the name of the Denizens of Doom now hangs \nin the Motorcycle Heritage Museum.\n\nAs often as possible, the DoD'ers crawl out from behind their CRTs and go \nriding together.  It turns out that the two largest concentrations of \nDoD'ers are centered near Denver/Boulder, Colorado, and in California's \n"Silicon Valley."  Consequently, two major events are the annual Assault on \nRollins Pass in Colorado, and the Northern versus Southern California \n"Joust."\n\nThe Ride-and-Feed is a bike trip over Rollins Pass, followed by a big \nbarbecue dinner.  The concept for the Joust is to have riders from Northern \nCalifornia ride south; riders from Southern California to ride north, \nmeeting at a predesignated site somewhere in the middle.  An additional plan \nfor 1991 is to hold an official Denizens of Doom homecoming in conjunction \nwith the AMA heritage homecoming in Columbus, Ohio, in July.\n\nThough it's a safe bet the the Denizens of Doom and their collective \ncommunications hub, rec.motorcycles, will not replace the more traditional \nmotorcycle organizations, for those who prowl the electronic pathways in \nsearch of two-wheeled camaraderie, it's a great way for kindred spirits to \nget together.  Long may they flame.\n\n\n"Live to Flame -- Flame to Live"	[centerbar]\n\nThis official motto of the Denizens of Doom refers to the ease with which \nyou can gratuitously insult someone electronically, when you would not do \nanything like that face to face.  These insults are known as "flames";  \nissuing them is called "flaming."  Flames often start when a member \ndisagrees with something another member has posted over the network.  A \ntypical, sophisticated, intelligent form of calm, reasoned rebuttal would be \nsomething like:  "What an incredibly stupid statement, you Spandex-clad \nposeur!"  This will guarantee that five other people will reply in defense \nof the original poster, describing just what they think of you, your riding \nability and your cat.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          _The Denizens of Doom: The Saga Unfolds_\n\n                  by John Sloan  DoD #0011\n\nPeriodically the question "What is DoD?" is raised. This is one of\nthose questions in the same class as "Why is the sky blue?", "If there\nis a God, why is there so much suffering in the world?" and "Why do\nwomen inevitably tell you that you're such a nice guy just before they\ndump you?", the kinds of questions steeped in mysticism, tradition,\nand philosophy, questions that have inspired research and discussion\nby philosophers in locker rooms, motorcycle service bays, and in the\nhalls of academe for generations. \n\nA long, long time ago (in computer time, where anything over a few\nminutes is an eternity and the halting problem really is a problem) on\na computer far, far away on the net (topologically speaking; two\nmachines in the same room in Atlanta might route mail to one another\nvia a system in Chicago), a chap who wished to remain anonymous (but\nwho was eventually assigned the DoD membership #1) wrote a satire of\nthe various personalities and flame wars of rec.motorcycles, and\nsigned it "The Denizen of Doom". Not wishing to identify himself, he\nasked that stalwart individual who would in the fullness of time\nbecome DoD #2 to post it for him. DoD #2, not really giving a whit\nabout what other people thought and generally being a right thinking\nindividual, did so.  Flaming and other amusements followed. \n\nHe who would become the holder of DoD membership #3 thought this was\nthe funniest thing he'd seen in a while (being the sort that is pretty\neasily amused), so he claimed membership in the Denizens of Doom\nMotorcycle Club, and started signing his postings with his membership\nnumber. \n\nPerhaps readers of rec.motorcycles were struck with the vision of a\nmotorcycle club with no dues, no rules, no restrictions as to brand or\nmake or model or national origin of motorcycle, a club organized\nelectronically.  It may well be that readers were yearning to become a\npart of something that would provide them with a greater identity, a\ngestalt personality, something in which the whole was greater than the\nsum of its parts.  It could also be that we're all computer nerds who\nwear black socks and sneakers and pocket protectors, who just happen\nto also love taking risks on machines with awesome power to weight\nratios, social outcasts who saw a clique that would finally be open\nminded enough to accept us as members. \n\nIn a clear case of self fulfilling prophesy, The Denizens of Doom\nMotorcycle Club was born. A club in which the majority of members have\nnever met one another face to face (and perhaps like it that way), yet\nfeel that they know one another pretty well (or well enough given some\nof the electronic personalities in the newsgroup). A club organized\nand run (in the loosest sense of the word) by volunteers through the\nnetwork via electronic news and mail, with a membership/mailing list\n(often used to organize group rides amongst members who live in the\nsame region), a motto, a logo, a series of photo albums circulating\naround the country (organized by DoD #9), club patches (organized by\n#11), and even an MTV-style music video (produced by #47 and\ndistributed on VHS by #18)! \n\nWhere will it end? Who knows? Will the DoD start sanctioning races,\nplacing limits on the memory and clock rate of the on-board engine\nmanagement computers? Will the DoD organize poker runs where each\nparticipant collects a hand of hardware and software reference cards?\nWill the DoD have a rally in which the attendees demand a terminal\nroom and at least a 386-sized UNIX system? Only time will tell. \n\nThe DoD has no dues, no rules, and no requirements other than net\naccess and a love for motorcycles. To become a member, one need only\nask (although we will admit that who you must ask is one of the few\nreally good club secrets). New members will receive via email a\nmembership number and the latest copy of the membership list, which\nincludes name, state, and email address. \n\nThe Denizens of Doom Motorcycle Club will live forever (or at least\nuntil next year when we may decided to change the name). \n\n                  Live to Flame - Flame to Live\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n     The DoD daemon as seen on the patches, pins, etc. by\n\n	Chuck Rogers,  car377@druhi.att.com,  DoD #0003\n \n\n                :-(           DoD            )-: \n               :-(  x    __         __    x   )-:      \n              :-(  x    / /         \ \    x   )-:     \n             :-(  x    / / -\-----/- \ \    x   )-:    \n            :-(  L     | \/  \   /  \/ |     F   )-:   \n            :-(  I     | /    \ /    \ |     L   )-:   \n            :-(  V     \/ __   /   __ \/     A   )-:   \n            :-(  E     / /  \     /  \ \     M   )-:   \n            :-(        | |   \   /   | |     E   )-:   \n            :-(  T     | | . | _ | . | |         )-:   \n            :-(  O     | \___// \\___/ |     T   )-:   \n            :-(         \     \_/     /      O   )-:   \n            :-(  F       \___     ___/           )-:   \n            :-(  L        \ \     / /        L   )-:   \n            :-(  A         \ vvvvv /         I   )-:   \n            :-(  M         | (   ) |         V   )-:   \n            :-(  E         | ^^^^^ |         E   )-:   \n             :-(  x        \_______/        x   )-:    \n              :-(  x                       x   )-:     \n               :-(  x   rec.motorcycles   x   )-:\n                :-(          USENET          )-:\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n                      The DoD\n\n              by the Denizen of Doom    DoD #1\n \nWelcome one and all to the flamingest, most wonderfullest newsgroup of\nall time: wreck.mudder-disciples or is it reak.mudder-disciples? The\nNames have been changes to protect the Guilty (riders) and Innocent\n(the bikes) alike. If you think you recognize a contorted version of\nyour name, you don't. It's just your guilt complex working against\nyou. Read 'em and weep. \n\nWe tune in on a conversation between some of our heros. Terrible\nBarbarian is extolling the virtues of his Hopalonga Puff-a-cane to\nReverend Muck Mudgers and Stompin Fueling-Injection: \n\nTerrible: This Hopalonga is the greatest... Beats BMWs dead!! \n\nMuck: I don't mean to preach, Terrible, but lighten up on the BMW\n     crowd eh?  I mean like I like riding my Yuka-yuka Fudgeo-Jammer\n     11 but what the heck.  \n\nStompin: No way, the BMW is it, complete, that's all man.\n\nTerrible: Nahhhh, you're sounding like Heritick Ratatnack! Hey, at\n     least he is selling his BMW and uses a Hopalonga Intercorruptor!\n     Not as good as a Puff-a-cane, should have been called a\n     Woosh-a-stream.\n\nStompin: You mean Wee-Stream.\n\nTerrible: Waddya going to do? Call in reinforcements???\n\nStompin: Yehh man. Here comes Arlow Scarecrow and High Tech. Let's see\n     what they say, eh? \n\nMuck: Now men, let's try to be civil about this.\n\nHigh Tech: Hi, I'm a 9 and the BMW is the greatest.\n\nArlow: Other than my B.T. I love my BMW!\n\nTerrible: B.T.???\n\nArlow: Burley Thumpison, the greatest all American ride you can own.\n\nMuck: Ahhh, look, you're making Terrible gag.\n\nTerrible: What does BMW stand for anyway??? \n\nMuck, Arlow, High: Beats Me, Wilhelm.\n\nTerrible: Actually, my name is Terrible. Hmmm, I don't know either.\n\nMuck: Say, here comes Chunky Bear.\n\nChunky: Hey, Hey, Hey! Smarter than your average bear!\n\nTerrible: Hey, didn't you drop your BMW???\n\nChunky: All right eh, a little BooBoo, but I left him behind. I mean \n     even Villy Ogle flamed me for that! \n\nMuck: It's okay, we all makes mistakes.\n\nOut of the blue the West coasters arrive, led by Tread Orange with\nDill Snorkssy, Heritick Ratatnack, Buck Garnish, Snob Rasseller and\nthe perenial favorite: Hooter Boobin Brush! \n\nHeritick: Heya Terrible, how's yer front to back bias?\n\nTerrible: Not bad, sold yer BMW?\n\nHeritick: Nahhh.\n\nHooter: Hoot, Hoot.\n\nBuck: Nice tree Hooter, how'd ya get up there?\n\nHooter: Carbujectors from Hell!!!\n\nMuck: What's a carbujector?\n\nHooter: Well, it ain't made of alumican!!! Made by Tilloslert!!\n\nMuck: Ahh, come on down, we aren't going to flame ya, honest!!\n\nDill: Well, where do we race?\n\nSnob: You know, Chunky, we know about about your drop and well, don't\n     ride! \n\nMuck: No! No! Quiet!\n\nTread: BMW's are the greatest in my supreme level headed opinion.\n     They even have luggage made by Sourkraut!\n\nHigh: My 9 too!\n\nTerrible, Heritick, Dill, Buck: Nahhhhh!!!\n\nStompin, Tread, High, Chunky, Snob: Yesss Yessssss!!!\n\nBefore this issue could be resolved the Hopalonga crew called up more\ncohorts from the local area including Polyanna Stirrup and the\ninfamous Booster Robiksen on his Cavortin! \n\nPolyanna: Well, men, the real bikers use stirrups on their bikes like\n     I use on my Hopalonga Evening-Bird Special. Helpful for getting\n     it up on the ole ventral stand!  \n\nTerrible: Hopalonga's are great like Polyanna says and Yuka-Yuka's and\n     Sumarikis and Kersnapis are good too! \n\nBooster: I hate Cavortin.\n\nAll: WE KNOW, WE KNOW.\n\nBooster: I love Cavortin.\n\nAll: WE KNOW WE KNOW.\n\nMuck: Well, what about Mucho Guzlers and Lepurras?\n\nSnob, Tread: Nawwwwww.\n\nMuck: What about a Tridump?\n\nTerrible: Isn't that a chewing gum?\n\nMuck: Auggggg, Waddda about a Pluck-a-kity?\n\nHeritick: Heyya Muck, you tryin' to call up the demon rider himself?\n\nMuck: No, no. There is more to Mudder-Disciples than arguing about make.\n\nTwo more riders zoom in, in the form of Pill Turret and Phalanx Lifter.\nPill: Out with dorsal stands and ventral stands forever.\n\nPhalanx: Hey, I don't know about that.\n\nAnd Now even more west coasters pour in.\nRoad O'Noblin: Hopalonga's are the greatest!\n\nMaulled Beerstein: May you sit on a bikejector!\n\nSuddenly more people arrived from the great dark nurth:\nKite Lanolin: Hey, BMW's are great, men.\n\nRobo-Nickie: I prefer motorcycle to robot transformers, personally.\n\nMore riders from the west coast come into the discussion:\nAviator Sourgas: Get a Burley-Thumpison with a belted-rigged frame.\n\nGuess Gasket: Go with a BMW or Burley-Thumpison.\n\nWith a roar and a screech the latest mudder-disciple thundered in. It\nwas none other that Clean Bikata on her Hopalonga CaBammerXorn. \nClean: Like look, Hopalonga are it but only CaBammerXorns. \n\nMuck: Why??\n\nClean: Well, like it's gotta be a 6-banger or nothin.\n\nMuck: But I only have a 4-banger.\n\nClean: No GOOD!\n\nChunky: Sob, some of us only have 2-bangers!\n\nClean: Inferior!\n\nStompin: Hey, look, here's proof BMW's are better. The Bimmer-Boys\nburst into song: (singing) Beemer Babe, Beemer Babe give me a\nthrill... \n\nRoad, Terrible, Polyanna, Maulled, Dill etc.: Wadddoes BMW stand for? \n\nHeritick, Stompin, Snob, Chunky, Tread, Kite, High, Arlow: BEAT'S ME,\n     WILHEM! \n\nRoad, Terrible, Polyanna, Maulled, Dill etc.: Oh, don't you mean BMW? \n\nAnd so the ensuing argument goes until the skies clouded over and the\nthunder roared and the Greatest Mudder-Disciple (G.M.D.) of them all\nboomed out.\nG.M.D.: Enough of your bickering! You are doomed to riding\n     Bigot & Suction powered mini-trikes for your childish actions. \n\nAll: no, No, NO!!! Puhlease.\n\nDoes this mean that all of the wreck.mudder-disciples will be riding\nmini-trikes?  Are our arguing heros doomed?  Tune in next week for the\nnext gut wretching episode of "The Yearning and Riderless" with its\never increasing cast of characters.  Where all technical problems will\nbe flamed over until well done.  Next week's episode will answer the\nquestion of: "To Helmet or Not to Helmet" will be aired, this is heady\nmaterial and viewer discretion is advised. \n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n          Script for the Denizens of Doom Anthem Video\n\n                by Jonathan E. Quist   DoD #94\n\n\n[Scene:  A sterile engineering office.  A lone figure, whom we'll call\nChuck, stands by a printer output bin, wearing a white CDC lab coat,\nwith 5 mechanical pencils in a pocket protector.] \n\n(editor's note: For some reason a great deal of amusement was had at\nthe First Annual DoD Uni-Coastal Ironhorse Ride & Joust by denizens\nreferring to each other as "Chuck". I guess you had to be there. I\nwasn't.) \n\nChuck:  I didn't want to be a Software Systems Analyst,\n cow-towing to the whims of a machine, and saying yessir, nosir,\n may-I-have-another-sir.  My mother made me do it.  I wanted\n to live a man's life,\n[Music slowly builds in background]\n riding Nortons and Triumphs through the highest mountain passes\n and the deepest valleys,\n living the life of a Motorcyclist;\n doing donuts and evading the police;\n terrorizing old ladies and raping small children;\n eating small dogs for tea (and large dogs for dinner).  In short,\n\n	I Want to be      A Denizen!\n\n[Chuck rips off his lab coat, revealing black leather jacket (with\nfringe), boots, and cap.  Scene simultaneously changes to the top of\nan obviously assaulted Rollins Pass.  A small throng of Hell's Angels\nsit on their Harleys in the near background, gunning their engines,\nshowering lookers-on with nails as they turn donuts, and leaking oil\non the tarmac.  Chuck is standing in front of a heavily chromed Fat\nBoy.] \n\nChuck [Sings to the tune of "The Lumberjack Song"]:\n\nI'm a Denizen and I'm okay,\nI flame all night and I ride all day.\n\n[Hell's Angels Echo Chorus, surprisingly heavy on tenors]:\nHe's a Denizen and he's okay,\nHe flames all night and he rides all day.\n\nI ride my bike;\nI eat my lunch;\nI go to the lavat'ry.\nOn Wednesdays I ride Skyline,\nRunning children down with glee.\n\n[Chorus]:\nHe rides his bike;\nHe eats his lunch;\nHe goes to the lavat'ry.\nOn Wednesdays he rides Skyline,\nRunning children down with glee.\n\n[Chorus refrain]:\n'Cause He's a Denizen...\n\nI ride real fast,\nMy name is Chuck,\nIt somehow seems to fit.\nI over-rate the worst bad f*ck,\nBut like a real good sh*t.\n\nOh, I'm a Denizen and I'm okay!\nI flame all night and I ride all day.\n\n[Chorus refrain]:\nOh, He's a Denizen...\n\nI wear high heels\nAnd bright pink shorts,\n full leathers and a bra.\nI wish I rode a Harley,\n just like my dear mama.\n\n[Chorus refrain]\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n                    Why you have to be killed.\n\nWell, the first thing you have to understand (just in case you managed\nto read this far, and still not figure it out) is that the DoD started\nas a joke. And in the words of one Denizen, it intends to remain one.\n\nSometime in the far distant past, a hapless newbie asked: "What does DoD\nstand for? It's not the Department of Defense is it?" Naturally, a\nDenizen who had watched the movie "Top Gun" a few times too many rose\nto the occasion and replied:\n\n"That's classified, we could tell you, but then we'd have to kill you."\n\nAnd the rest is history.\n\nA variation on the "security" theme is to supply disinformation about\nwhat DoD stands for. Notable contributions (and contributers, where\nknown) include:\n\nDaughters of Democracy (DoD 23)		Doers of Donuts\nDancers of Despair (DoD 9)		Debasers of Daughters\nDickweeds of Denver			Driveway of Death\nDebauchers of Donuts			Dumpers of Dirtbikes\n\nNote that this is not a comprehensive list, as variations appear to be\nlimited only by the contents of one's imagination or dictionary file.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n                     The rec.moto.photo archive\n\nFirst a bit of history, this all started with Ilana Stern and Chuck\nRogers organizing a rec.motorcycles photo album. Many copies were made,\nand several sets were sent on tours around the world, only to vanish in\nunknown locations. Then Bruce Tanner decided that it would be appropriate\nfor an electronic medium to have an electronic photo album. Bruce has not\nonly provided the disk space and ftp & e-mail access, but he has taken\nthe time to scan most of the photos that are available from the archive.\n\nNot only can you see what all these folks look like, you can also gawk\nat their motorcycles. A few non-photo files are available from the\nserver too, they include the DoD membership list, the DoD Yellow Pages,\nthe general rec.motorcycles FAQ, and this FAQ posting.\n\nHere are a couple of excerpts from from messages Bruce posted about how\nto use the archive.\n\n**********************************************************\n\nVia ftp:\n\ncerritos.edu [130.150.200.21]\n\nVia e-mail:\n\nThe address is server@cerritos.edu.  The commands are given in the body of the\nmessage.  The current commands are DIR and SEND, given one per line.  The\narguments to the commands are VMS style file specifications.  For\nrec.moto.photo the file spec is [DOD]file.  For example, you can send:\n\ndir [dod]\nsend [dod]bruce_tanner.gif\nsend [dod]dodframe.ps\n\nand you'll get back 5 mail messages; a directory listing, 3 uuencoded parts\nof bruce_tanner.gif, and the dodframe.ps file in ASCII.\n\nOh, wildcards (*) are allowed, but a maximum of 20 mail messages (rounded up to\nthe next whole file) are send.  A 'send [dod]*.gif' would send 150 files of\n50K each; not a good idea.\n-- \nBruce Tanner        (213) 860-2451 x 596    Tanner@Cerritos.EDU\nCerritos College    Norwalk, CA             cerritos!tanner\n\n**********************************************************\n\nA couple of comments: Bruce has put quite a bit of effort into this, so\nwhy not drop him a note if you find the rec.moto.photo archive useful?\nSecond, since Bruce has provided the server as a favor, it would be kind\nof you to access it after normal working hours (California time). \n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n                      Patches? What patches?\n\nYou may have heard mention of various DoD trinkets such as patches &\npins. And your reaction was probably: "I want!", or "That's sick!", or\nperhaps "That's sick! I want!"\n\nWell, there's some good news and some bad news. The good news is that\nthere's been an amazing variety of DoD-labeled widgets created. The bad\nnews is that there isn't anywhere you can buy any of them. This isn't\nbecause of any "exclusivity" attempt, but simply because there is no\n"DoD store" that keeps a stock. All of the creations have been done by\nindividual Denizens out of their own pockets. The typical procedure is\nsomeone says "I'm thinking of having a DoD frammitz made, they'll cost\n$xx.xx, with $xx.xx going to the AMA museum. Anyone want one?" Then\norders are taken, and a batch of frammitzes large enough to cover the\npre-paid orders is produced (and quickly consumed). So if you want a\nDoD doodad, act quickly the next time somebody decides to do one. Or\nproduce one yourself if you see a void that needs filling, after all\nthis is anarchy in action.\n\nHere's a possibly incomplete list of known DoD merchandise (and\nperpetrators). Patches (DoD#11), pins (DoD#99), stickers (DoD#99),\nmotorcycle license plate frames (DoD#216), t-shirts (DoD#99), polo shirts\n(DoD#122), Zippo lighters (DoD#99) [LtF FtL], belt buckles (DoD#99), and\npatches (DoD#99) [a second batch was done (and rapidly consumed) by\npopular demand].\n\nAll "profits" have been donated to the American Motorcyclist Association\nMotorcycle Heritage Museum. As of June 1992, over $5500 dollars has been\ncontributed to the museum fund by the DoD. If you visit the museum,\nyou'll see a large plaque on the Founders' Wall in the name of "Denizens\nof Doom, USENET, The World", complete with a DoD pin.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHere's a letter from the AMA to the DoD regarding our contributions.\n\n~Newsgroups: rec.motorcycles\n~From: Arnie Skurow <arnie@magnus.acs.ohio-state.edu>\n~Subject: A letter from the Motorcycle Heritage Museum\n~Date: Mon, 13 Apr 1992 11:04:58 GMT\n\nI received the following letter from Jim Rogers, director of the Museum,\nthe other day.\n\n"Dear Arnie and all members of the Denizens of Doom:\n\nCongratulations and expressions of gratitude are in order for you and the\nDenizens of Doom!  With your recent donation, the total amount donated is\nnow $5,500.  On behalf of the AMHF, please extend my heartfeld gratitude\nto all the membership of the Denizens.  The club's new plaque is presently\nbeing prepared.  Of course, everyone is invited to come to the museum to \nsee the plaque that will be installed in our Founders Foyer.  By the way,\nI will personally mount a Denizens club pin on the plaque.  Again, thank \nyou for all your support, which means so much to the foundation, the\nmuseum, and the fulfillment of its goals.\n\n                                Sincerely,\n\n\n                                Jim Rogers, D.O.D. #0395\n                                Director\n\nP.S.

Over $5500  [Arnie]\n \n                        Organized (?) Rides:\n\nSummer 1992 saw more organized rides, with the Joust in its third\nyear, and the Ride & Feed going strong, but without the Rollins Pass\ntrip due to the collapse of a tunnel.  The East Coast Denizens got\ntogether for the Right Coast Ride (RCR), with bikers from as far north\nas NH, and as far south as FL meeting in the Blueridge Mountains of\nNorth Carolina.  The Pacific Northwest crew organized  the first Great\nPacific Northwest Dryside Gather (GPNDG), another successful excuse for\nriding motorcycles, and seeing the faces behind the names we all have\ncome to know so well.  [Thanks to Ed Green for the above addition.]\n\nAlso worth mentioning are: The first rec.moto.dirt ride, held in the\nMoab/Canyonlands area of southern Utah. Riders from 5 states showed up,\nriding everything from monster BMWs to itty-bitty XRs to almost-legal\n2-strokes.  And though it's not an "official" (as if anything could be\nofficial with this crowd) rec.moto event, the vintage motorcycle races\nin Steamboat Springs, Colorado always provides a good excuse for netters\nto gather.  There's also been the occasional Labor Day gather in Utah.\nEuropean Denizens have staged some gathers too.

Interesting.  I'd fight the ticket.  First off, there's a 50/50 chance\nthe cop won't show up.  Secondly, if he does show up, you should point\nout that he lied (purgered) on the ticket.  Why 70+?  I beleive that if\nyo're charged with going more than 15mph that the posted speed it's a\nmore severe ticket.  You couldn't have p[ossibly been going 70+, right?!

Reading all you folks things to do to illegally parked cars made me\nwonder who's going to carry cinder blocks on a bike(?!?!?) or is \nready to do serious damage (key carvings etc.) to a cage.  Then I\nhad an idea--chain lube isn't just for chain's anymore!!!  It seems\nmore reasonable to me, no permanent damage but lots of work to get\noff!  (Don't ask me how I know :)  Use it anywhere, the windshield,\nthe door handles, in the keyhole, etc.  What a nasty mood I'm in.\nIt's raining again...
....\n\nSame thing to me.  Everyday the same dog would chase my bicycle.\nThe owners thought it was cute.  Even after I got the moto,\nthe stupid dog would do the same thing.  Then one day, I was\ncoming home in the opposite lane...the fluff with teeth ran to\nget me and played momentum sharing with a 73 Dodge pick.\nThe owners tried to blame me for driving down street when I did.\nI lived in a wierd town.
Hi, I just have a small question about my bike. \nBeing a fairly experienced BMW and MZ-Mechanic, I just don't know what to \nthink about my Honda. \nShe was using too much oil for the last 5000 km (on my trip to Daytona bike \nweek this spring), and all of a sudden, she trailed smoke like hell and \nwas running only on one cylinder. \nI towed the bike home and took it apart, but everything looks in perfect \nworking order. No cracks in the heads or pistons, the cylinder walls look \nvery clean, and the wear of pistons and cylinders is not measurable. All \nstill within factory specs. The only thing I could find, however, was a \nslightly bigger ring gap on the right cylinder (the one with the problem), \nbut it is still way below the wear-limit given in the Clymer-manual for \nthis bike. \nAny syggestions??? What else could cause my problem??? Do I have to hone \nthe cylinder walls (make them a little rougher in a criss-cross-pattern) in \norder to get better breaking in of my new rings??? Won't that increase the \nwear of my pistons??\nPlease send comments to \n	sruhl@mechanical.watstar.uwaterloo.ca\nThanks in advance. Stef.
But, think of the *mystique* you are buying into for that extra $7k or\nmore!!!

My previous posting on dog attacks must have generated some bad karma or\nsomething. I've weathered attempted dog attacks before using the\napproved method: Slow down to screw up dog's triangulation of target,\nthen take off and laugh at the dog, now far behind you. This time, it\ndidn't work because I didn't have time. Riding up the hill leading to my\nhouse, I encountered a liver-and-white Springer Spaniel (no relation to\nthe Springer Softail, or the Springer Spagthorpe, a close relation to\nthe Spagthorpe Viking). Actually, the dog encountered me with intent to\nharm.\n\nBut I digress: I was riding near the (unpainted) centerline of the\nroughly 30-foot wide road, doing between forty and sixty clicks (30 mph\nfor the velocity-impaired). The dog shot at me from behind bushes on the\nleft side of the road at an impossibly high speed. I later learned he\nhad been accelerating from the front porch, about thirty feet away,\nheading down the very gently sloped approach to the side of the road. I\nsaw the dog, and before you could say SIPDE, he was on me. Boom! I took\nthe dog in the left leg, and from the marks on the bike my leg was\ndriven up the side of the bike with considerable force, making permanent\nmarks on the plastic parts of the bike, and cracking one panel. I think\nI saw the dog spin around when I looked back, but my memory of this\nmoment is hazy.\n\nI next turned around, and picked the most likely looking house. The\napologetic woman explained that the dog was not seriously hurt (cut\nmouth) and hoped I was not hurt either. I could feel the pain in my\nshin, and expected a cool purple welt to form soon. Sadly, it has not.\nSo I'm left with a tender shin, and no cool battle scars!\n\nInterestingly, the one thing that never happened was that the bike never\nmoved off course. The not inconsiderable impact did not push the bike\noff course, nor did it cause me to put the bike out of control from some\ngut reaction to the sudden impact. Delayed pain may have helped me\nhere, as I didn't feel a sudden sharp pain that I can remember.\n\nWhat worries me about the accident is this: I don't think I could have\nprevented it except by traveling much slower than I was. This is not\nnecessarily an unreasonable suggestion for a residential area, but I was\nriding around the speed limit. I worry about what would have happened if\nit had been a car instead of a dog, but I console myself with the\nthought that it would take a truly insane BDI cager to whip out of a\nblind driveway at 15-30 mph. For that matter, how many driveways are\nlong enough for a car to hit 30 mph by the end?\n\nI eagerly await comment.\n\nRyan Cousinetc.|1982 Yamaha Vision XZ550 -Black Pig of Inverness|Live to Ride\nKotRB          |1958 AJS 500 C/S -King Rat                      |to Work to\nDoD# 0863      |I'd be a squid if I could afford the bike...    |Flame to\nryan.cousineau@compdyn.questor.org  |   Vancouver, BC, Canada   |Live . . .\n\n\n * SLMR 2.1a * "He's hurt."

It doesn't like them either.

Okay DoD'ers, here's a goddamn mystery for ya !\n\nToday I was turning a 90 degree corner just like on any other day, but there\nwas a slight difference-  a rough spot right in my path caused the suspension\nto compress in mid corner and some part of the bike hit the ground with a very\ntangible "thunk".  I pulled over at first opportunity to sus out the damage. \nMy bike is a Kawasaki GPX250R with footpegs that are hinged and sprung such\nthat they fold upward and backward on contact with ground etc., and on the\nlower extreme corner of each peg there is mounted a "bank-follower", or a\nlittle stud that theoretically is the first bit to hit the ground in a\n100%-banked turn.  The stud is mounted on the footpeg by a threaded bit about 7\nmm long, which screws into a threaded hole in the footpeg.  Now for the\nmystery.\n\nThe stud on the side of the bike that clunked when I turned was absent.  I'm\nfairly sure it was there before the event.  There was no damage to the end of\nthe footpeg where the stud would ordinarily have been.  In fact, the thread in\nthe hole in the footpeg was perfectly intact, with no evidence of something\nhaving been forcefully ripped out of it only moments previously.  \n\nOkay all you engineering types, how the f**k do you explain this ?  How can you\nrip a tightly fitting steel thread out of a threaded hole (in alloy) without\ndamaging the thread in the hole ?  Is this some sort of hi-tech design thingo\nthat Kawasaki never mentioned, like that the end of the footpeg suddenly\nchanges phase on impact, to let the stud rip out, then changes back to a solid\n?  I'm quite amazed at how this could have happened.  In the meantime, life\ngoes on, without a left-hand bank-follower.

If I have one thing to say about "No Fault" it would be\n"It isn't"
: I am in the market for a bike and have recently found a 1990\n: Honda VRF 750 at a dealership. The bike has about 47,000 miles\n: and is around $4500. It has had two previous owners, both employees\n: of the dealership who, I have been told, took very good care of the\n: bike.\n\n: I have two questions: 1) Is this too many miles for a bike? I know this\n: would not be many miles for a car but I am unfamiliar with the life\n: span of bikes. 2) Is this a decent price? I am also unfamilar with\n: prices for used bikes. Is there a blue book for bikes like there is\n: for cars?.\n\n: Thanks for any advice you can give.\n\n:                             --Mark\n--\n\nMark,\n\n  47k is not too many miles on a VFR750.  I sold my (well maintained)\n'87 VFR700 with 52k miles on it and the engine was in mint condition.\nAll that the bike needed was steering head bearings and fork bushings\nand seals.  The guy who bought it had a mechanic pull the valve covers\nto look at the top end, do a compression check etc.  He confirmed it was\nmint.\n\n   As for price, $4500 seems a little steep.  I bought my '90 with 12k\nmiles on it a year ago (and in absolutely cherry condition) for $4800.\nThere is a bluebook, ask your bank or credit union for the going price.\nI've seen a couple of ads for VFR's in the $4500 dollar range.  They all\nsaid low miles & mint condition but I didn't actually go look at them.\n\n   A VFR is a very sweet bike and will last you forever if you maintain\nit at all.  One thing to look for, BTW, is a soft front end.  If my\nVFR is any indication, at 12k miles the fork springs were totally shot.\nProgressive springs ($55) fixed it right up.\n\nGood luck,

Including all the ones who think that they countersteer all the way\nthrough a corner??\n\n\nAgreed!\n\n\nThis is really the only thing we disagree on. Maybe we should agree to\ndisagree?? I still think  that telling newbies to steer left to turn\nto the right is unnecessarily confusing, when they'll do it anyway if they\njust get on the bike and ride the damn thing.\n\n\n\n\nMe too!!\n\n:-)\n\n\n\n\nJeez, Ed, when you started talking about traction management policies I\nthought you were making some weird reference to looking after railway\nlocomotives...\n\nThe official line here (though I do have my doubts about it) is that the\nfront brake is applied first, followed by the rear brake, the idea being\nthat you avoid locking up the rear after weight transfer takes place. In\npractice I suspect most people do what you describe.\n\n\nIf you don't slide the tyre, you have no way of knowing whether you've\nachieved maximum braking or not. I'm not suggesting that you should always\naim to brake as hard as you possibly can - but if you want to find the\nlimits of the machine, you have to go beyond them.

We have made a lot of progress between\nrider education and responsibility over the last ten-twenty years...\nbut I am still amazed anytime I teach an ERC how many people of many\nyear riding experience "discover" countersteering for cornering or\nswerving.\n\nMike> everything else. Hard braking and swerving tend to be mutually exclusive\nMike> manouvres - did Hurt draw any conclusions on which one is generally\nMike> preferable?\n\nThe specific recommandation cited in the Hurt study was that a formal\n"street strategy", like SIPDE for example, was the most important\ncomponent of any rider education curriculum.  The specific skills of\nemergency braking, cornering and swerving must be taught and practiced\nas well, but more significant was that 35% of rider did NOTHING\nconfronted with a potential accident, and another third collided or\nfell over as a result of rider error.  The choice of specific maneuver\nis much less significant to the outcome than early detection and\nthe proper execution of ANY effective countermeasure.

What's the feeling about eating and riding?  I went out riding this\nweekend, and got a little carried away with some pecan pie.  The whole\nride back I felt sluggish.  I was certainly much more alert on the\nride in.  I'm sure others have the same feeling, but the strangest\nthing is that eating is usually the turnaround point of weekend rides.\n\nFrom now on, a little snack will do.  I'd much rather have a get that\nfull/sluggish feeling closer to home.\n\n-Paul
I remember seeing an artical on large-engine oil \nrequirements, and one of the ways of prolonging\nthe life of the oil was to run through a heated\nun-presurized chamber to allow water and volitiles\nto boil off.

I have a question about tires for my Guzzi. It is a '75 850-T. The tires that\nwere on it when I just bought it are old and cracked. I do not have an\nowners manual for it (yet), but the tires listed in the Haynes manual are:\nFront, 3,50 H 18 ; Rear 4.10 H 18, and pressures recommended are 26 front and\n33 rear. Oddly, the pressure for the same tire on the T-3 is listed at 29 psi\ninstead. Anyone know the reason? As I know though, the pressure I should run\nat is that recommended by the manufacturer of the new tires I purchase.\n\nThe real question I have is this. The old tires that are on the bike are for\nthe front, a Metzler Touring Special, 4.10 H 18, and for the rear an Avon\nRoadrunner 4.70 H 18, (120/90) H 18 as marked on each tire. Both are larger\nthan that listed in the Haynes Manual. What does the owners manual recommend,\nand was it common to go up one size for this bike? Also, this will be my first\nmotorcycle with innertubes. Any comments on the various manufacturers inner\ntube qualities?\n\nThe above sizes are inches (except for the additional mark on the current\nrear tire). What is the best metric match? The local BMW dealer thought\n100/90 H 18 on the front and 120/90 H 18 on the back. He also happens to be\nvery good at getting close to matching mail order prices.\n\nI am thinking of going with a Metzler ME33 Laser (possibly Comp K) on the\nfront and ME88 on the back, both in MBS variety if possible (the longer \nlasting belting system). I already use the ME33 on both the Vision and\nFJ for the front, and like it, and I thought that with the shaft drive\nbehavior and torque from the Guzzi that the ME88 might give more predictable\nback end control and sliding behavior than a ME55 might, as well as giving\nmuch better tire milage life. Any comments?\n\nA friend told me he thought that my bike had Boranni rims which are very\ngood, but are relatively soft and have delicate sidewalls. I do not wish to\nmount the tires myself this first time, so aside from warning the shop to be\ncareful, any other comments I should make? I havn't looked at the rim to\ncheck out the make yet, if it is marked. He just told me late yesterday and\nI havn't had a chance to check the rim type.\n\nOn another note. I will remove the ugly (but in good shape....anyone want it?)\nVetter fairing, and I will run without a windscreen for a while, but eventually\nI would like a simple rounded cafe' style quarter fairing for it. It could be\nfork/handlebar mounted. Any suggestions? Is there such a thing as a frame\nmounted quarter fairing of the cafe' style for this bike? How about lower\nbars/clip-ons for it? I would like to restore the bike into a good condition\nrunner with a few modern updates, but while not being historically exactly\naccurate still have it reflect relatively well a representation of the cafe'\nstyle. (Yes I know to be picky, that period really predates this bike....it is\njust that this bike has such potential for _that_ look.)\n\n-----------------------------Edward Walsh----Hewlett-Packard Company-------\n                             edw@boi.hp.com  Disk Memory Division, MS475\n                             (208)323-2174   P.O.

The best thing to do is to get a full face, even if it is a\ncheap brain bucket.  I didn't think a full face was important\nuntil I took a gnarly spill and ended up sliding 20 feet on my\nface.  Plus with the visor down, you also have no worries about\nyour contacts.
Sorry, I should have been more specific.  The 750 SS ran the quater in\n12.10 @ 108.17.  The last small V-twin Duc we got in the US (and the 400 is\na Pantah based V-twin) was the 500SL Pantah, and it ran a creditable 13.0 @\n103.  Modern carbs and what not should put the 400 in the high 12s at 105.\n\nBTW, FZR 400s ran mid 12s, and the latest crop of Japanese 400s will out\nrun that.  It's hard to remember, but but a new GOOF2 will clobber an old\nKZ1000 handily, both in top end and roll-on.  Technology stands still for\nno-one...
: I am in the market for a bike and have recently found a 1990\n: Honda VRF 750 at a dealership. The bike has about 47,000 miles\n: and is around $4500.

What's the problem here?  Back in 1958 I rode a Puch 175 from Paris to\nBarcelona and back.  That was a two stroke, and back then it was representative\nof the size of bikes on the road.  A 350 was considered a big bike, and the\nsuperbikes of the day were 500cc or 600cc.  Anything bigger was real rare.\n\n\nCharlie Smith,  DoD #0709,  doh #0000000004,  1KSPT=22.85
Never had any problem with mine...\n\nAre you *SURE* the nut/bolt you are trying is really a 1/2" hex?  13mm\nis just slightly larger...  and a 1/2 wrench won't fit on a GM 13mm\nnut (my 91 GMC pickup has several 13mm nuts on it...  really annoying, metric\nthreads too.

I ride my bike regularly to classes with my book bag.  I take\nthe shoulder straps on the bag, and hook them around the rear turn\nsignals.  I works fine.  You probably will want to attach it with\na bungee cord to keep it from shifting to one side or another.

Hmmmm.....I wondered where that hubcap went.
:  What is a general rule of thumb for sobriety and cycling? Couple hours after\n: you "feel" sober? What? Or should I just work with "If I drink tonight, I\n: don't ride until tomorrow"?\n\nIt depends on how badly you want to live.  The FAA says "eight hours, bottle\nto throttle" for pilots but recommends twenty-four hours.  The FARs specify\na blood/alcohol level of 0.4 as legally drunk, I think, which is more than\ntwice as strict as DWI minimums.\n\nBTW, alcohol metabolizes in your blood at a fixed rate -- one beer/hour will\nkeep your blood/alcohol level barely street-legal.  Coffee, hyperventilation\nand other bar tricks won't speed it up nor will they fool Mr. Ranger.
<...>	<...>\n\n	I've never liked my passengers to try and shift their weight with the\n	turns at all... I find the weight shift can be very sudden and\n	unnerving. It's one thing if they're just getting comfortable or\n	decide to look over your other shoulder, but I don't recommend having\n	him/her shift her weight with each turn... too violent.\n	\n	Also (I think someone already said this) make sure your passenger\n	wears good gear. I sometimes choose to ride without a helmet or\n	lacking other safety gear (depends on how squidly I feel) but I\n	won't let passengers do it. What I do to myself I can handle, but\n	I wouldn't want to hurt anyone else, so I don't let them on without\n	gloves, jacket, (at least) jeans, heavy boots, and a helmet that *fits*\n\n\n	Go *real* easy. It's amazing how solid a grip you have on the\n	handle bars that your passenger does not. Don't make her feel like\n	she's going to slide off the back, and "snappy" turns for you are\n	sickening lurches for her. In general, it feels much less controlled\n	and smooth as a passenger. I can't stand being on the back of my\n	brother's bike, and I ride aggressively when i ride and I know he's\n	a good pilot... still, everything feels very unsteady when you're\n	a passenger. \n\n\n\n	Show off by not showing off the first time out...
This thread brings back memorys of an expensive day in traffic court\na few years ago.  While I was waiting my turn to state my case and\nplea of why I was going 75 in a 55 in my cage, I had the opportunity\nto listen to some of the "creative excuses" offered the judge by others.\n\nAfter listening to a number of "Well, I was passing a very slow truck\nthat suddenly speed up" versions, I decided that the judge had heard\njust about every story in the book and then some.  He was less than\nimpressed with any of them.\n\nThis young, rather burley looking guy, had his docket read by a\nrather drill sargent looking Ohio State Highyway Patrol Trooper.\nHe was clocked riding a motorcycle at a speed of 110 mph in a 55 mph\nzone.  It was also noted that the defendant (motorcycle rider) had\nalcohol on his breath, but was not cited for this offence.\n\nThe judge looked over his half glasses purched on the end of his nose\nand said in his sternest voice: "Well son, those are some pretty\nfast speeds to be riding a motorcycle.  What do you have to say for\nyour self?"\n\n"Well Sir", meekly the defenant replied, "I just was over to my\nbuddys and we had a couple of beers and I was on my way home."\nHe offered nothing more or less.  Just had a couple of beers and\nwas doing 110 mph on his way home.\n\nThe judge moved by the simplicity of the response, fined him the\nmaximum in this case (plus court costs of course) and ordered him\nto attend remedial drivers training school.\n\nIsn't America Great??
Zero to very fast very quickly... lastest rumor is 115 hp at the rear wheel,\nhandles like a dream in a straight line to 80-100, and then gets a tad upset\naccording to a review in Cycle World... cornering, er well, you can't have \neverything... Seriously, handling is probably as good as the big standards\nof the early 80's but not compareable to whats state of the art these days.\n\nAll this gleemed from reviews and discussions with owners. I too lust after\nthis bike.
YESSS!  You make me proud to\nbe an 'Merkun.  Good thing you\ndidn't get shot though. Don't\ntry that with a good'ole boy in Texas.\nI once had a jeep driver south of Conroe cut me off (I was \nin my car) after I had flipped him off for doing something really idiotic\nand senseless.  All 280 lbs of him stretches out of his jeep; he walks\nback (he is blocking all traffic between Dallas and Houston since the\nfreeway has been squeezed into a single lane) and says to me, "Stick that\nfinger out again and I'll rip it off your hand and shove it down your\nsorry-ass throat."  I stared straight ahead, unblinking.  A hundred\ncars were honking.  Eventually he got back into his jeep, face beet-red\nwith anger, and all the rest of the way back to Houston I tailed him, \nwaving, honking, flipping him off, yelling...  I'm glad he decided \nnot to shoot me.\n/-----b-o-d-y---i-s---t-h-e---b-i-k-e----------------------------\\n\-----------------------s-o-u-l---i-s---t-h-e---r-i-d-e-r--------/
I dunno, on my old GS1000E the tank-seat junction was nice and smooth.\nBut if you were to travel all the way forward, you'd collect the top\ntriple-clamp in a sensitive area. I'd hate to have to make the choice,\nbut I think I'd prefer the FJ's gas tank. :-)
Or perhaps any planning at all.  :-)  Hiya Pete, still got that CBX?\nNice to hear from you again!\n\n\nOuch. :-)   This brings to mind one of the recommendations in the\nHurt Study.   Because the rear of the gas tank is in close proximity\nto highly prized and easily damaged anatomy, Hurt et al recommended\nthat manufacturers build the tank so as to reduce the, er, step function\nprovided when the rider's body slides off of the seat and onto the\ngas tank in the unfortunate event that the bike stops suddenly and the \nrider doesn't.  I think it's really inspiring how the manufacturers\nhave taken this advice to heart in their design of bikes like the \nCBR900RR and the GTS1000A.
Hi\n\nI t was very nice out yesterday in the 'burgh, so i rode my bike\nto my gynecologist appointment. When he came in to do the exam,\nhe noticed my helmet sitting on a chair.

My old jacket is about to bite the dust so I'm in the market for a new riding\njacket.  I'm looking for  recommendations for a suitable replacement.  I would\nlike to buy a full Aerostich suit but I can't afford $700 for it right now.\n\nI'm considering two basic options:\n\n1)  Buy the Aerostich jacket only.  Dunno how much it costs\n    due to recent price increases, but I'd imagine over $400.\n    That may be pushing my limit.  Advantages include the fact\n    that I can later add the pants, and that it nearly eliminates\n    the need for the jacket portion of a rainsuit.\n\n2)  Buy some kind of leather jacket.  I like a few of the new \n    Hein-Gericke FirstGear line, however they may be a bit pricey\n    unless I can work some sort of deal.  Advantages of leather\n    are potentially slightly better protection, enhanced pose\n    value (we all know how important that is :-), possibly cheaper\n    than upper Aerostich.\n\nRequirements for a jacket are that it must fit over a few other \nlayers (mainly a sizing thing), if leather i'd prefer a zip-out \nlining, it MUST have some body armor similar to aerostich (elbows, \nshoulders, forearms, possibly back/kidney protection, etc.), a \nreasonable amount of pocket space would be nice, ventilation would \nbe a plus, however it must be wearable in cold weather (below\nfreezing) with layers or perhaps electrics.\n\nPlease fire away with suggestions, comments, etc...\n\nSteve\n--

Well, you can accomplish both goals, actually, if you have a definite\nphysical type in mind when you go to these (cough) church meetings..  If\nyour tastes tend to smaller, more petite (cough) churchgoers, it is more\nlikely that they will have a smaller head, and you can safely get a medium\nor small helmet.\n\n  This works for me, and I traded my spare large helmet with my best friend,\nwho, at 6'9", tends to look more for women that are over 6'0", and can't\nusually fit into the medium size helmet he previously had...\n\n  Of course, if you aren't picky what size (*cough*) churchgoers you give\nhelpful motorcycle rides to, then Ed's advice will hopefully cover any\neventuality as far as legality is concerned, and a spare handtowel in the\ntankbag makes acceptable padding so the passenger can see out of the viewport\n(rather than the padding above the viewport) in the cases of extreme mismatch.\n\nRandy Davis                            Email: randy@megatek.com\nZX-11 #00072 Pilot                            {uunet!ucsd}!megatek!randy\nDoD #0013

I have a big backrest (approx 12" high) and\nwas hoping that I would be able to bungee cord the backpack to the backrest.\n\nAny one have any experiences on such experimentation?\n\nTaking the idea further, what would happen if the backpack was fully\nloaded with a full load (40lbs). Is the load distribution going to \nbe very severly affected? How will the bike perform with such a load \nclinging to the back rest.

IMHO = in my humble opinion!!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI didn't say there was no value - all I said was that it is very confusing\nto newbies. \n\n\nBill, you are kidding yourself here. Firstly, motorcycles do not steer\nthemselves - only the rider can do that. Secondly, it is the adhesion of the\ntyre on the road, the suspension geometry  and the ground clearance of the\n motorcycle which dictate how quickly you can swerve to avoid obstacles, and\nnot the knowledge of physics between the rider's ears. Are you seriously\nsuggesting that countersteering knowledge enables you to corner faster\nor more competentlY than you could manage otherwise??\n\n\n\nFormal training in this country (as far as I am aware) does not include\ncountersteering theory.  I found out about countersteering about six years ago,\nfrom a physics lecturer who was also a motorcyclist. I didn't believe him\nat first when he said I steered my bike to the right to make it turn left,\nbut I went out and analysed closely what I was doing, and realized he was \nright! It's an interesting bit of knowledge, and I've had a lot of fun since\nthen telling others about it, who were at first as sceptical as I was. But\nthat's all it is - an interesting bit of knowledge, and to claim that\nit is essential for all bikers to know it, or that you can corner faster\nor better as a result, is absurd.\n\nFormal training is in my view absolutely essential if you're going to\nbe able to ride a bike properly and safely. But by including countersteering\ntheory in newbie courses we are confusing people unnecessarily, right at\nthe time when there are *far* more important matters for them to learn.\nAnd that was my original point.

Not too hard to remember, I bought a GS1000 new in '78. :-) It was\n3rd place in the '78 speed wars (behind the CBX & XS Eleven) with a\n11.8 @ 113 1/4 mile, and 75 horses. That wouldn't even make a good 600\nthese days. Then again, I paid $2800 for it, so technology isn't the\nonly thing that's changed. Of course I'd still rather ride the old GS\nacross three states than any of the 600's.\n\nI guess it's an indication of how much things have changed that a 12\nsecond 400 didn't seem too far out of line.
When your helmetted nogin hits an immoveabe object, there are only four things\nto dissipate the energy: the immoveable object, the helmet shell, the helmet\nliner, the rider's head, the rider's ego (ok, five). Assuming that the helmet/\nhead assembly takes the same impact, if the shell cracks in one case, then in\nthe other the liner must be dented, or the head gets jiggled. If it's the\nthe liner that's dented, the helmet is just as toast as if the shell were\ncracked, it won't absorb energy form an impact in that area. If it's the head\nthat's getting jiggled, maybe the new gear isn't of as high quality after all?
Obviously never rode a good 250 or open-class bike!
}In heavy traffic I slow down a bit, mostly so I have more buffer zone in\n}front to balance the minimal buffer behind, but I also often find that the \n}jerk behind will notice traffic moving faster in other lanes, switch\n}into one of them, and pass me - which is fine, because then I can keep a\n}better eye on the jerk from behind, while looking ahead, rather than\n}from in front, while splitting my attention between ahead and the mirrors.\n\nThis is pretty damned complicated. I just make a "back off" motion with\nmy hand/arm, and the second or third time even the most braindead cager\nbacks off. If they don't back off then, I find a way to get the hell out\nof there -- the cager is either psychotic, drunk, or just a complete\nasshole. In any case, I don't want to be anywhere near, and especially\nnot in front.
Hello everyone.  I'm new to motorcycles so no flames please.  I don't\nhave my bike yet so I need a few pieces of information:\n\n1)  I only have about $1200-1300 to work with, so that would have \nto cover everything (bike, helmet, anything else that I'm too \nignorant to know I need to buy)\n\n2)  What is buying a bike going to do to my insurance?  I turn 18 in \nabout a month so my parents have been taking care of my insurance up\ntill now, and I need a comprehensive list of costs that buying a \nmotorcycle is going to insure (I live in Washington DC if that makes\na difference)\n\n3)  Any recommendations on what I should buy/where I should look for it?\n\n4)  In DC, as I imagine it is in every other state (OK, OK, we're not a \nstate - we're not bitter ;)), you take the written test first and then\nget a learners permit.  However, I'm wondering how one goes about \nlearning to ride the bike proficiently enough so as to a) get a liscence\nand b) not kill oneself.  I don't know anyone with a bike who could \nteach me, and the most advice I've heard is either "do you live near a\nfield" or "do you have a friend with a pickup truck", the answers to both\nof which are NO.  Do I just ride around my neighborhood and hope for \nthe best?  I kind of live in a residential area but it's not suburbs.\nIt's still the big city and I'm about a mile from downtown so that \ndoesn't seem too viable.  Any stories on how you all learned?\n\nThanks for any replies in advance.\n\n	-Greg Humphreys\n	:wq\n	^^^\n	Meant to do that.  (Damn autoindent)

Did you have anyone in particular in mind there Jody?
If he had a history of such things, why was it not mentioned in the\narticle, and why did they present the irrelevant detail of where he\ngot his drinking money from?\n\nI can't say exactly who is at fault here, but from where I sit is\nlooks like we're seeing the results either of the law going way out\nof hand or of shoddy journalism.\n\nIf the law wants to attach strings to how you spend a settlement, they\nshould put the money in trust.  They don't, so I would assume it's\nperfectly legitimate to drink it away, though I wouldn't spend it that\nway myself.
CB>        DON'T BE SO STUPID AS TO LEAVE YOUR HELMET ON THE SEAT WHERE IT CAN\nCB>        FALL DOWN AND GO BOOM!\n\nRyan> Another good place for your helmet is your mirror (!). I kid you not.\n\nThis is very bad advice.  Helmets have two major impact absorbing\nlayers... a hard outer shell and a closed-cell foam impact layer.\nMost helmets lose their protective properties because the inner liner\ncompacts over time, long before the outer shell is damaged or\ndelaminates from age.  Dr. Hurt tested helmets for many years\nfollowing his landmark study and has estimated that a helmet can lose\nup to 80% of it's effectiveness from inner liner compression.  I have\na video he produced that discusses this phenomenon in detail.\n\nPuncture compression of the type caused by mirrors, sissy bars, and\nother relatively sharp objects is the worst offender.  Even when the\ncomfort liner is unaffected, dents and holes in the foam can seriously\ndegrade the effectiveness of a helmet.  If you are in the habit of\n"parking your lid" on the mirrors, I suggest you look under the\ncomfort liner at the condition of the foam.  If it is significantly\ndamaged (or missing :-), replace the helmet.

hello there\nican anyone who has handson experience on riding the Yamaha v-max, pls kindly\ncomment on its handling .
I just mailed this:\n\nI noticed a 2-3in long cut in the tread of the rear tire on my VFR.\nThe cut is only about as deep as the tread block, and looks like it\nonly scratched the rubber at the base, but the weird thing is, it's\nway over on the edge where I haven't scuffed the tire in yet.\nMy questions are:\n1. How dangerous is this, should I replace the tire right away?\nand\n2. If I should, since the cut is on the unscuffed portion and the\ntire only has about 330 mi on it, what do you think my chances of\ngetting it replaced under warranty are?\n\nTo the nedod mailing list, and Jack Tavares suggested I check out\nhow old the tire is as one tactic for getting it replaced.  Does\nanyone have the file on how to read the date codes handy?\n\nThanks,\nDean

Hola amigos,\n\nQuiero... I need an answer to a pressing question.  I now own two\nbikes and would love to keep them both.  One is a capable and\nsmooth street bike, low and lightweight with wide power and great\nbrakes; the other is a Beemer G/S, kind of rough for the city but\ngreat on the long road and backroad.  A good start at a stable, but\nI don't think it's going to work.  Unfortunately, insurance is going\nto pluck me by the short hairs.  \n\nUnless... some insurance agent offers a multi-vehicle discount.  They\ndo this all the time for cars, assuming that you're only capable of \ndriving one of the things at a time.  I don't think I'll ever manage\nto straddle both bikes and ride them tandem down the street. (Turn left...\naccelerate the Zephyr; turn right... accelerate the Beemer.)  Does\nanybody know of an agency that makes use of this simple fact to\ndiscount your rates?  State Farm doesn't.\n\nBy the way, I'm moving to the Bay area so I'll be insuring the bikes\nthere, and registering them.  To ease me of the shock, can somebody\nguesstimate the cost of insuring a ZR550 and a R800GS?  Here in Tucson\nthey only cost me $320 (full) and $200 (liability only) for the two,\nper annum.
Here it's driving while impaired. That about covers everything.

It *may*\ned>be possible to improve your technique if you have no idea what it is,\ned>through trial and error, but it is not very effective methodology.\ned>Only by understanding the technique of steering a motorcycle can one\n                             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\ned>improve on that technique (I hold that this applies to any human\ned>endeavor).\n\nHerein lies the key to this thread:\n\nKindly note the difference in the responses.  Ed (and I) are talking\nabout knowing riding technique, while Mike is arguing knowing the physics\nbehind it.  It *is* possible to be taught the technique of countersteering\n(ie: push the bar on the inside of the turn to go that way) *without*\nhaving to learn all the fizziks about gyroscopes and ice cream cones\nand such as seen in the parallel thread.  That stuff is mainly of interest\nto techno-motorcycle geeks like the readers of rec.motorcycles  ;^),\nbut doesn't need to be taught to the average student learning c-steering.\nMike doesn't seem to be able to make the distinction.  I know people\nwho can carve circles around me who couldn't tell you who Newton was.\nOn the other hand, I know very intelligent, well-educated people who\nthink that you steer a motorcycle by either: 1) leaning, 2) steering\na la bicycles, or 3) a combination of 1 and 2.  Knowledge of physics\ndoesn't get you squat - knowledge of technique does!
Well, it looks like I'm F*cked for insurance.\n\nI had a DWI in 91 and for the beemer, as a rec.\nvehicle, it'll cost me almost $1200 bucks to insure/year.\n\nNow what do I do?\n\n(I could probably just sell the bike and return my DoD number,...\n)

Yes, yes, yes.  Motorcycling is slightly different to each and every one of us.  This\nis the nature of people, and one of the beauties of the sport.  \n\n\nAnd what view exactly is it that every single rider of cruiser bikes holds, a veiw\nthat, of course, no sport-bike rider could possibly hold?  Please quantify your\ngeneralization for us.  Careful, now, you're trying to pigeonhole a WHOLE bunch\nof people.
It depends on the bike. Once you've found a bike you're interested in, call\nsome insurance companies for rates. Some bikes are much cheaper to insure than\nyou might think (my EX-500 only costs me $127/year in St. Louis; I'm 27)\n\nFor a first bike, I recommend 500cc's or less. And a bike short enough to get\nboth feet on the ground when you stop.\n \nThe one piece of advice EVERYONE will give you is to take a Motorcycle Safety\nFoundation Rider's Course. See a dealer for details. In some states, completion\nof such a course can give you a break on insurance. It will also teach you\nto ride properly from the beginning, so you won't learn any bad habits.\n\nGood luck. Riding a motorcycle is the most fun you can have, naked or otherwise.
Don't you mean "former motorcyclist?"
Yes.  Unfortunately, there is also the concept that the owner of a car\nis not responsible for the actions of any (authorized) user of the car.\nThat's one of the biggest arguments against photo-radar ticketing\nsystems.\n\n\nTrouble with that is, you then have no recourse if a mis-issued ticket\nor a clerical error on a computer follow you around.  The City of Chicago\n(the informal motto of which being "The City the Works") issues dozens\nof parking tickets each year to people who have never set foot (or tire)\nin the city.

If your primary concern is protecting the passenger in the event of a\ncrash, have him or her fitted for a helmet that is their size.  If your\nprimary concern is complying with stupid helmet laws, carry a real big\nspare (you can put a big or small head in a big helmet, but not in a\nsmall one).

>Loud pipes are a biligerent exercise in ego projection,\n\nNo arguements following, just the facts.\n\nI was able to avoid an accident by revving my engine and having my\n*stock* Harley pipes make enough noise to draw someones attention.\n\nI instinctively revved my engine before I went for my horn.

So what's your local hospital's favorite curse?
What used to peeve me in Canada was the cars with bloody _red_ rear\nindicators.  You'd see a single red light come on and think, "Now, is he\nstopping but one brake-lamp is not working, or does he have those dumb bloody\n_red_ rear indicators?"  This being Survival 101, you have to assume he's\nbraking and take the appropriate actions, until such time as the light goes\nout and on again, after which you can be reasonably certain it's a bloody _red_\nrear indicator.
It is available through some dealerships, who in turn have to back\norder it from the manufacturer directly.  Each one is made to order, at least\nif you get a nonstandard length (standard is 5', I believe).\n\n\n	See below\n\n\n	I have a 6' long CobraLinks lock that I used to use for my Harley (she\ndoesn't get out much anymore, so I don't use the lock that often anymore).  It\nis made of 3/4" articulated steel shells covering seven strands of steel cable.\nIt is probably enough to stop all the joyriders, but, unfortunately,\nprofessionals can open it rather easily:\n\n	1) Freeze a link.\n\n	2) Break frozen link with your favorite method (hammers work well).\n\n	3) Snip through the steel cables (which, I have on authority, are\n		frightfully thin) with a set of boltcutters.\n\n	For the same money, you can get a Kryptonite cable lock, which is\nanywhere from 1/2" to 7/8" thick steel cable (looks like steel rope), shielded\nin a flexible covering to protect your bike's finish, and has a barrel-type\nlocking mechanism.  I don't know if it's adjustable, but my source says it's\nmore difficult to pick than most locks, and the cable tends to squish flat\nin bolt-cutter jaws rather than shear (5/8" model).\n\n	All bets are off if the thief has a die grinder with a cutoff wheel.\nEven the most durable locks tested yield to this tool in less than one minute.\n\n	FYI, I'll be getting a Krypto cable next paycheck.\n\nLater,
Not with a hub cap but one of those "Lumber yard delivery\ntrucks" made life interesting when he hit a 'dip' in the road\nand several sheets of sheetrock and a dozen 5 gallon cans of\nspackle came off at 70 mph.

A car in\nfront of me in the right lane hit her brakes, did a 360 and\nnailed a bridge abutment half way through the second 360.\n\nThe messiest time was in San Diego in 69' was on my way\nback to the apartment in ocean beach on my Sportster and\nhad just picked up a shake, burger n fries from jack in\nthe box and stuffed em in my foul weather jacket when the\nmilk shake opened up on Nimitz blvd at 50 mph, nothing\nlike the smell of vanilla milk shake cooking on the\nengine as it runs down your groin and legs and 15 people\nwaiting in back of you to make the same left turn you are.
That's absurd! That statement must therefore say that any argument in favor\nof seatbelts or airbags is an argument against automobiles.  Any argument\nfor lifeguards is an argument against swimming.  It says that any agrgument\nin favor of safety precautions is an argument for banning the activity to \nwhich the precautions apply.  Extrapolating to that degree is ridiculous,\nthere wouldn't be any normal human activity left to do; therefore it is\na non-seqitur.\n\nAlso, even though most people do not ride motorcycles, they do boat, sail,\njetski, climb, ski, fly parachute, hang-glide, glide, bungee-jump, bike,\nskate, rollerblade, skateboard, play rugby (ouch), mow the lawn, rewire\nthe basement, operate heavy machinery,  and do a host of other 'dangerous'\nthings that would all be as valid as motorcycling as activities to ban.\nYour little homily applies to all those things, and the general public\nbuying into banning motorcycles without realizing that their activity\nwould be next is unlikely.
: The next question is how shall I carry the thing on the bike, given\n: the metal frame and all. I have a big backrest (approx 12" high) and\n: was hoping that I would be able to bungee cord the backpack to the backrest.\n\n: Any one have any experiences on such experimentation?\n\nPut the pack on the pillion and bungee it to the backrest.\nIf that is not possible then you should be able to bungee it behind the\nbackrest, just make sure it doesn't bend or break anything like the rear\nfender or turnsignals.\n--
Well, it's been fun. This is my last day at Bellcore and\nIt will be a while before I have net access again (taking\ntime off and scheduling Military Schools for the summer\non joint operations, and anything else that looks good).\nI have had a blast reading, responding and commenting on\nthings posted here. My final say is 9mm's are inferior\nto .45's errr oh wrong news group. Hopefully I'll be back.\nI guess "internet withdrawl" starts around 1pm or so and\nconsidering I never knew inet existed 2 years ago I am\nreally going to miss it. \n\nOH yea, to the guy who called me this morning about the\n"Military issue" boots, good luck, I think you will be\nhappy with the tankers boots.
OK,\n\n    I saw a bike today and I want to know what it is.  Lets begin\nby saying that its whole rear end was definately Hawk 650.  Additionally,\nit had a CBR900RR style tank, full fairing, and only a tach.  Now, at\nfirst I thought it was an 'RC31' (a Hawk modified by Two Brothers Racing),\nbut I did not think that they made this huge tank for it.  Additionally,\nthe gauges were certainly not from a Hawk.  They looked much more like \n900RR gauges.  Overall, the bike looked like a 900RR except for the\nrear single-sided swingarm and wheel (there were straight from the Hawk)\n\nSo, what did I see?\n\n(PS, for any of you Boulder DoDers, I saw it parked at the Engineering\ncenter today. It is white with light green stripes.)

A word of warning, though:  Kryptonite also sells almost useless cable\nlocks under the Kryptonite name.\n\nWhen I obtained my second motorcycle, I migrated one of my Kryptonite \nU-locks from my bicycle to the new bike.  I then went out shopping for\na new lock for the bicycle.\n\nFor about the same money ($20) I had the choice of a Kryptonite cable lock\n(advantages: lock front and back wheels on bicycle and keep them both,\nKryptonite name) or a cheesy no-name U-lock (advantages: real steel).\nI chose the Kryptonite cable.  After less than a week, I took it back in\ndisgust and exchanged it for the cheesy no-name U-lock.\n\nFirst, the Krypto cable I bought is not made by Kryptonite, is not covered by\nthe Kryptonite guarantee, and doesn't even approach Kryptonite standards of\nquality and quality assurance.  It is just some generic made-in-Taiwan cable\nlock with the Kryptonite name on it.\n\nSecondly, the latch engagement mechanism is something of a joke.  I\ndon't know if mine was a particularly poor example, but it was often\nquite frustrating to get the latch to positively engage, and sometimes\nit would seem to engage, only to fall open when I went to unlock it.\n\nThirdly, the lock has a little plastic door on the keyway which serves\nthe sole purpose of frustrating any attempt to insert the key in the \ndark.  I didn't try it (obviously), but I have my doubts that the \nlock mechanism would stand up to an "insert screwdriver and TORQUE"\nattack.\n\nFourthly, the cable was not, in my opinion, of sufficient thickness to \ndeter theft (for my piece of crap bicycle, that is).  All cables suffer the\nweakness that they can be cut a few strands at a time.  If you are patient\nyou can cut cables with fingernail clippers.  Aviation snips would go \nthrough the cable in well under a minute.\n\n\n\n--

Greetings netters,\n\nSteve writes ... <about Cobra Locks>\n\nWell I have the mother of all locks. On Friday the 16th of April I took\npossesion of a 12' Cobra Links lock, 1" diameter. This was a special order.\n\nI weighs a lot. I had to carry it home and it was digging into my shoulder\nafter about two blocks.\n\nI have currently a Kryptonite Rock Lock through the front wheel, a HD\npadlock for the steering lock, a Master padlock to lock the cover to two\nfront spokes, and the Cobra Links through the rear swing arm and around a\npost in an underground parking garage.\n\nNext Friday the 30th I have an appointment to have an alarm installed on\nme bike.\n\nWhen I travel the Cobra Links and the cover and padlock stay at home.\n\nBy the way. I also removed the plastic mesh that is on the Cobra Links\nand encased the lock from end to end using bicycle inner tubes (two of\nthem) I got the from bicycle dealer that sold me the Cobra Links. The\nguys were really great and didn't mark up the price of the lock much\nand the inner tubes were free.\n\nLater.
Sigha.\n \n 1) Trying to figure out a way to put a halogen beam on my CB360T... Are \nthere any easy ways to do this (i.e. a "slip-in" bulb replacement)?\n \n 2) Was told by a guy at the bike shop that my "not damn near bright enough" \nincandescent beam might be caused by a perma-low battery. So I went and \npicked up this cheapo "Motorcycle battery and charging system tester"... \nHook it up to the battery, it's got 3 lights on "Very good charge"... Start \nthe engine (to test the charging system), and it doesn't even REGISTER. It's \nsupposed to light 5 or 6 lights if everything is OK, but it stays down at \nthe same point as just the battery.\n \n My question here is, if indeed my charging system is just plain messed up, \nhow the HECK is the battery staying fully charged? I'd think it would be \ndarned near dead from supporting my lights, etc...\n \n Do the '75 CB360T's have a problem with their charging system? Are they \njust generally slower charging than what is normal for bigger bikes?\n \n Is there an easy fix for this?\n \n 3) Happy noise: Put 300 miles on my bike this weekend, finally got myass an \nendorsement.... which is REALLY GOOD, because my cage just quit running \nworth a damn and I won't have money to repair it until the first... ;) And \nthe weatherman says "Bright and Sunny all week, 20% chance of rain on \nfriday"...

Request for opinions:	\n\n   Which is better - a one-piece Aerostitch or a two-piece Aerostitch?\n\n\n   We're looking for more than "Well, the 2-pc is more versatile, but the \n   1-pc is better protection,..."	\n\n   Thanks in advance,\n   Nadine\n\n\nWhat is best? Books have been written on that! But in regard to\nAeroStich it really depends on your particular size, shape and needs.\nIf you upper and lower body are not proportional (according to aero\ndimensions) then it probably is going to be better mixing and matching\nthe 2 piece suit. I have the 2 piece suit and I am very happy with it.\nHaving my life quota of scars from crashing off road, I am very\nconcerned with good protection and I believe that the difference in\nprotection between the 1 and 2 piece suits is almost negligible. I\nthink the optional hip pads and back protector make much more of a\ndifference. One thing that is nice about the 2 piece is if you go\nsomewhere and then want to walk around for a while (still with jacket)\nyou can just detach and stow the pants. \n\nOne thing to note is that Goldfine has problems getting a good fit for\nmany women (with standard suits). Supposedly for smaller women (and\npetite men for that matter) the 1 piece will fit better. \n\nAnother recommendation is to pay for mods if you need them. I wish I\ngot 2-3 inches added to my pant legs. I find the Long suits are not\nreally that long (I can't imagine how short the standard suits must\nbe).
Anyone, \n\n    I am a serious motorcycle enthusiast without a motorcycle, and to\nput it bluntly, it sucks.  I really would like some advice on what would\nbe a good starter bike for me.  I do know one thing however, I need to\nmake my first bike a good one, because buying a second any time soon is\nout of the question.  I am specifically interested in racing bikes, (CBR\n600 F2, GSX-R 750).  I know that this may sound kind of crazy\nconsidering that I've never had a bike before, but I am responsible, a\nfast learner, and in love.  Please give me any advice that you think\nwould help me in my search, including places to look or even specific\nbikes that you want to sell me.\n\n    Thanks  :-)

I'll second that!! I saw a list somewhere of all the stuff that it was \nunwise to buy secondhand - stuff like parachutes, toilet paper, condoms\nand motorcycle helmets...
Grf. Dropped my Shoei RF-200 off the seat of my bike while trying to rock \nit onto it's centerstand, chipped the heck out of the paint on it...\n \n So I cheerfully spent $.59 on a bottle of testor's model paint and \nrepainted the scratches and chips for 20 minutes.\n \n Then, while it was drying, I realized that I was out of smokes and that my \ncage is not currently running... So I "had to" take my bike down to the \nstore. Not wanting to mess up my paint job, I said "Well, heck. I can just \nuse my old helmet".... this is your standard el cheapie openface... \n  \n I didn't notice a big difference when I switched TO the shoei, but \nswitching back was really bad... \n \n 1) Doesn't fit worth a damn, too wide in the sides, too short front to \nback...\n 2) With a faceplate, it's still bloody windy... with the shoei, I normally \nignore the face shield until I get up to about 30ish... with this one, \ntaxiing to the end of the driveway was too smegging much wind.
There's an article in Motorcycling a couple of months back specifically on  \nwomen's attire for serious and not-so-serious riding.  They do mention who  \nmakes stuff specific for women's dimensions, and what also works OK enough as  \nwell.  Bates will make custom jackets and leathers for a reasonable charge.\n--

The word is "subrogation."  Seems to me, if you're willing to wait\nfor the money from scumbag's insurance, that you save having to pay the\ndeductible.

The ice princess next door makes a habit of flooring her cage out of the \ndriveway when she sees me coming. Probably only hits 25mph, or so. (I made \nthe mistake of waving to a neighbor. She has some sort of grudge, now.)\n\nI was riding downhill at ~60mph on a local backroad when a brown dobie came \nflashing through the brush at well over 30mph, on an intercept course with \nmy front wheel. The dog had started out at the top of the hill when it heard \nme and still had a lead when it hit the road. The dog was approaching from \nmy left, and was running full tilt to get to my bike on the other side of \nthe road before I went by. Rover was looking back at me to calculate the \nfinal trajectory. Too bad it didn't notice the car approaching at 50+mph \nfrom the other direction.\n\nI got a closeup view of the our poor canine friend's noggin careening off \nthe front bumper, smacking the asphalt, and getting runover by the front \ntire. It managed a pretty good yelp, just before impact. (peripheral \nimminent doom?) I guess the driver didn't see me or they probably would have \nswerved into my lane. The squeegeed pup actually got up and headed back \nhome, but I haven't seen it since. \n\nSniff. \n\nSometimes Fate sees you and smiles.

You're obviously not referring to any of the three above-quoted\nindividuals, because barnacles don't each send $20 to the crew of the\nship to keep it moving.\n\n"Get the organization to act on it" is easy to say, but says little\nabout what one really can and should do.  What the organization\nactually will do is largely determined by the president and directors,\nas far as I can see.  That's what makes it so important to vote in an\nelection of officers.\n\nIt does strike me that the BMWMOA is a lot less politically active (in\nthe state and national arenas, not infighting) than other M/C\norganizations.  Should we change this?  Or just join the other groups\nthat already are in politics?\n\n(Incidentally, the political hazards to motorcycle riders in the US at\nthe moment don't compare to the problems of some other groups like gun\nowners.

I can't think of another subject that generates as much contradictory\nadvice as traffic laws and their enforcement.  Everybody's got an\nopinion and is dead certain they are right.  Yet acurate information is\nextremely difficult to come by.  The DMV doesn't know.  Cops don't\nknow.  Your traffic school instructor doesn't know.  The vehicle code\nonly tells part of the story.  Judges choose to interpret the laws in a\nwide variety of ways.  And the public at large?  I seldom hear any\nadvice that doesn't disagree with something I've experienced.\n\nIf you don't believe me I suggest you get a copy of the vehicle code,\nstudy it, and then sit in on a day or two of court and see what really\nhappens.  Read "Fight Your Ticket" too, but don't miss the little\nsection at the end where it says your chances are lousy and you're\nbasically screwed.\n\nAs you may have guessed, I'm pretty down on the system here in\nCalifornia.  I've carefully prepared for court, bringing witnesses and\nrevealing serious holes in the officer's story, only to be slapped with\nthe maximum allowable fine (plus assessments of over 100%) - the\nmessage clear that the judge does not appreciate John Q Public trying\nhis own cases.\n\nSo here's my advice when you find yourself with a ticket:  Take traffic\nschool if you can.  If it's a serious matter get a lawyer.  A lawyer\ncan present the exact same case as you, the difference is the\nsentence.

I'm a biker and a dog-lover.\n\nFirst and foremost, I want to mention some common sense.  If it's a choice\nbetween injuring/killing a dog or getting yourself injured/killed, there is\nonly one rational decision.  Only the most insane animal rights kook would put\nthe dog first.\n\nSecond, it's useful to learn how to read a dog's body language.  How you react\nto a dog who is chasing you because he thinks it's a game (and that you're\nplaying with him) is completely different from how you react to a dog which\nhas hostile intent.\n\nThird, it's useful to learn how to present yourself to a dog.  Dogs are social\nbeasts, and recognize a domination/submission hierarchy.  To a dog, there are\ntwo types of fellow-creatures; that which he dominates, and that which\ndominate him.  You need to unambiguously represent yourself as being of the\nlatter class.  You are God: you are easily angered and your anger is terrible.\nBut God is also amused by one who properly submits to His dominance, and may\neven on rare occasions dispense a kind word, a kind word, or even (oh joy oh\nrapture unforeseen) A Dog Bisquit!\n\nNow, how does that all relate to biking?  Well, first, it's a good idea to\nassume that most dogs who chase motorcycles do so because they think it's a\ngame, and not out of overt hostility.  The MSF suggestion is a very good one;\nwhen you see the dog coming, slow down so he determines a particular place of\ninterception.  Just before you (and he) reach that spot, punch the throttle so\nthat when he reaches it you're already long gone.  Dogs take a few seconds to\nreact to new input, and definitely cannot comprehend the acceleration that a\nmotorcycle is capable of.\n\nWith a hostile dog, or one which you repeatedly encounter, stronger measures\nmay be necessary.  This is the face off.  First -- and there is very important\n-- make sure you NEVER face off a dog on his territory.  Face him off on the\nroad, not on his driveway.  If necessary, have a large stick, rolled up\nnewspaper, etc. (something the beast will understand is something that will\nhurt him).  Stand your ground, then slowly advance.  Your mental attitude is\nthat you are VERY ANGRY and are going to dispense TERRIBLE PUNISHMENT.  The\nlarger the dog, the greater your anger.\n\nDogs will pick up anger, just as they can pick up fear.  And, since you and he\nare not on his home territory, it may suddenly dawn on the dog that perhaps he\nis on your territory, and that you are prepared to fight to the death.\n\nMost dogs will decide that it is a good idea to retreat to their own territory\nwhere there is at least a home advantage.  They'll also observe that you are\nsatisfied by that retreat (gesture of submission) and thus they have escaped\npunishment.

Plus extras like hot showers, Tours, a Concourse\n D'Elegance and more.\n \n 	This is first time in the 49'er Rally's 20-year history that the \n event is being held in Quincy.  And according to Pat Gardner, Rally Chairman,\n "The 49'er Rally's continuing growth and the need for a larger and more\n complete facility led us to Quincy.  Plus we can get there on either of our\n two most favrite highways- Highway 70, which goes through the Feather River\n Canyon, or up from the South via the Northernmost part of the Gold Country's\n Highway 49."\n \n 	Day passes will not be available and non-BMW rider must be a \n pre-registered guest of a BMW rider.\n 	\n 	The Quincy Fairgrounds is located on California State Highway 70/89,\n two miles South of downtown Quincy.\n \n 	For pre-registration forms and additional information, write Doug\n Hubbard, BMW Club of Northern California, 41236 Norman Court, Fremont, CA\n 94539, or telephone <US> (510) 651-2195\n\n ADDITIONAL NOTES:: \n   This is a not for profit event and riders DO get their monies worth.\n   Whether you've ever attended a rally before or not This is the one\n   to make.  The only problem has been that there are so\n   many activities that attendees have to choose one over another.\n\n   Quincy is a beautiful campground, lots of grass and little dust.\n   For folks who have been to previous 49'er rallies at Mariposa, \n   Quincy has lots of space, all of it flat so room is not a problem.\n   There are buildings and such available if there is a change in the weather.\n   Also the people of Quincy are going all out to welcome us. \n   Registration will begin on thursday.  Of course there are always early\n   arrivals who will show up monday or tuesday.  The registration fee pays\n   for camping Thursday through Monday (5 days).  There will be a tour Friday\n   with the main events beginning Saturday.  Sunday Evening will be the\n   awards ceremony.

This is\n  a very good dirt bike and has been maintained perfectly.  I never had\n  any problems with it.\n\n  It's a four stroke, 4 valves, liquid cooled engine. It is heavier than \n  a 250 2 stroke but still lighter than a Honda XR600 and has a lot better \n  suspension (Ohlins shock, Husky fork) than the XR. For the casual or non\n  competitive rider, the engine is much better than any two stroke.\n  You can easily lug up hills and blast through trails with minimum gear\n  changes.\n  \n  The 1992 ignition and the carefully tuned carburation makes this bike\n  very easy to start (starts of first kick when cold or hot).  There is a\n  custom made carbon/kevlar (light 1 pound) wrap around skid plate to protect\n  the engine cases and the water pump.  The steering angle has been reduced \n  by 2 degree to increase steering quickness. This with the suspension tune-up\n  by Phil Douglas of Aftershock (Multiple time ISDE rider) gives it a better\n  ride than most bike: plush suspension, responsive steering with no head shake.
Bzzzt.  The 750SS is 40 pounds lighter than the 900SS.  I personally,\nand recently, witnessed my 750SS do a stoppie with a larger-than-\naverage rider aboard.  He said it took two fingers on that measely\nsingle front disk to accomplish the task.  How much more brake do\nyou need?\n\nI haven't gone over 4000 rpm yet (still in break in) and haven't\nhad a problem with the 750SS being too slow.  The limited steering\nlock can be a problem if you aren't prepared for it.  The mirrors\nare very good, IMHO.  Someone forgot to tell their designer about\nthe "whazza behind you, she no matta" philosophy.\n\nHmmmm.  I don't see a 400, 750 _or_ 900SS in your .sig.  Did I miss\nsomething?\n\nBeth

I was wondering if anybody knows anything about a Yamaha Seca Turbo.  I'm \nconsidering buying a used 1982 Seca Turbo for $1300 Canadian (~$1000 US)\nwith 30,000 km on the odo.  This will be my first bike.  Any comments?\n\nThanks.
I had a friend in Pittsburgh who had a CB1000C with the dual-range\ntranny on it.  He usually only used the "economy" range to get an overdrive\nsixth gear out of it.  He had 59000 miles on it when it was stolen.  It was\nrecovered shortly after that, repaired, and, for all I know, it's still going\nstrong.\n\n	The CB1000C was a shaft-driven overbore version of the CB900 and was\nmade for exactly one year (yep, head and base gaskets are VERY expensive).\nHelluva bike.\n\nA data point,

Insurance companies sure seem to go for No-Fault coverage.  Since the\nmajority of accidents are the cagers' fault, doesn't this imply that we\nwould have to pay much higher rates under a No-Fault system?\n\nWith a cars-only system, it seems to make sense on the surface: take the\nlegal costs out of the system.

OH yes they do! but considering i never wash my BMW (unless i need\nto work on it) i never get cuts untill the tools come out.....\naltho the best scar (now faded) was from the exhaust piper,\nwhile try to change the oil, after overheating the engine (watch\nout for idiot drivers that won't let you pass in the mountains\nwhen you have a rider, case of oil (it was on sale), and case of \nbeer), with a drain bolt that decided to seize.\n\njust how does everyone else clean out the area under the transmission\non a BMW R bike? they only way i have found is to remove the\nengine and transmission. that and the clutch arm are impossible to\nclean (which is wear one of the EC (s&m) are located).
1) The next time you get stoped by a cop, never never never admit to anything.\n\n2) Don't volunteer any information.\n\n3) When a retoracle question is ask by the cop, like "...it <looked> like you were going kinda fast coming down highway 12.  You <must have> been going at least 70 or 75?" -- the correct reponse is to deny it. This technique is employed by police to help establish guilt, especially when (9 times out of 10) he/she is not sure who was doing the speeding. If the cop is unsure this may be the difference of him letting you off the hook or getting the tissue.\n\nHope this helps for next time.

I don't think this is the case, at least not on all jetskis.  On my\nfriend's jetski, bars turn left to go left.  Anyway, all you're doing\nthere is changing the yaw of the jets, so the relationship between\nthe handlbars and the rear-mounted jets is completely arbitrary\n(simple linkage could make it work either way).\n\n\nIt seems to me that jetskis are even more irrelevant to this discussion\nthan snow skis.  But it *has* been an amusing digression.\n\nHey Ed, how do you explain the fact that you pull on a horse's reins\nleft to go left?  :-)  Or am I confusing two threads here?
I thought I posted this last year.\n\nThe women came to court with three witnesses; the two women that were in\nthe car and one neighbor that heard me shouting.  My lawyer didn't like\nthe odds since there were multiple complaints both ways and the judge had\na history of finding everyone guilty of at least something, so he convinced\nus (she came without a lawyer) to drop everything.  The net result was\na $500 laywer bill for me and $35 court costs for her.\n\nThe only consolation was that she had trouble scraping together the $35\nwhile $500 is not quite one week's beer money for me...

That's a twin-cam, right?  There's a steel guard right next to\nthe sprocket to keep a broken chain from punching a hole in the\nengine cases, and it's needed.  There's probably not enough room\nto fit a bigger sprocket.\n\nI'd be inclined to take two teeth off the rear for a 5% ratio\nchange rather than adding one to the front for about 7%.  If you\nraise the overall gear ratio too much you'll impair the bike's\nrideability, because the gears will be far enough apart that\nthere will be only one gear that provides adequate response at\nany given speed.  Honda 750s don't have the widest of power\nbands.\n--
: Also watch your mirrors any time you are turning. I just had another close\n: one last night. Preparing for a right turn on a two lane road. Right turn\n: signals on, starting the turn, and this lady behind me hits the throttle and\n: starts to pass me on the RIGHT.  This has happened to me twice before.  the\n\nI have had this happen to me often enough that I always look for it.\nOn my ride to work in the morning I come to a stop light where there are\n3 lanes in my direction.  One for left turns, one for straight through, and\none for right turns.  All clearly marked.  Plus there is a clearly marked \nbicycle lane.  I ride into the right turn lane with my signal on and stop at \nthe stop line.  Looking left to see if I can make a "right turn on red" and\nwhen I start to move discovered that some idiot has pulled into the bike\nlane and is trying to pass me on the right.  GRRR.\n   I always do a head check on bike lanes.  Not always for bicycles. . .
One of those "morning, just getting the coffee in me" thoughts:\n \n Waving at other bikers makes more sense than just "Hey, how's it going, \nnice to meet you on the road, have a good ride"\n \n 1) If you're watching for other bikes to wave to, it means your attention \nis on the road, where it should be, and you're more likely to see cages.
Yo, did anybody see this run of HARD COPY?\n\nI guy on a 600 Katana got pulled over by the Police (I guess for\nspeeding or something).  But just as the cop was about to step\nout of the car, the dude punches it down an interstate in Georgia.\nAng then, the cop gives chase.\n\nNow this was an interesting episode because it was all videotaped!!!\nEverything from the dramatic takeoff and 135mph chase to the sidestreet\nbattle at about 100mph.  What happened at the end?  The guy (who is\nbeing relentless chased down box the cage with the disco lights)\nslows a couple of times to taunt the cop.   After blowing a few stop\nsigns and making car jump to the side, he goes up a dead end street.\n\nThe Kat, although not the latest machine, is still a high performance\nmachine and he slams on the brakes.  Of couse, we all know that cages,\nespecially the ones with the disco lights, can't stop as fast as our\nhigh performance machines.  So what happens?...  The cage plows into the\nKat.\n\nLuckily for this dude, he was wearing a helmet and was not hurt.  But\ndude, how crazy can you get!?!  Yeah, we've all went out and played\ncat and mouse with our friends but, with a cop!!???!!!  How crazy can\nyou get!?!?!  It took just one look at a ZX-7 who tried this crap\nto convince me not to try any shit like that.  (Although the dude\ncollided with a car head on at 140 mph, the Kawasaki team colors\nstill looked good!!!  Just a few scratches, like no front end....\n3 inch long engine and other "minor" scratches...)\n\nIf you guys are out there, please, slow it down.  I not being\nan advocate for the cages (especially the ones that make that \nannoying ass noises...), but just think...  The next time you\npunched it (whether you have an all mighty ZX-11 or a "I can\ndo it" 250 Ninja), just remember, a kid could step out at any   \ntime.\n\nPeace & ride (kinda) safe.\n\nWarren -- "Have Suzuki, Will travel..."\nWCD82671@uxa.cso.uiuc.edu
Sixteen days I had put off test driving the Honda ST1100.  Finally,\nthe 17th was a Saturday without much rain.  In fact it cleared up, \nbecame warm and sunny, and the wind died.  About three weeks ago, I\ntook a long cool ride on the Hawk down to Cycles! 128 for a test ride.\nThey had sold, and delivered, the demo ST1100 about fifteen hours\nbefore I arrived.  And the demo VFR was bike-locked in the showroom --\nsurrounded by 150 other bikes, and not likely to move soon.\n\nToday was different.  There were even more bikes.  50 used dirt bikes,\n50 used street bikes, 35 cars, and a big tent full of Outlandishly Fat\nTouring Bikes With Trailers were all squeezed in the parking lot.\nSome sort of fat bike convention.  Shelly and Dave were running one\nMSF course each, at the same time.  One in the classroom and one on\nthe back lot.  Plus, there was the usuall free cookout food that\nCycles! gives away every weekend in the summer.  Hmmm, it seemed like\na big moto party.\n\nAfter about ten minutes of looking for Rob C, cheif of sales slime,\nand another 5 minutes reading and signing a long disclosure/libility/\npray-to-god form I helped JT push the ST out into the mess in the\nparking lot.  We went over the the controls, I put the tank bag from \nthe Hawk into the right saddlebag, and my wife put everything else\ninto the left saddlebag.  ( Thats nice.... )  Having helped push the \nST out to the lot, I thought it best to have JT move it to the edge of\nthe road, away from the 100+ bikes and 100+ people.  He rode it like a\nbicycle!  'It cant be that heavy' I thought.\n\nWell I was wrong.  As I sat on the ST, both feet down, all I could \nthink was "big".  Then I put one foot up.  "Heavy" came to mind very\nquickly.  With Cindy on the back -- was she on the back?  Hard to \ntell with seat three times as large as a Hawk seat -- the bike seemed\nnearly out of control just idling on the side of the road.\n\nBy 3000 rpm in second gear, all the weight seemed to dissappear.  Even\non bike with 4.1 miles on the odometer, slippery new tires, and pads that \ndid not yet bite the disks, things seems smooth and sure.  Cycles! is\non a section of 128 that few folks ever ride.  About 30 miles north\nof the computer concentration, about five miles north of where I95\nsplits away, 128 is a lighly travelled, two lane limited access\nhighway.  It goes through heavily forested sections of Hamilton, \nManchester-by-the-Sea and Newbury on its way to Gloucester.\nOn its way there, it meets 133, a road that winds from the sea about\n30 miles inland to Andover.  On its way it goes through many\nthoroughly New England spots.  Perfect, if slow, sport touring sections.\n\nCindy has no difficulty with speed.  3rd gear, 4th gear, purring along\nin top gear.  This thing has less low rpm grunt that my Hawk.  Lane \nchanges were a new experience.  A big heft is required to move this \nthing.  Responds well though.   No wallowing or complaint.  Behind the\nfairing it was fairly quiet, but the helmet buffeting was\nnon-trivial.  Top gear car passing at 85mph was nearly effortless.\nSmooth, smooth, smooth.   Not sure what the v4 sound reminds me of,\nbut it is pleasant.  If only the bars were not transmitting an endless\nbuzz.\n\nThe jump on to 133 caused me to be less than impressed with the\nbrakes.  Its a down hill, reversing camber, twice-reversing radius,\ndecreasing radius turn.  A real squeeze is needed on the front binder.  \nThe section of 133 we were on was tight, but too urban.  The ST works ok\nin this section, but it shows its weight.  We went by the clam shack\noft featured in "Spencer for Hire" -- a place where you could really \nfind "Spencer", his house was about 15 miles down 133.  After putting\nthrough traffic for a while, we turned and went back to 128.\n\nAbout half way through the onramp, I yanked Cindy's wrist, our singal\nfor "hold on tight".  Head check left,  time to find redline.  Second\ngear gives a good shove.  Third too.  Fourth sees DoD speed with a \nshort shift into top.  On the way to 133 we saw no cops and very light\ntraffic.  Did not cross into DoD zone because the bike was too new.\nWell, now it had 25 miles on it, so it was ok.  Tried some high effort\nlane changes, some wide sweeping turns.  Time to wick it up?  I went \nuntil the buffeting was threating to pull us off the seat.  And stayed\nthere.  When I was comfortable with the wind and the steering, \nI looked down to find an indicated 135mph.  Not bad for 2-up touring.\n\nBeverly comes fast at more than twice the posted limit.  At the "get\noff in a mile" sign, I rolled off the throttle and coasted.  I wanted\nto re-adjust to the coming slowness.  It was a good idea:  there were\nseveral manhole-sized patches of sand on the exit ramp.  Back to the \nslow and heavy behavior.  Cycles! is about a mile from 128.  I could \nsee even more cars stacked up outside right when I got off.  I managed\nto thread the ST through the cars to the edge of the concrete pad\nout front.  Heavy.  It took way too much effort for Cindy and I to put\nthe thing on the center stand.  I am sure that if I used the side\nstand the ST would have been on its side within a minute.\n\n\nMy demo opinion?  Heavy.  Put it on a diet.  Smooth, comfortable,\nhardly notices the DoD speed.   I'd buy on for about $3000 less than \nlist, just like it is.  Too much $ for the bike as it is.
Maybe...then again did you get rid of that H/D of yorn and buy a rice rocket \nof your own?  That would certainly explain the friendliness...unless you \nmaybe had a piece of toilet paper stuck on the bottom of your boot...8-).\n\nRich
