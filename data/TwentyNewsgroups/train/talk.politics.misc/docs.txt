SECRET PURPOSE OF FALKLANDS WAR;  [with IN-VISIBILITY Technology]\n\nDr. Beter AUDIO LETTER #74 of 80\n\nDigitized by Jon Volkoff, mail address eidetics@cerf.net\n\n"AUDIO LETTER(R)" is a registered trademark of Audio Books,\nInc., a Texas corporation, which originally produced this tape\nrecording.

Today is April 30,\n1982, and this is my AUDIO LETTER(R) No. 74.\n\n  It's now been almost one month since war broke out in the South\nAtlantic.  On the surface it seems that it's only a dispute\nbetween Argentina and Great Britain over the barren, wind-swept\nFalkland Islands and South Georgia Island.  In reality, it's far\nmore than that.\n\n   The so-called Falklands crisis is just the visible tip of a\ngiant military operation.  During this month of April 1982,\nfierce naval battles have taken place--not only in the South\nAtlantic but also in the South Pacific.  Up to now most of the\nhostilities have been kept under wraps by wartime censorship on\nall sides.  But as I say these words, the naval war in the\nSouthern Hemisphere is about to come to the surface.\n\n   Beginning today, April 30, a total naval and air blockade of\nthe Falklands by the Royal Navy has begun.  At the same time a\ncounterblockade has been declared by Argentina in the same area.\n\n   To be effective, a blockade must be imposed over a period of\ntime, but the Royal Navy does not have that much time.  Winter is\ncoming on in the South Atlantic, and the British supply lines are\noverextended.  Having come this far, Her Majesty's navy cannot\nsimply drop the blockade and sail away in a few weeks time\nwithout drawing blood from Argentina.  As a result the British\nwill be forced to undertake military operations very soon no\nmatter how risky they may be.\n\n   There is also another reason why the Royal Navy now has no\nchoice but to engage the Argentine forces in combat.  That\nreason, my friends, is that the Royal Navy has already suffered\nlosses in secret combat this month.  Up to this moment there will\nbe no way to explain away the damage which has been sustained by\nthe British fleet.  Only when publicly admitted fighting erupts\nwill the British dare to admit that they have suffered battle\nlosses.  To obtain that cover story, the British have no choice\nbut to sail into combat; but in doing so, they will be risking\neven heavier losses on top of those already sustained.  In short,\nmy friends, Her Majesty's navy has sailed into a trap.\n\n   The events now unfolding in the South Atlantic carry strange,\nironic echoes of the past.  For weeks now we've been hearing\ncountless commentators referring to the British task force as an\n"armada" (quote).  The British of all people ought to be very\nuneasy with that description.  The original Spanish Armada 400\nyears ago was renowned as a seemingly invincible fighting force,\nbut it came to grief in a naval disaster so complete that it\nchanged the course of history--and it was none other than the\nEnglish navy that destroyed the Spanish Armada.\n\n   The original Spanish Armada put to sea in 1588 during the\nreign of England's Queen Elizabeth I.  The Armada was an invasion\nfleet carrying thousands of crack fighting men to invade England. \nThey were met by the daring sea dogs of Sir Francis Drake.  Drake\nand his small, fast ships turned the tables on the Spanish Armada\nby changing the rules of battle.  The English fleet was equipped\nwith new longer-range guns, and it stayed upwind and out of\nreach.  From there the English pounded, smashed, and shattered\nthe big ships of the mighty Armada.  When it was all over, barely\nhalf the Spanish fleet was left to limp back to port.  Drake's\ndefeat of the Spanish Armada was a shock to the world.  It opened\nthe door for England under Queen Elizabeth I to start its\nexpansion into a truly global empire.\n\n   Today, 400 years later, history seems to have come full\ncircle.  Queen Elizabeth II is witnessing the dismantling of the\nworld empire whose heyday began under Queen Elizabeth I, and now\nthe cultures of England and of Spain are once again in\nconfrontation.  Once again a so-called armada is preparing for\ninvasion, but this time the armada is British, not Spanish.  Four\nhundred years ago Sir Francis Drake was the hero of the day;\ntoday, the ghost of Francis Drake is once again on the scene.\n\n   The South Atlantic war zone is at the eastern end of the Drake\nPassage around the southern tip of South America.  The defeat of\nthe Spanish Armada four centuries ago broke the back of Spain's\nnaval supremacy, and now the defeat of the new British armada may\nwell break the back of what remains of the once glorious Royal\nNavy.\n\n   My three special topics for this AUDIO LETTER are:\n\nTopic #1--THE MILITARY SECRET OF SOUTH GEORGIA ISLAND\nTopic #2--THE SECRET NAVAL WAR OF THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE\nTopic #3--THE ROCKEFELLER FEAR CAMPAIGN AGAINST NUCLEAR WAR.\n\nTopic #1--When the Falkland Islands crisis began early this month\nit looked at first like a tempest in a teapot.  For a century and\na half since 1833, the Islands have been controlled by Great\nBritain.  During that entire time, British sovereignty over the\nFalklands has been disputed by Argentina.  There have been\ncountless threats by Argentina to seize the Islands, which it\ncalls the Malvinas, but the threats have always come to nothing\nin the past and Britain has never even gotten very worried about\nthem.\n\n   The Islands are four times as distant from Argentina as Cuba\nis from the United States, and they are not much of a prize. \nAfter 150 years of occupancy, the Falklands are home to fewer\nthan 2,000 British settlers and a lot of sheep.  In short, the\nremote Falkland Islands hardly look like something to fight over,\nand yet here we are watching another crisis take place.  We are\nwatching as war erupts between Great Britain and Argentina.\n\n   The Thatcher government is acting as if it has forgotten all\nabout its usual preoccupation with the Soviet threat at NATO's\ndoorstep.  Instead, Britain is throwing almost everything it's\ngot at Argentina---aircraft carriers, cruisers, destroyers,\nsubmarines, assault ships--you name it.  Luxury cruise ships have\neven been commissioned and turned into troop carriers overnight. \nWave after wave of additional assault troops have been activated\nand sent to join the fleet even after it sailed.  Ships and\nsubmarines have been pulled off station from normal NATO duty and\nsent to reinforce the task force.  The initial 40-ship force has\ngrown steadily over the past several weeks into an armada\nnumbering over 70.  Over two-thirds of the entire Royal Navy has\nalready been deployed to the South Atlantic off Argentina.\n\n   Watching all this, a lot of people are asking: What's this\nfight really all about?  The most popular answer suggested in the\nmajor media is "oil."  Vast deposits of oil are known to exist\nunder the continental shelf between Argentina and the Falklands,\nbut that has been known for nearly 10 years.  In no way does it\nexplain the timing of the sudden military offensive by Argentina\nthis month, and oil explains even less about the Argentine\nseizure of South Georgia Island.\n\n   South Georgia Island is 800 miles east of the Falklands with\nno known oil deposits anywhere near it; and compared to South\nGeorgia, the Falklands are an island paradise.  South Georgia\nIsland is covered with rugged mountains, treacherous valleys,\nglaciers, and semi-permanent snow.  Most of it is uninhabitable. \nOn top of all that, Argentina has absolutely no legal or\nhistorical claim to South Georgia Island.  In that respect it\nstands in sharp contrast to the Falklands.\n\n   In the early 1830s the Falklands were occupied for a while by\nArgentine colonists.  In 1833 the British expelled them and took\nover the Island.  For that and other historical reasons,\nArgentina argues that the Falklands really belong to Argentina,\nnot Britain.\n\n   But no such argument is possible for South Georgia Island.  It\nhas always been controlled by Britain, never by Argentina or\nSpain.  The Argentine seizure of South Georgia Island looks even\nmore unreasonable from a military point of view.  Argentina's\nleaders are military men and they think in military terms.  They\nwere well aware ahead of time that far-off South Georgia Island\ncould not possibly be held for long.  By seizing it they were\nsetting themselves up to absorb a military defeat, as the Island\nwas retaken by Britain.  So the question is: Why did Argentina's\nmilitary junta bother with the seemingly worthless South Georgia\nIsland at all?\n\n   My friends, the answers to all these questions are military,\nnot political or economic.  South Georgia Island possesses an\nenormous military secret.  It's a giant underground installation\nburied under the mountains at the northwest end of the Island. \nThe real reason for the so-called Falkland crisis is this secret\ninstallation, together with two other similar installations which\nI will describe shortly.\n\n   The secret military complexes have been in existence for many\nyears; they are not new.  What is new is the accelerated nuclear\nwar timetable of the American Bolshevik war planners here in\nWashington.  For the past two months I've been reporting the\ndetails of this new war plan to you as quickly as I can obtain\nand verify them.\n\n   The plan calls for NUCLEAR WAR ONE to erupt by September of\nthis year 1982!!  It is this fast-approaching nuclear war threat\nthat caused the so-called Falklands crisis to erupt now.\n\n   What is going on now is a coordinated effort to spoil part of\nthe Bolshevik grand strategy for the coming nuclear war.  The\nmutual enemies of the American Bolsheviks here--namely, the\nRockefeller cartel--and Russia's new rulers in the Kremlin are\nbehind the present crisis.  They are trying to ruin Phase #3 of\nthe "PROJECT Z" war plan which I revealed last month.  That phase\nis to be world domination by the American Bolsheviks after both\nRussia and the United States have been destroyed in NUCLEAR WAR\nONE.  As I mentioned last month, the key to this plan is the\nexistence of secret weapons stockpiles in various places around\nthe world.\n\n   The American Bolshevik military planners here in America are\nworking with other Bolshevik agents in key military positions of\nother countries to set off war.  Having done that, they intend to\nride out the nuclear holocaust they have caused, safe and cozy in\nGovernment war bunkers!  When the warring nations finally lie\nsmoldering and exhausted, the Bolsheviks will leave the shattered\nremains of their host countries.  They will rendezvous at the\nsecret weapons installations and bring their weapons into the\nopen.  They will confront the world with the only remaining\nfresh, up-to-date, powerful military force on earth; and using\nthat military power, they will become the undisputed rulers of\nthe world--that is, they plan to do all this, and they plan to\npave the way for world domination very soon by setting off\nNUCLEAR WAR ONE in a matter of months.  The Rockefeller cartel\nand Russia's new anti-Bolshevik rulers are working together in a\nrace against time to try to head off the Bolshevik war plan.\n\n   Last month I mentioned that the Bolsheviks here are\nbenefitting from war preparations which were started by the\nRockefellers long ago.  It has only been about three years since\nthe Rockefellers were dislodged as the prime movers of the United\nStates Government by the Bolsheviks.  Since that time the United\nStates Government has been a house divided, torn by internal\npower struggles between rival Bolshevik and Rockefeller factions. \nBut before that, the United States had been dominated for decades\nboth economically and politically by the Four Rockefeller\nBrothers.\n\n   In 1961 the Brothers launched a new long-range plan for world\ndomination.  It was a two-prong strategy, half visible and half\nsecret, which I first described long ago in AUDIO LETTER No. 28. \nIt was a plan for the United States to arm to the teeth in secret\nwhile appearing to disarm gradually.  Without repeating all the\ndetails, the basic idea was grandiose yet simple.  By\ndeliberately appearing weak, the Rockefeller-controlled United\nStates would maneuver itself into a nuclear war with Russia. \nThen the secret weapons, including superweapons, would be\nunleashed to smash Russia and take over the world.\n\n   When they set the grand plan in motion in 1961, the\nRockefeller Brothers were looking ahead to a nuclear war by the\nlate 1970s.  Their military analysts concluded very early that\nthe war being planned would have very different effects on the\nNorthern and Southern Hemispheres.  Both superpowers, the United\nStates and the Soviet Union, are located well up in the Northern\nHemisphere; so are the other full-fledged nuclear powers--Great\nBritain, France, Red China, and India.  By contrast, the\nstrategic targets for nuclear war in the Southern Hemisphere are\nrelatively few and far between.  In other words, it was expected\nthat the coming nuclear war would be essentially a Northern\nHemisphere war.\n\n   In an all-out nuclear holocaust it is known that serious\nradioactive fallout will gradually spread to affect even areas\nnot initially hit by war.  But there are limits to how far the\nwar clouds can spread.  It was discovered long ago that there is\nvery little mixing between the air of the Northern and Southern\nHemispheres.  In the northern half of our planet, cold air from\nthe North Pole works its way southward towards the equator, then\nit works its way back to the north as warm air.  A mirror image\nof this process takes up the southern half of the planet. \nNorthern and Southern Hemisphere air meet in the equatorial zone,\nbut very little of the air changes places.\n\n   The military conclusion, my friends, is this: the coming\nnuclear war could ruin large areas of the Northern Hemisphere for\ngenerations to come; but if the calculations are right, the\nSouthern Hemisphere could escape virtually unaffected by the war. \nThis was music to the ears of the Four Rockefeller Brothers.  A\nquick look at the globe of the world shows why.  The Rockefeller\ncartel has dominated Latin America ever since World War II.  As I\ndiscussed in my very first monthly AUDIO LETTER, Nelson\nRockefeller solidified the cartel grip on Latin America during\nthe war.  He accomplished this as so-called "Coordinator of\nHemispheric Defense" for then-President Franklin D. Roosevelt. \nSo that takes care of the South American continent and its\nnatural resources.\n\n   Then there is the African continent.  There, too, Rockefeller\ncontrol was already in effect over wide areas of Black Africa,\nespecially south of the equator.  All this was thanks to the\nefforts of John D. Rockefeller III, as I detailed in AUDIO LETTER\nNo. 36.\n\n   Looking around the globe, the most important remaining land\nmasses from the standpoint of world domination are Australia and\nNew Zealand.  Thanks to World War II, both were wide open to the\nRockefellers.\n\n   The Rockefeller Brothers decided to establish secret military\ninstallations in the Southern Hemisphere for use after the coming\nwar.  By this means they expected to become the masters of the\nsurviving southern half of planet Earth after the Northern\nHemisphere war.  Then, as the Northern Hemisphere gradually\nrecovered from the nuclear holocaust, the Rockefeller empire\nwould be able to pick up the pieces.  In this way the third\ngeneration Rockefeller Brothers expected their family dynasty to\ninherit the Earth.\n\n   In order to control the Southern Hemisphere militarily after\nthe war, some means would have to be available to project\nmilitary power onto any land mass.  For example, revolts against\nRockefeller domination would require troops--not a blast from the\nbeam weapons on the Moon.  The most critical factor for postwar\nmilitary domination of the world was found to be a navy.  A\nminimum of two secret naval fleets would be required--one based\nin the South Atlantic, the other in the South Pacific.  Since the\nreserve naval fleets were to be kept secret until after the\nNorthern Hemisphere nuclear war, they could not be built in\nexisting shipyards.  New construction facilities had to be built\nand they had to be hidden.  To hide an entire shipyard is no\nsmall task; they take up a lot of space.  On top of that, it was\nessential that the ships remain hidden after they were built. \nThe best way to achieve that was to combine the shipyard and\nnaval base into one over-all secret installation.  Finally, the\nsecret naval installation had to be invulnerable to nuclear\nattack; otherwise if its existence were ever discovered\nprematurely, the secret navy might be wiped out.\n\n   The combined requirements for secrecy, space, and protection\nagainst attack were formidable; but one day in 1959, while all\nthese plans were still in the early stages of development, the\nanswer presented itself.  During a so-called banking trip to\nSweden, David Rockefeller was given a tour of a unique hidden\nnaval port.  The port is hollowed out from solid granite cliffs\nwhich come right down to the water.  The entrance to the port is\na gigantic hole in the side of the cliff which can be sealed off\nwith enormous steel doors.  Inside this big doorway on the water\na huge cavity has been hollowed out to accommodate ships.\n\n   The Rockefeller Brothers and their military adviser decided\nthat a bigger, more secret, better protected version of the\nSwedish hidden port was just what they wanted.  A survey of\ncandidate sites was then initiated.  The site survey covered\ncoastal areas throughout the Southern Hemisphere.  Many areas\nwere rejected very quickly because the topography was wrong. \nOther areas were rejected because they were too close to the\nequator.  Still others had to be ruled out because there were too\nmany people living nearby, making the desired level of secrecy\nimpossible.  Finally, it was essential that the sites chosen for\nthe secret naval installations be totally secure politically.\n\n   At last the sites for the secret naval installations were\nselected.  In the South Pacific, extreme southern New Zealand was\nselected.  This is what I was alluding to in AUDIO LETTER No. 71\nthree months ago when I called attention to New Zealand's extreme\nimportance in the coming war.\n\n   In order to obtain the necessary space, the secret New Zealand\nnaval installation had to be divided up into two sites located\nclose together.  One is at the extreme southwest tip of South\nIsland where the mountain range known as the Southern Alps comes\ndown virtually to the water's edge.  The other part of the\ninstallation is built into the northwest tip of Stewart Island,\nwhich is off the tip of South Island.  The Stewart Island\nfacility is hollowed out within a rise known as Mt. Anglem.\n\n   The New Zealand location met all the requirements.  Ever since\nWorld War II the government of New Zealand has been tied even\ncloser to the United States than to Great Britain.  The location\nis far from the equator, and the installations are buried deep\nunder mountains, protected from nuclear attack.  They are also\ntoo deep to be reached by particle-beam attacks, and the New\nZealand site is well situated to command the entire South\nPacific.\n\n   In the South Atlantic an even more perfect site was found. \nThat site, my friends, is South Georgia Island.  It is located\nperfectly for naval domination of the entire South Atlantic.  The\ntall, rugged mountains provided a perfect location for the secret\ninstallation at the northwest tip of the 100-mile long island. \nIt is controlled by Great Britain whose government, like that of\nNew Zealand, was willing to cooperate; and South Georgia Island\nwas virtually uninhabited except for a whaling station on the\nnortheast coast.  The whaling station was some 50 miles away from\nthe secret new installation which was being built, but Britain\ntook no chances.  In 1965 the whaling station was closed down. \nSince that time there have been no inhabitants on South Georgia\nIsland except for a few dozen alleged Antarctic scientists.\n\n   Construction of the secret naval facilities--two in New\nZealand, one on South Georgia Island--began in the early 1960's. \nThe techniques were adapted from those used previously to build\nother large underground facilities, such as the NORAD\ninstallation inside Cheyenne Mountain, Colorado; however these\ntechniques were adapted in radically new ways to achieve\nconstruction access directly from the sea instead of overland. \nIn this way, the sheltering mountain was left undisturbed in\nappearance both during and after construction.\n\n   The cuts in the mountain side which were necessary to let\nships in and out were kept as small as possible and were well\ncamouflaged.  Like the Swedish hidden naval port arrangement, the\nentrances to the secret installations can be sealed up.  When\nsealed, the entrance is virtually impossible to detect unless you\nknow exactly where it is; and unlike most large construction\nprojects, there are no tailings or piles of leftover rock lying\naround to attract attention.  The man-made caverns which house\nthe secret naval installations are enormous, but all the rock and\ndebris was disposed of at sea.\n\n   Once the secret naval facilities were built, they had to be\noutfitted for ship construction and docksite storage.  The fake\ndisarmament of the United States during the 1960s contributed\ngreatly to this task.  From 1961 to 1968 one man played a pivotal\nrole in this elaborate Rockefeller scheme.  He was then-Secretary\nof Defense Robert McNamara.  All through the 60's McNamara\npresided over the public paring back of America's visible\nmilitary power.  This included the closing down and dismantling\nof entire shipyards.  What we were not told was where all that\nshipyard equipment went afterwards.  Where it went, my friends,\nwas to the new secret installations which were being outfitted in\nNew Zealand and South Georgia Island!\n\n   The secret naval installations have been used as duplication\nfacilities to reproduce certain ships and submarines designed and\nbuilt here in the United States.  As Defense Secretary Caspar\nWeinberger told Congress recently, it is cheaper to build two\nships at a time.  That is especially true if the second ship is\nan exact duplicate of the first.  This has become even more true\nin recent years through the use of computerized manufacturing\ntechniques.\n\n   The secret naval fleets which have been built at the secret\ninstallations are made up of duplicates--exact duplicates of\ncertain other ships and submarines.  They are all nuclear\npowered--nuclear "subs"; nuclear cruisers; nuclear destroyers;\nand yes, nuclear aircraft carriers, three of them.  A secret twin\nwas built for the U.S.S. Nimitz, for the U.S.S. Eisenhower, and\nfor the newly-launched U.S.S. Carl Vincent.  All have been\nfinanced through the gigantic cost overruns, so called, that we\nconstantly hear about in the Defense Department; and all three\ncarriers have been provided with a full complement of aircraft\nwhose manufacture was financed the same way!\n\n   The ships of the secret American Bolshevik naval fleets are\nall duplicates of other nuclear-powered vessels.  Even so, the\nsecret naval ships possess one key difference.\n\n   Last month I revealed that the so-called "Stealth Program" has\nsucceeded in developing a kind of electromagnetic invisibility\nshield.  This technique makes an object invisible from a distance\nby distorting light waves in its vicinity.\n\n   A whole new fleet of Phantom war-planes are now going into\ncrash production that use this principle; and, my friends, all of\nthe secret American Bolshevik navy ships have already been\noutfitted with similar Stealth-field equipment!  The Stealth\nprinciple is actually easier to apply to ships than to airplanes\nbecause there is more room for the powerful equipment that\ngenerates the field.\n\n   After NUCLEAR WAR ONE, the secret Stealth navy of the American\nBolsheviks would be light years ahead of any other navy left on\nearth.  It would be perfect for the intended role of world\ndomination.  The Rockefellers set it all in motion long ago, my\nfriends, but three years ago they lost control of the United\nStates Military.  Now it's the American Bolsheviks who are in\ncontrol, and they are bent on war.\n\n   These secret naval installations have precipitated what is\nbeing called the "Falklands crisis."\n\nTopic #2--In AUDIO LETTER(R) No. 73 last month I described\n"PROJECT Z", the new Bolshevik three-phase strategy for NUCLEAR\nWAR ONE.\n\n   An elite group of American Bolshevik military planners here\nare flushing out the plan right now at a secret war-room here in\nWashington.  It's a plan by which the United States will strike\nthe first nuclear blow, followed by all-out thermonuclear war\nwith Russia.\n\n   Having set off the holocaust, the Bolsheviks here and in\ncertain other countries plan to rise it out safe in comfortable\nwar bunkers.  Finally after NUCLEAR WAR ONE fizzles out in\nstalemate, they plan to leave behind the ashes of the United\nStates and her allies.  Activating Phase #3 of their grand\nstrategy, they plan to unveil their secret weapons, especially\ntheir secret naval fleets.  With these they plan to conquer and\nrule what is left of the world.  The United States as we know it\nwill be dead and gone; but in the eyes of the Bolsheviks\nthemselves, this outcome will constitute victory.\n\n   Up to now the nuclear war timetable which I first revealed two\nmonths ago is still on track.  They are still shooting for\nnuclear war to begin by September of this year 1982!  Time is\nfast running out.\n\n   The Bolsheviks here are sprinting as fast as they can toward\nwar; but, my friends, the Bolsheviks are not the only runners in\nthis race.  They have two deadly enemies, both of whom are\nequally determined to trip up the Bolsheviks.  One enemy of the\nBolsheviks here is the Rockefeller cartel; the other enemy is the\nnew anti-Bolshevik ruling clique in Russia; and now these two\nmutual enemies of the Bolsheviks are pooling their efforts in\ncertain ways.\n\n   In AUDIO LETTER No. 71 three months ago I reported that a\nlimited, new anti-Bolshevik coalition was in the works between\nthe Rockefeller cartel and the Russians.  The January 26 meeting\nbetween Haig and Gromyko in Geneva, Switzerland, was a turning\npoint in the formation of this coalition.  It is now a reality,\nand is responsible for the so-called "Falkland crisis" now\ndominating the headlines.  It should be emphasized that this new\nrelationship between the Rockefeller cartel and Russia falls far\nshort of a true alliance.  They have very major disputes to be\nsettled between them, but for the time being they have called a\ntruce between themselves to deal with their mutual deadly\nenemy--the Bolsheviks here in America.\n\n   The first priority of the Russians and the Rockefellers is to\nslow down the Bolshevik preparations for imminent nuclear war. \nIf they can do that, time is on the side of the Rockefeller\ncartel in certain political movements which I discussed last\nsummer in AUDIO LETTER No. 67.  A slow-down in the nuclear war\ntimetable will also give more breathing space for additional\nanti-Bolshevik actions to be implemented.\n\n   The joint Rockefeller-Russian planners decided by mid-February\nthat military action against the Bolsheviks was essential very\nquickly.  No other type of action had any hope of taking effect\nfast enough to prevent nuclear war by the end of this summer.\n\n   The exact details of the "PROJECT Z" war plan are not known to\neither the Rockefellers or the Russians, but the general outlines\nare known to be as I described last month.\n\n   It was decided that military action should be devised that\nwould undermine Phase #3 of the Bolshevik war plan--that is, the\nBolshevik-controlled secret naval installations and fleets in the\nSouthern Hemisphere should be attacked and crippled.  By working\ntogether, the Rockefeller cartel and the Russians were able to\ndevise an attack plan which neither could have carried out alone. \nThe Rockefeller group, who built and originally controlled these\nbases, provided detailed Intelligence about the best way to\nattack them.  The Russians with their enormous military machine\nprovided the muscle to actually carry out the attack.\n\n   It was essential to devise a scheme that would enable both\nsecret fleets in the South Atlantic and South Pacific to be\nattacked.  Survival intact of either fleet would leave the\nBolshevik war plan still workable.\n\n   Military analysts concluded very quickly that a direct assault\non the New Zealand facilities was out of the question.  There was\nno combination of commandos, frogmen, or other military force\nwhich could possibly keep an attack secret from the outside\nworld.  Any attack on the New Zealand bases would set off the\nvery war which the Rockefellers and Russians want to prevent.\n\n   But the situation in the South Atlantic was a different\nmatter.  In a way, the greatest asset of South Georgia Island was\nalso its Achilles' heel.  The extreme isolation which protected\nthe secrecy of the South Georgia base also made a covert military\nassault feasible.  The key lay with Argentina and her\nlong-standing claims to the Falkland Islands.\n\n   As I mentioned in Topic #1, the Rockefeller cartel has\ndominated all of Latin America for decades.  Cartel operatives\nwere sent to Argentina to work out a deal with the government\nmilitary junta there.  The historic dispute over the Falkland\nIslands was to be used to provide a ruse, a military cover, to\nenable the South Georgia base to be attacked.  The Argentine\ngenerals were not told everything about the situation by any\nmeans, but they were told enough to make clear what they were to\ndo.\n\n   As an inducement to cooperate, the Argentine leaders were\npromised handsome rewards.  They were guaranteed that after the\nshooting was over, the Falkland Islands would remain in Argentine\nhands.  This guarantee included the promise of covert military\nassistance as needed against the Royal Navy.  And to bolster the\ntroubled Argentine economy, it was promised that the Rockefeller\ncartel will help develop the immense offshore oil reserves.  With\nthese combined promises of military glory and financial rewards,\nthe Argentine military junta agreed to the plan.\n\n   On March 19 Argentina carried out Act #1 in the joint attack\nplan.  A group of Argentine scrap-metal merchants, of all things,\nlanded at the abandoned old whaling station on South Georgia\nIsland.  Supposedly they were there to dismantle the old\nbuildings and cart them off to sell.  While they were at it they\nalso raised the Argentine flag over the work-site.  The British,\nalways nervous about South Georgia Island, promptly reacted as\nexpected.  The British Antarctic survey ship "Endurance" put 22\nMarines ashore.  They drove off the scrap merchants and tore down\nthe Argentine flag.\n\n   The incident provided the desired excuse for the Argentine\nJunta to bring the simmering 150-year-old Falklands dispute to a\nboil.  From time to time in the past, Argentina has claimed that\nSouth Georgia is part of the Falklands because it is administered\nthat way by Britain.  That argument is very flimsy but it now\ncame in very handy.  It was nothing new to hear this from\nArgentine leaders, so there was no hint of what was really afoot.\n\n   During late March, Argentine military forces started\nassembling for an assault on the Falklands.  "Nothing new",\nthought the British high command.  Argentina has carried out\nthreatening maneuvers in the past many times.  It was believed\nthat they were about to do it again; but on April 2 Argentine\nforces did the unexpected.  After many past false alarms, this\ntime they actually invaded and seized the Islands.  All Argentine\npublic statements emphasized the long-standing historical claims\nto the Falklands themselves; but just for good measure, the next\nday a small Argentine force also seized far-off South Georgia\nIsland.  The force was so small that it gave the appearance\ninitially that it was just a side show from Argentina's point of\nview; however, the small contingent of 22 Royal Marines were\noverpowered and bundled off the Island along with a group of 13\nalleged scientists.  That was the moment of payoff in the joint\nRockefeller-Russian attack plan.\n\n   Thanks to the elaborate distraction staged by the Argentine\nforces, a special commando team got onto the Island undetected. \nBased on the detailed Rockefeller information about the base, the\nteam moved to a location on the mountain directly above the\ncavernous secret base.  Special high-speed drilling equipment was\nset up by the Rockefeller members of the team while the Russian\nmembers concentrated on military defense.  By late that evening,\nApril 3, the military high command in London finally learned what\nwas really taking place.  The secret South Georgia base was under\nattack by virtually the only means possible.  The joint\nRockefeller-Russian team were drilling a shaft down through the\nmountain toward the hollowed out cavern inside.  It was only a\nmatter of time until their drill would break through the ceiling\nof the giant hidden naval base.  Once the hole was made, the next\nstep was obvious.  The Rockefeller-Russian team would put a\nweapon of some kind through the hole.  The best guess was that it\nwould be a nerve gas.\n\n   The shock waves that went through the highest levels of the\nBritish government on the evening of April 3 can hardly be\ndescribed, my friends.  The Thatcher government, like the\nso-called Reagan Administration here in America, is Bolshevik\ncontrolled.  That's why Margaret Thatcher always says, "Me, too"\nany time the Reagan Administration says or does anything against\nRussia.  Both governments are party to the secret nuclear war\nplan in complete betrayal of the people of their respective\ncountries, and on the evening of April 3 they suddenly discovered\nthat their precious war plan was in deep, deep trouble.\n\n   Immediately the Thatcher government started assembling a naval\narmada to sail for the South Atlantic.  Haste was the order of\nthe day.  The drilling on South Georgia Island was proceeding\naround the clock.  The best estimates were that the drilling\nwould break through into the roof of the naval base in about\nthree weeks, on or about April 24.  If help did not reach South\nGeorgia by then, the secret installation might be doomed.  The\nforces stationed at the installation itself were unable to defend\nthemselves under the circumstances.  Their mighty naval ships\nwere ships in a bottle.  They did not dare open the bottle to\nsail out to fight because the Russian commandos were armed with\ntactical and nuclear weapons.  To open the blast-proof entrance\ndoors would be suicide.\n\n   On April 5, just two days after South Georgia Island was\nseized, some 40 naval ships began moving out of British ports. \nThe same day Lord Carrington was sacked as Foreign Minister.  He\nwas forced to resign, my friends, because he had assisted the\nRockefeller attack plan by downplaying the Argentine attack\npreparations.\n\n   That same day, April 5, New Zealand, the home of the other\nsecret naval fleet, broke diplomatic relations with Argentina. \nThe two hidden New Zealand facilities had been placed on "Red\nAlert."  As a precautionary measure, all submarines at the twin\nbase were ordered to sea.  Several surface ships were already at\nsea undergoing "sea trials", but that still left seven (7) major\nships inside the hidden twin naval base including one of the\nnuclear aircraft carriers I mentioned earlier.\n\n   On that busy day of April 5, Argentina's Foreign Minister,\nCosta Mendez, was at the United Nations in New York.  He was\nalarmed by the deployment of such a large part of the Royal Navy. \nCosta Mendez hurried here to Washington to seek reassurances from\ncertain officials.  He got them!\n\n   For the next two weeks or so the news was filled with stories\nabout the allegedly slow movement of the British fleet while\nnegotiations went on.  That, my friends, was only a cover story. \nThe Royal Navy was actually joining up and moving as rapidly as\npossible toward South Georgia Island.  If the task force arrived\nin time to save the secret base, a major battle was likely.  The\nofficial stories about "slow movement" of the British armada were\nintended to give a cushion of time for that battle.  If need be,\nthe fleet would have several days to retake South Georgia Island,\nthen it could move on to arrive near the Falklands on the\nannounced schedule.  In this way the crucial importance of South\nGeorgia Island would be hidden and the big secret preserved.\n\n   It was initially expected that advance elements of the British\nfleet would reach the vicinity of South Georgia Island within two\nweeks.  That would have been soon enough to attack the joint\nRockefeller-Russian commando team and stop the drilling before it\nwas completed.  But Russian Cosmospheres and submarines made a\nshambles of the plan.\n\n   Key advance elements of the South Georgia attack contingent\nleft Ascension Island early April 14, two days before it was\nannounced officially.  Shortly after they did so, they ran into\ntrouble.  Russian Cosmospheres and attack submarines closed in on\na single ship which was critical to the planned counterassault on\nSouth Georgia Island.  The Cosmospheres bombarded the bridge and\ncombat information center of the ship with neutron radiation.  In\nmoments the ship was without any command, its communications and\nradar silenced.  Then a Russian "sub" closed in and quickly\nfinished off this key British ship with torpedoes.  It broke\napart with secondary explosions and sank rapidly.  So far as is\nknown, there were no survivors.\n\n   This unexpected shock in the mid-Atlantic produced two\nresults, both important:\n\nFirst, it caused a slowdown in the race toward the South Atlantic\nby the British armada.  The task force had to be regrouped into a\nconfiguration better suited for an enroute defense, but that cost\nvaluable time.  Public announcements from London about the\nprogress of the fleet reflected this slowdown.  The timetable for\narrival on battle stations near the Falklands started stretching\nout longer and longer.  All this bought extra time for the joint\ncommando team on South Georgia Island.  The drilling continued.\n\nThe other result of the sinking was equally important.  Word was\nflashed to the South Pacific Stealth navy to prepare for possible\naction.  It was obvious that the Russian Navy was getting\ninvolved in the Atlantic, which meant that the Royal Navy could\nbe in big trouble.  During the dead of night, early April 15, the\nseven Stealth ships put to sea from their twin secret bases in\nsouthern New Zealand.  They deployed to a secret operational\nheadquarters area in the Antipodes Islands, 450 miles southeast\nof New Zealand.  Their electromagnetic shields were operating to\nprovide protection from attack.  These shields make it impossible\nto communicate with the outside world or even to see it, as I\nexplained last month; but once they arrived at the Antipodes, the\nStealth ships hooked up to buoys equipped with shielded\ncommunication cables to the Island headquarters.  The Antipodes\nheadquarters, in turn, was in constant touch with the South\nGeorgia base by way of a transoceanic cable around the tip of\nSouth America.  The deployment of the available ships of the\nSouth Pacific Stealth fleet was exactly what the joint\nRockefeller-Russian planners had hoped for.  The ships had been\nflushed out from their essentially invulnerable hiding place in\nNew Zealand!\n\n   The British ship's sinking of April 14 was also followed by\nother events.  On April 15 the Argentine Navy started moving out\nof port.  The same day, Alexander Haig arrived again in Buenos\nAires.  Supposedly he was there as a diplomat, but in reality he\nwas there as a General, dealing with Generals.  Haig is the top\nGovernmental operative of the Rockefeller cartel, as I have\nrevealed in the past.  He was making sure that the Argentines did\nnot get cold feet and back down at that critical moment.  Four\ndays later, April 19, Haig left for Washington.  As he boarded\nhis plane, Haig somberly told reporters, "Time is running out." \nAnd so it was, my friends, for the secret South Georgia base.\n\n   The very next day, April 20, the drill broke through into the\nhollowed-out cavern of the naval base.  Bolshevik military\nanalysts in London had not expected that it could be completed\nuntil at least the following weekend.  The British fleet was\nstill out of range.\n\n   The weapon which the commando team inserted down through the\nlong hole was a small, compact Russian neutron bomb.  When it was\ndetonated inside the confines of the huge artificial cave, the\neffects were devastating.  The intense radiation instantly killed\neveryone inside the base.  Also the heat and blast effects of the\nbomb are believed to have damaged all the ships inside\nsufficiently to badly disable them.\n\n   Meanwhile, Russian Cosmospheres and submarines were converging\non the Stealth ships which were near the Antipodes Islands\nawaiting orders.  From a distance, the ships were invisible to\nthe eye due to their protective shields, which also protect\nagainst beam-weapon attack; but they were sitting ducks for the\ntactics which the Russians employed.\n\n   Floating overhead, the Cosmospheres located the seven ships\nusing their Psychoenergetic Range-Finding equipment known as PRF. \nAs I have reported in the past, there is no method known by which\nPRF can be jammed.  The Cosmospheres radioed the exact locations\nof the ships to the attack submarines.  The "subs" were armed\nwith special non-homing, non-nuclear torpedoes designed to\nexplode on impact.  More sophisticated torpedoes would have been\nthrown off course or detonated prematurely by the protective\nshield of each ship; but these simple torpedoes just cruise right\nthrough each invisibility field to strike the ship and explode. \nWithin 15 minutes after the attack began, all seven Bolshevik\nStealth ships were on their way to the bottom, and with them went\ntheir Bolshevik Commanders and mercenary crews collected from\naround the world.\n\n   The South Pacific action took place just after sunset local\ntime.  The time here in Washington was around 2:00 P.M. April 23. \nThat evening Secretary of State Haig was seen briefly in public\nwith the new British Foreign Minister, Francis Pym.  Pym was\nwearing the artificial pseudo-smile which diplomats are taught\nalways to display in public.  But not Haig.  Haig was grinning\nfrom ear to ear, and no wonder.  The joint Rockefeller-Russian\nmilitary operation had been a brilliant success.  The secret\nBolshevik South Atlantic fleet had been virtually wiped out,\nbottled up inside South Georgia Island; and the South Pacific\nfleet, while not totally wiped out, had been badly crippled.  By\nworking together, the Rockefeller cartel and the Russians had won\nthe secret naval war of the Southern Hemisphere.\n\nTopic #3--As I say these words, news reports give the impression\nthat war is about to erupt in the South Atlantic, but the real\nwar in the Southern Hemisphere is already over.  What we are\nwatching now is the beginning of its bloody aftermath.  That\naftermath is the battle for the Falkland Islands.  They have been\npromised to Argentina as a reward for her role in the secret war.\n\n   At this moment the Bolsheviks here in Washington are pressing\nfor a public announcement that the United States will side with\nBritain.  As soon as that takes place, military action will heat\nup fast around the Falklands.  Britain has no choice but to\nfight.  She has already suffered casualties which cannot be\nexplained without a public battle; but by fighting, the\nBolsheviks in Britain are running the risk of a humiliating and\ntragic defeat for the Royal Navy.\n\n   Meanwhile, the Rockefeller strategists here are now\nconcentrating on a fast-building, anti-nuclear-war campaign.  On\nall sides now we are hearing about the so-called "nuclear freeze\nmovement."  There are documentaries, articles, publicity of all\nkinds to sensitize us to the terrors of nuclear war.  In recent\nmonths, there have even been referenda popping up on election\nballots dealing with the nuclear war issue.  Medical doctors are\nbanding together to warn the public about what would happen if\nthere were a nuclear war.\n\n   We are being told that all this is just popping up\nspontaneously.  We are now 37 years into the nuclear age and\nnothing like this has ever gained so much momentum before, yet\nnow we are supposed to believe that millions of Americans have\nspontaneously gotten the same ideas at the same time.  If you\nbelieve that, my friends, I give up.  Movements like this never,\nand I mean never, develop without leadership, organization, and\nmoney--and plenty of it.\n\n   What we are watching is the Rockefeller public relations\nmachine at work.  As I've explained in the past, the Rockefeller\ncartel cannot afford to let a nuclear war take place.  If it\ndoes, they will lose everything because they are not in a\nposition to control it.  Instead, the deadly enemies of the\nRockefeller cartel, the Bolsheviks here, will win out if there is\na war; and so the Rockefeller faction is now doing everything in\nits power to prevent a nuclear war.\n\n   The present anti-nuclear-war orientation of the Rockefeller\ncartel creates certain temporary common interests between them\nand Russia; but as Russia's new rulers know very well, this does\nnot spring from any great moral perspective on the part of the\nRockefeller group.  It's purely a matter of practical necessity\nright now for the Rockefellers.\n\n   The Russians regard the United States as a house divided, and\nthey are exploiting that division by working in careful ways with\nthe Rockefellers.  Their first priority is to rid the world of\nthe deadly Bolshevik menace of all-out, even suicidal, nuclear\nwar; but once that is done, they know that there will be a day of\nreckoning with the Rockefeller cartel some day.\n\n   The Rockefeller group is working toward a definite objective\nwith their new anti-nuclear-war propaganda.  That objective is\nrenewed power--and power that moves them closer to their old\ndream of WORLD GOVERNMENT.  The Bolsheviks here have unwittingly\nprovided fertile ground for the powerful new Rockefeller antiwar\ncampaign.  Under Bolshevik control, the so-called Reagan\nAdministration has become so hawkish that it's scaring people. \nThe Rockefeller antiwar campaign is designed to capitalize on\nthat latent fear as a tool of power.\n\n   These days the smell of war is in the air.  The Falklands\ncrisis is helping to make that more intense.  The Rockefeller\npropaganda machine is now paving the way for the argument that\nsurrender of sovereignty is the only way to avoid war.  A new\nsuper-United Nations of sorts is now in the works to fill the\nbill.  It will have teeth!  As presently envisioned, the new\norganization will be based in Geneva, Switzerland.  The working\nname, though this may be changed, is the "World Nonproliferation\nCouncil."  The plan is to bring it into being as the outgrowth of\nnuclear nonproliferation treaties, but its true purpose will be\nto use fear--the fear of war--to control us all.\n\n                       LAST MINUTE SUMMARY\n\n   Now it's time for my Last Minute Summary.  In this AUDIO\nLETTER I have reported on the reasons behind the so-called\nFalkland Islands crisis.  The crisis erupted because of secret\nBolshevik-controlled naval installations in the Southern\nHemisphere.  These have been attacked by joint action of the\nRockefeller cartel and the Russians in an attempt to slow down\nthe nuclear-war timetable.  The attacks were successful, but the\nresults remain to be seen.  One result, though, is that the Royal\nNavy has now been drawn into a trap.  Britain's Waterloo at sea\nmay well be at hand.\n\n   My friends, two factions are struggling for control over our\nUnited States--the Rockefeller cartel and the Bolsheviks.  They\ndiffer in style but both seek to control us through fear.  If we\nare ever to rise above their trickery, it must be through the\npower of our Lord Jesus Christ, our only hope.  As the Scripture\ntells us, our Lord "...has not given us the spirit of fear; but\nof power, of love, and of a sound mind."  We must learn to wage\npeace.  As our Lord declared long ago, "Blessed are the\npeacemakers: for they shall be called sons of God."

THE WHITE HOUSE\n\n                  Office of the Press Secretary\n                    (Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania)\n______________________________________________________________\nFor Immediate Release                         April 17, 1993     \n\n	     \n                    INTERVIEW OF THE PRESIDENT\n                      BY MICHAEL WHITELY OF\n                    KDKA-AM RADIO, PITTSBURGH\n	     \n                 Pittsburgh International Airport\n                     Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania    \n\n\n\n10:40 A.M. EDT\n	     \n	     \n	     Q	  For everyone listening on KDKA Radio, I'm Mike \nWhitely, KDKA Radio News.  We're here at the Pittsburgh \nInternational Airport and with me is the President of the United \nStates Bill Clinton.\n	     \n	     And I'd like to welcome you to the area and to KDKA.\n	     \n	     THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Mike.  Glad to be here.\n	     \n	     Q	  There are a lot of things we'd like to talk \nabout in the brief amount of time we have, but some news is just \nbreaking from Los Angeles.  I guess the entire country has been \nkind of holding their breath, wondering what's going to happen in \nthe trial of the four Los Angeles police officers.  We just heard \nthat two of those officers, the sergeant, Sergeant Koon and \nOfficer Powell have been found guilty, and two officers have been \nfound not guilty.\n	     \n	     It's a situation that's been building for over a \nyear since the first trial and now this trial and this verdict.  \nAnd I wonder what your thoughts are this morning on how you see \nthe situation in Los Angeles in connection with your \nadministration and what you're trying to do.\n	     \n	     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, first of all, I think the \nAmerican people should know that this trial, in my judgment, is a \ntribute to the work and judgment of the jury, as well as to the \nefforts of the federal government in developing the case.\n	     \n	     The law under which the officers were tried is a \ncomplex one; the standards of proof are complicated.  The jury \ndecided that they would convict the sergeant who was responsible \nfor supervising the officers and the officer who on the film did \nmost of the beating.  The jury acquitted an officer who kicked \nRodney King, but also plainly tried to shield him from some \nblows, and another officer who was a rookie.\n	     \n	     No one knows exactly why they did what they did, but \nit appears that they really tried to do justice here.  They \nacknowledged that his civil rights were violated.  And I think \nthat the American people should take a lot of pride in that.  But \nI hope now we can begin to look ahead and focus on three things:  \nfirst of all, the importance of trying to bring this country \ntogether and not violate the civil rights of any American; \nsecondly, the importance of renewing our fight against crime.  \n	     \n	     I think it's important to recognize that in the \npoorest areas of Los Angeles and many other cities in this \ncountry, people may be worried about police abuse, but they're \neven more worried about crime.  It's time that we renewed our \nefforts to go to community policing -- put 100,000 more police \nofficers on the street; pass the Brady Bill that would require a \nwaiting period before people could buy a handgun, and do some \nother things to reduce the vulnerability of our people to \nviolence and drugs.\n	     \n	     And the last point I'd like to make is it seems to \nme that we have got to rededicate ourselves to the economic \nrevitalization of our cities and other economically-distressed \nareas.  If you just think about it -- if everybody in Los Angeles \nwho wanted a job had one, I don't think we'd have quite as many \nproblems as we do.  \n	     \n	     And I laid out a very ambitious program in the \ncampaign to try to bring private investment and public investment \nto bear in our cities.  I have dispatched the Commerce Secretary, \nRon Brown, to California to try to come up with some strategies \nfor that state, because it's our biggest state with our highest \nunemployment rate -- which could then be applied around the \ncountry.  I want to talk to him and to the Attorney General, to \nthe new head of the NAACP, to Reverend Jackson, and to several \nother people, and then I'll decide where to go from here with \nregard to Los Angeles and the other cities of the country.\n	     \n	     Q	  Let's talk about what brings you to the \nPittsburgh area today.  There have been -- I guess there's been a \nlot of discussion on Capitol Hill about your stimulus package.  \nYou've been locked in a battle with the GOP.  Yesterday, as you \nsaid earlier in your radio address, you made some moves to break \nthat gridlock.  What brings you to Pittsburgh, in particular to \nAllegheny County, in particular to Pennsylvania, with that \nbattle?\n	     \n	     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, there are two reasons.  First \nof all, Pittsburgh, Allegheny County and Pennsylvania supported \nme in the last election because they wanted a new direction in \neconomic policy.  We have passed our overall economic plan; it \ngives the country a very different budget for the next five years \nthan we've had in the previous 12.  We reduced the deficit and, \nat the same time, increased investment in jobs and education and \nhealth care, in the things that will make us a stronger country.\n	     \n	     But in addition to that, I asked the Congress in the \nshort run to spend a little more money, a modest amount of money \nto create another half-million jobs in the next year and a half; \nto try to cut the unemployment rate by a half a percent; but also \nto try to spark job creation in the private sector more.  The \nplan passed the House.  It has the support of a majority of the \nSenate.  At the present time, all the Republican   senators as a \nbloc are filibustering the bill.  That is, they won't let it come \nto a vote.\n	     \n	     I believe that Senator Specter would like to vote \nfor the bill.  And I believe that Senator Dole, the Republican \nleader, has put a lot of pressure on a lot of the Republicans to \nstay hitched.  And they're all saying that this bill increases \nthe deficit.  It doesn't.  This bill is well below the spending \ntargets that Congress approved, including the Republicans, for \nthis year.  This bill is paid for by budget cuts in the next five \nyears.  This bill is designed to give a jump-start to the \neconomy.  And I must say, a lot of the Republican senators that \nare holding it up, when Mr. Bush was President, voted for \nbillions of dollars of emergency spending of just this kind --\nmuch of it was totally unrelated to creating jobs.\n	     \n	     So what I'm trying to do is to break this logjam.  \nI've held out an olive branch, I've offered a compromise.  But I \nthink that we ought to try to put some more Americans to work \nright now to show that we're changing the direction of the \ncountry.  And that's the purpose of the bill.\n	     \n	     Q	  Have you been in touch with Senator Specter or \nhis office lately?\n	     \n	     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, we've been trying to talk \nregularly to -- through my White House Congressional Liaison \noperation to the senators that we think are open to this --\nSenator Specter, Senator D'Amato from New York, Senator Jeffords \nfrom Vermont, Senator Hatfield from Oregon, and five or six \nothers whom we believe know we need more jobs in this economy and \nknow that we are paying for this with budget cuts over the life \nof the budget I presented.\n	     \n	     You know, it has a lot of appeal to say, well, we've \ngot a big deficit, we shouldn't increase it more.  But the truth \nis that we are paying for this with budget cuts in the whole life \nof the budget over the next few years.  And more importantly, we \nhave this program well below the spending targets that Congress \nhas already approved for this year.  And they've done this for \nyears, with the Republicans voting for it -- many Republicans \nvoting for it -- for things that weren't nearly as important as \nputting the American people back to work.  \n	     \n	     So I just hope that this doesn't become a political \nissue.  It ought to just be about the people of this country and \nthe need for jobs.\n	     \n	     Q	  I have some questions from people who supported \nyou, and some people who are skeptical about your administration.  \nIt has to do with their hopes, and also with their fears.  A lot \nof people who supported you and voted for you in Pennsylvania --I \nthink some of them are now saying, we're glad we got him in the \nWhite House, but now look at this incredible process he has to go \nthrough.  Look at these problems.  Look at this gridlock.  And \nthey're beginning to wonder, is this going to work; can you pull \nit off?  And, of course, your skeptics are saying, well, I knew \nit was going to be like this.\n	     \n	     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, what I would -- I'd ask \npeople, first of all, to remember that we are, frankly, moving \nvery fast.  The budget resolution that the Congress passed is the \nfastest they have ever passed a budget resolution -- ever -- in \nhistory, setting out the next five-year budget targets.  So we \nare moving really rapidly.  And we've got them working on \npolitical reform, welfare reform, health care reform, a whole \nwide range of things.  \n	     \n	     But it's a big operation.  You can't expect to turn \nit around overnight.  It took 12 years to produce the conditions \nwhich led to the victory I received from the people in November, \nand we can't turn it around in 90 days.  But I think we're making \nreal, real progress.  \n	     \n	     I would urge the people not to get discouraged.  \nWe're not going to win every battle, and not everything is going \nto happen overnight.  But we are definitely moving and changing \nthings.\n	     \n	     Q	  Thank you very much.  \n	     \n	     The President of the United States, Bill Clinton, \nhere live at Pittsburgh International Airport.  I'm Mike Whitely, \nKDKA News.
Here's my own top ten response to Mr. Ipser's list\n\n\n10.  It's about time we have a President that might actually stand up to the\n     military.  Our men and women in uniform must learn that the world does not\n     revolve around them, and that one of the things they're out there defending\n     is our right to be critical of them, even denounce them.\n\n9.   Let me explain something to you.  Environmental policy and industrial\n     policy MUST go hand in hand.  Our nation, and indeed, our planet cannot\n     afford to continue ignoring this as was done over the last twelve years.\n     Our industrial/environmental position has been downright SHAMEFUL! We\n     must have active government support of the key industries such as,\n     telecommunications, microelectronics, medical, biotech, and environmental\n     tech.  Meanwhile weed out old, inneficient, high-polution, industries\n     that are better left to other nations.  This will make us richer, help\n     produce new jobs, and help the environment.  To give credit where credit\n     is due, I heard a lot of this in a speech by Senator John Kerry (D-MA)\n     tonite.  In addition, it's time we get really, really serious about \n     issues like overpopulation, globabl warming, and ozone depletion.  The\n     planet on which we live should be our utmost priority!\n\n8.   It just so happens that that it takes money to make this country work,\n     to provide the services that people need, and to help solve the problems\n     that need to be solved.  Granted, some things can probably be done more\n     efficiently for less money, and should be.  But some things are going to\n     cost more money and I'm sick and tired of hearing everyone whining about\n     taxes all the time.  You want to live in my country, you pay your fair\n     share!\n\n7.   I can't believe what hypocrites people are when they ask people to give\n     up their lives for their country and then complain about taxes.  If you're\n     willing to send me off to die for some stupid obsession with fighting an\n     enemy which at best doesn't affect us and at worst really should be our\n     friend, then you have no right to tell me you shouldn't pay taxes!\n\n6.   Hey, I think the beaded curtains add a lovely 60's-esque touch!\n\n5.   Look, Canada, Europe, and Japan manage to provide health care for their\n     citizens (and, yes, basic health IS a human right which people are\n     entitled to).  If these nations aren't capitalist enough for you, then\n     I guess we've found something better than capitalism!

Contrary to popular belief, it is possible to be a male and a feminist\n     at the same time.  To discriminate against or to deny equal opportunity\n     to a MAJORITY of the population is just plain wrong, and trying to force\n     them into some sort of tradition role is even worse.  Women certainly \n     have as much to offer this world as men, and the day that gender\n     discrimination is finally broken it going to make all the revolutions of\n     the past few centuries seem like reform bills.

OK, I admit I have no hard data on this. Why don't you help me with this?\nIf you would compile a commented list of all grants, un-repaid loans (if any),\nand direct aid, I'd be very interested to see it. If you could give me\nreferences from, for example, Congressional Budget Authorization Hearings,\nI could look them up here and I'd be happy to post a verification of your\ndata.\n\nOtherwise, I'll try my hand at this, but unfortunately I won't have sufficient\ntime available until the end of this month, so the results would be delayed.\n\nLet me know if you're interested in doing this.\n\n___Samuel___\nMossad Special Agent ID314159\nMedia Spiking and Mind Control Division\nLos Angeles Offices
No, it's a sign of aristocrtic out-of-touchness with the middle\nclass.  You ask George Herbert Walker Bush about that.\n\nAnd that's not his full name?  What, then, is it?\n\n---\n"Even Quayle had his honeymoon period.  It lasted a full 48 hours \nafter he was chosen as Bush's running mate."
Again, Mr. Frank has come to the rescue with his cool headed reason.  How\nabout, "One charge per victim?"  Of course I'll think about it in a few days\nand find a case where this doesn't apply either.  \n\nWhat the heck, I don't study law, I just hate lawyers. :)
Yes, sadly, this is true. The primary reason, and the essence of the\ndetails that you are seeking, is that the Grahm-Rudman budget controls\nwere working.  In fact, they were working so well that unless the feds\ndid something, they were going to have to start cutting pork. So Bush\nand the Democrats got together in a Budget Summit and replaced\nGrahm-Rudman with the now historic Grand Compromise in which Bush\n"consented" to raise taxes in exchange for certain caps on spending\nincreases.\n\nAs it turned out, the taxes killed the Reagan expansion and the caps\non spending increases were dispelled by Clinton in his first act as\nPresident (so that he could create his own new plan with more tax\nincreases).\n\nThe result is that Clinton now HOPES to reduce the deficit to a level \nABOVE where it was when Reagan left office.
Clinton has backed off from the $16 billion jobs bill.\n\n	Word is he's paring it down to the core: jobless benefits, money for\ncreating full time jobs (ie, no summer jobs money).\n\n	Chalk one up for holding the line on spending.
Such as?  Not being able to get married isn't a roadblock to a permanent\nrelationship.  Lack of a marriage certificate doesn't force a couple\nto break up.  This is an excuse used by homosexuals because the \nalternative is to ask why they are so much more promiscuous than \nstraights.
So that's why the 13 newly independent states all had tax systems...

Not true. I am required to have insurance by law. the method of collection\neffectively makes it a tax.\n\n\n\nWell here we have the right hoping for more selfish bastards. Pity they\ndon't look at what 12 years of the Regan/Bush "selfish Bastard" ecconomy\nhas done to the country.\n\nElect a selfish bastard government and they will run the country for themselves,\nthats why they are selfish bastards. Bush and Regan gave tax breaks for the\nultra rich and paid for them by borrowing against the incomes of the middle\nclass.

While I\nrespect his right to do so, my own opinions are that (1) "Followup-To"\nfields are mere suggestions, not mandatory commands and (2) this issue\nis of sufficient (a) general political relevance and (b) civil liberties\ninterest to warrant keeping it active in t.p.m and a.s.c-l as well, at\nleast for this round.]\n\n\n\nOkay, now here's my interpretation of _Boomer_, based on the facts as\npresented in the New York Court of Appeals<*> holding (_Boomer v.\n\n<*>Note: The New York Court of Appeals is the highest court in New York\n   State.  While the United States and 48 of the fifty states call their\n   highest court "Supreme Court," "Supreme Judicial Court" or "Supreme\n   Court of Appeals," Maryland and New York call theirs simply the\n   "Court of Appeals."  To make matters worse, New York also calls its\n   _second-highest_ court the "Supreme Court, Appellate Division"...\n\nAtlantic Cement Co._, 26 N.Y.2d 219, 257 N.E.2d 870 (1970)):\n\nOscar H. Boomer, et al., owned land near the Atlantic Cement company's\nplant near Albany, N.Y.  (The fact pattern gives no information as to\nwhich came first, the plaintiff's acquisition of the land or he\ndefendant's start of production at their cement plant.)  In the course\nof its regular operations, the cement plant did injury to the\nplaintiffs' property via dirt, smoke and vibrations emanating from the\nplant.  The plaintiffs sought injunctive relief -- that is, they asked\nthe court to order Atlantic Cement to stop damaging their property.\n\n(Commentary: this seems entirely reasonable to me.  Boomer at al owned\ntheir property and, presumably, a right to quiet enjoyment of it.\nAtlantic Cement's actions were depriving Boomer et al of that right.)\n\nInstead of granting the plaintiffs' request for an injunction, the court\nordered them to accept the damage being done to their property, provided\nthat Atlantic Cement paid them $185,000 in compensatory damages.  In\nother words, the court granted Atlantic Cement Co., a private party, the\npower and authority to _take_ the plaintiffs rights to quiet enjoyment\nof their property by eminent domain.  A taking by eminent domain is\nalways problematical even when it's done by the state; allowing a\nprivate firm to do it is, in my opinion, totally wrong.\n\n(Yes, I know, the _Boomer_ court didn't call it eminent domain.  But if\nit walks like eminent domain and swims like eminent domain and quacks\nlike eminent domain...)\n\nLet me take issue with the way you've presented the case... you say that\n"What happened in _Boomer_ was that the judge didn't allow the\nplaintiffs to blackmail the cement plant by demanding a multi-million\ndollar plant to be shut down over $185,000 in damages."  Blackmail?\n\n    (Pulls out Black's Law Dictionary, Abridged 5th Edition....\n    "Blackmail: Unlawful demand of money or property under threat to\n    do bodily harm, to injure property, to accuse of crime, or to expose\n    disgraceful defects.  This crime is commonly included under\n    extortion statutes.")\n\nHow do you define as "blackmail" one party's act of demanding the right\nto set its own sale price for a unique piece of property which it owns\nand which another party has expressed an interest in buying?  Or of\ndemanding the right not to sell that property at any price?  As I see\nit, Boomer et al, having found themselves in the fortunate position of\nowning something which Atlantic Cement had to purchase if it wanted to\nstay in business, had every right in the world to set whatever price\nthey wanted.  There isn't, or at least shouldn't be, any law that says\nthat you have to be a nice guy in your private business dealings.\n\nYou go on to say: "The plant would never have been shut down -- the\nplaintiff's lawyers would have just negotiated a windfall settlement,\nbecause the plaintiffs would prefer an amount greater than $185K to\nhaving the plant shut down, while the plant would prefer any amount less\nthan the value of the plant to have the plant continue in operation."\n\nIf so, so what?  Since when are the courts supposed to be in the\nbusiness of preventing parties from reaping windfall settlements from\nother parties when those settlements arise from wrongful acts by those\nother parties?  If Atlantic Cement didn't want to have to face a choice\nbetween paying a windfall settlement or going out of business, well,\nshouldn't Atlantic Cement have thought of that before going _into_\nbusiness?  (I note that as far as the facts show Boomer et al were _not_\nthe parties responsible for bringing about this situation -- that was\nAtlantic Cement's own fault for choosing to build and operate the type\nof plant they did where and when they did.)\n\nAnd then you say: "Everyone's property rights were protected; the\nplaintiffs were made whole; unnecessary settlement costs were avoided."\nAs above, I dispute your claim that the plaintiffs were "made whole."\nThey were, in fact, by court action deprived of their rights as owners\nof property to choose to sell or not sell that property at a price\nacceptable to them.  And for that deprivation they were _not_ made\nwhole.  And again I ask: Since when are the courts supposed to be in the\nbusiness of ensuring that "unnecessary" settlement costs are avoided?\n(If so, I've been miseducated -- I always thought that the courts were\nsupposed to be in the business of ensuring that justice is done.)\n\n\n(1) _Boomer_ is not being taught as "infamous," at least not at my\nschool.\n\n(Aside: Northeastern Law usually does a very good job of hiring for\ntheir first-year, mandatory classes (such as Torts, where I first\nencountered _Boomer_) instructors who, regardless of their personal\nopinions, can and do teach the law neutrally.  When the students get\ninto their second and third years, in which the students (a) can pick\nand choose which courses to take (except for the mandatory Professional\nResponsibility, of course) and (b) are presumed to be a bit more worldly\nand self-confident, less likely to be consciously or sub-consciously\nintimidated by Law School Professors and able to learn from openly\nbiased instructors rather than be indoctrinated by them, the instructors\ntend to be more open in expressing their own opinions.  This is\nespecially true of part-time instructors who, in real life, are\npracticing attorneys or sitting judges... this can be _very_\neducational, sometimes far more so than being taught by a somewhat\ncloistered scholar.  End of aside.)\n\nI called it infamous because that's my opinion of it.  For the reasons\nI've stated above, I believe it to be a triumph of something that I can\nonly call "economic correctness" over justice.\n\n(2) It is "completely sensible" only if you believe that the alleged\nright of the owners of Atlantic Cement to stay in business and avoid\nlosing a lot of their own money due to their own wrongful act, and\nthe alleged right of several hundred Atlantic Cement employees to\nnot have their jobs disappear, should trump the rights of people who\nown property which was damaged by Atlantic Cement's wrongful acts.\n(And if you believe that it is correct for the courts (or any other\nbranch of government) to grant to private parties the right to take\nother people's property by eminent domain.)\n\n\nReally?  I didn't know that... what, if anything, has he had to say\nabout cases like _Boomer_?\n\n\nI've admitted that my understanding of the field generally referred to\nas "law and economics" is weak.  If it advocates the use of economical\nanalysis as one of many "tie-breaker" factors which courts may use to\nhelp them reach decisions in cases in which the dispute, as measured by\nthe scale of "justice", is evenly balanced, fine.  But as illustrated by\n_Boomer_, it is _not_ fine when the courts start viewing the economics\nof a case as being more important than the justice of a case.

From: New Liberation News Service <nlns>\nSubject: NLNS: Fascism with a Friendly Face\n\n/* Written  8:33 pm  Apr 14, 1993 by nlns@igc.apc.org in igc:nlns.news */\n/* ---------- "NLNS Packet 3.11 *** 4-14-93" ---------- */\n\nFascism with a Friendly Face: Does Rush Limbaugh Remind You of \nAnyone?\nDaevid Bornhuetter-Machen, The Madison Edge\n\n"The main difference between Adolf Hitler and Rush Limbaugh is that \nHitler was original and showed initiative." \n--Mort Sahl on The Tom Snyder Radio Show, ABC Radio Network, \nOctober 27, 1992.\n\n(NLNS)--Believe it or not, I was planning this comparative review of \nMein Kampf and Limbaugh's transcribed rant, The Way Things Ought to \nBe before Sahl issued his comparative review. As usual, Sahl's was \nindependent and sharp as a scalpel.\n	My effort can only dream of comparing favorably to Mort's. At \nleast it has a fairly popular orginating premise; everyone I'd mention the \nidea to thought it was either divinely inspired or at least past due for \ndelivery.\n	Those reactions are based on parallels that should be obvious to the \nmost peripheral observer of the Acts of those False Prophets. Both are \nnoted for their galvanizing oratorical skills, which they both used with \npassion to generate a political cult of massive numerical proportions (in \nfact, Limbaugh claims to have an audience of just over 12 million, almost \nidentical to the number of votes cast for Hitler in the April 1932 German \nelection). Both used a myopic social perspective to build the cult, and \nenthusiastically amputated facts from the record to fabricate their \nideological quilt.\n	The last point is glaringly documented by passages in the opening \npages of both books. Hitler's example is when, on page 5, he claims the \nGerman nationalist terrorist Leo Schlageter (he bombed part of a railway \nline between Dusseldorf and Duisburg, being caught in the act, in 1923) \nwas "betrayed to France by a representative of his government" when \nthere has never been any factual foundation for such a statement.\n	In fact, the governments of both the Reich and Prussia, as well as \nthe Vatican, actively intervened to save him from execution, and almost \nsucceeded. Limbaugh follows suit by making the hysterically sarcastic \nclaim in his introduction that "in a school or during a commencement \nceremony or many other public places... God is unconstitutional." Of \ncourse, it's not God but the official imposition of particular concepts of \nGod against an individual's will that's unconstitutional. But Limbaugh is \ntoo gleeful in his talent for distortion to want you to know that.\n	Of course, one would assume that, by comparing the two books, \nmy main point would be that The Way Things Ought to Be is the modern \nAmerican Mein Kampf. Not really. At the time of the first German version \nof Mein Kampf, Hitler was just four months out of prison (June, 1925), \nand trying to reorganize the Nazis. He used the book to build his dozen \nmillion followers. Limbaugh, on the other hand, came up with his book \nafter building his dozen million. Twelve million went a longer way in \nWeimar Germany that it does in the Republicrat United States.\n	Thus, the more accurate parallels would be that Limbaugh's daily \nthree-hour radio show is the American Mein Kampf, the primary \npropoganda tool used to pump up the angry volume; and that The Way \nThings Ought to Be is actually the American Triumph of the Will, a \ntranslation of the same fascist message into a different medium. Also, the \nprinted word was the more important medium in Weimar Germany, since \nradio was still being thought of by impoverished Germans as a medium of \nluxury in 1925. Today, on the other hand, Americans are more likely to \nspend a few seconds to tune a radio dial at no monetary charge than drop \n$22 for 304 pages of transcripts of the same words.\n	But, as Mort Sahl also observed on the radio the other night, some \ncloutmeister of the radical right wants Limbaugh to be a focal point of \ntheir propoganda. (And remember, Sahl is an Al Haig conservative these \ndays.)\n	Mort might not know exactly who Rush's equivalent of Rodolf \nHess is (the book itself suggests Ed McLaughlin, the former president of \nABC radio and now Limbaugh's partner in EFM Media, the radio \nprogram's production company). But Mort himself is a veteran of the talk \nshow, having hosted them in New York, Washington and Los Angeles. He \nknows what evil lurks in the hearts of major market media men. He knows \nthat Limbaugh could not have collected his audience had not the \nopportunity been placed on a silver platter and handed to him. Limbaugh \nearns his money just as honestly as Al Capone did; it's almost worthy of a \nRICO indictment.\n	On questions of social issues, there is an overabundance of \nmaterial in the Limbaugh book that seems to echo Hitler's venom. For \nexample:\n\nOn Their Own Qualifications to Control Society\n	Hitler: "Out of the host of sometimes millions of people, who \nindividually more or less clearly and distinctly guess the truth, partly \nperhaps understand it, one man [author's emphasis] must step forward in \norder to form, with apodeictic force, out of the wavering world of \nimagination of the great masses, granite principles, and to take up the fight \nfor their sole correctness, until out of the playing waves of a free world of \nthought a brazen rock of uniform combination of form and will arises" \n(page 577).\n	Limbaugh: "Who needs the media when they've got me? ... The \nshow is devoted exclusively to what I think ... [the phrase "with half my \nbrain tied behind my back to make it even"] denotes the egress of mental \naptitude I require to engage and demolish liberals and others who disagree \nwith me ... It might take four or five years, but I'm convinced The Media \nwill slowly and reluctantly come around to my way of thinking, kicking \nand screaming all the way." (pages 266, 21, 299 and 273, respectively.)\n\nOn Religion as the Basis of a Nation\n	Hitler: "In this world human culture and civilization are \ninseperably bound up with the existence of the Aryan. His dying-off or his \ndecline would again lower upon this earth the dark veils of a time without \nculture ... He who dares to lay hand upon the highest image of the Lord \nsins against the benevolent Creator of this miracle and helps in the \nexpulsion from Paradise." (Page 581.)\n	Limbaugh: "America was founded as a Judeo-Christian country ... \nBut our intellectual and political elites are often either hostile or \nambivalent toward religion ... People for whom belief in God is at best a \ncharming superstition have managed to ban prayer from the public schools \nfor the last thirty years. Is it only a coincidence that the quality of \nAmerican education has declined ever since?" (pages 274-5.)\n\nOn Popular Culture as a Reason for Social Collapse\n	Hitler: "The fight against the poisoning of the soul has to set in ... \nOne has only to look at the menus of our movie houses, vaudevilles and \ntheatres; and one can hardly deny that this is not the right kind of food ... \nTheatre, art, literature, movies, the press, billposters and window displays \nmust be cleaned of the symptoms of a rotting world and put into the \nservice of a moral idea of State and culture." (pages 346 and 348.)\n	Limbaugh: "Today, Hollywood is in trouble. The reason [is] that \nHollywood has forgotten who its audience is ... They make fun of people \nwho believe in God. They ridicule the traditional family, heterosexuality \nand monagamy. They disparage American heroes." (page 254.)\n\nOn the News Meida\n	Hitler: "The activity of the so-called liberal press was the work of \ngravediggers for the German people and the German Reich. One can pass \nby in silence the Marxist papers of lies ... it's task is only to break the \npeople's folkish and national spine, in order to make it ripe for the yoke of \nslavery of international capital and its masters, the Jews." (Page 331.)\n	Limbaugh: "Elements of The Media have jumped on the \nbandwagon of leftist causes. The cynical journalist of the past has been \nreplaced in many cases by an enthusiastic cheerleader for causes ... During \nthe Gulf war, CNN correspondent Bernard Shaw [said] CNN is a global \nnetwork. We can't take sides. Cant take sides? --- --- ---! ... If they don't \nrealize that their freedom lies in the United States of America and that \ntherefore they should defend this nation, they are hopelessly misguided \nand, may I suggest, flirting with megalomania." (pages 270 and 268.)\n\n*     *     *\n	\nTo continue these comparative excerpts is certainly possible, but \nultimately too depressing to take in one reading.\n	After putting these books down, there is one undeniable fact that \nhaunts me. In the 1920s, Adolf Hitler fed depressed and frightened \nGermans the opiate of hatred of those around them; in turn, it allowed \nGermans to hand their collective national power to the Nazis. In the 1990s, \nRush Limbaugh is doing the very same thing: distributing hatred to \ndepressed and frightened Americans; in turn, it is helping the American \nradical right to maintain its power base as the 12-year nightmare of the \nReagan-Bush era comes to an end, hoping to rebuild it into their hopes for \nThe Fascist States of America.\n	And if Limbaugh is not as repellant a Hitler, it is only because the \nradical right utilizes Limbaugh as its own gateway opiate. One can only \nwonder what the ultimate drug is they plan to hook America on.\n\nThe Madison Edge can be reached at PO Box 845, Madison, WI 53701-\n0845; (608) 255-4460.
The difference in the litigation environment is reflected in the fees.\n\nLack of defensive medicine and near-absence of malpractice is really\nwhy we spend less using the most expensive approach of pure insurance\nin Canada (along with France and Germany) without HMO's --- the NYT\nhas admitted that malpractice insurance fees are an order of magnitude\nlower in Canada but doctors take-home pay is almost equal to American\ndoctors; also, minimal bureaucracy 'cos the system is so-o-o simple\n(early March).\n\nPart of the deal for using the all-insurance approach like the French\nand Germans do (hey, why don't they criticize France and Germany?  Is\nit because too many people take French and German in college to make\nthe accusations stick? (-;) was to preserve the doctors independance.\nSince the provincial wings of the CMA are the ones that go to bat when\nthe fee schedule hikes are presented, the politically-bent doctors\nwere just cackling when they realized the CMA would grow in strength\nrather than diminish, especially when unopposed unlike in socialized\nmedicine approaches like Britain's National Health Service.\n\n\nFor non-life threatening things, market arguments adequately cover why\ncertain procedures are in scarcer demand.  I have MD friends who can't\nmake a living as specialists back in Manitoba not due to the insurance\nrates but because they won't get enough customers -- the CMA medical\nmonopoly's grip on doctors licencing (as in the US) aside -- so they\nmust move to larger places.  However, this does not refute debunking\nof waiting lines for urgent AND routine care, as has been done in the\nU.S. by Consumers Reports, health policy studies cited by Prof. Dennis\nE. Shea on USENET, CNN, NYT, etc.\n\nDoug Fierro has posted a NYT article from 3 weeks ago about Canada's\nhealth insurance approach, on Talk.politics.medicine.  There is one\nsmall error in the article: not all of our hospitals are private.\n\n\nOf course, the one thing to note is that in the Canada/France/Germany\ncase, private insurance *offloaded* the basic coverage to the public\nsector.  They realized they were keeping low-risk/high-profit extra\ninsurance for things like private/semi-private rooms (vs. ward\naccomodation), dental, glasses, etc. for corporate or personal\nbenefits, they'll have nothing to do with you if you want to be\ncovered for basic care.\n\nAt that point, they wouldn't even consider a "voucher" approach\nto broker the universal coverage and sell policies to make up\nthe difference in the federal guidelines and market stuff.\n\n\nIt is "free" in that there are no deductibles nor copayments (two\nthings which I advocate to make the Canadian insurance look more like\nreal health insurance -- which actually it is).  I know that when\nworking in Alberta, Ontario and Quebec, I was aware that I was paying\nfor health insurance - e.g., in Toronto, OHIP fees were listed on my\npay stub; Manitoba did not collect at paycheque time, but only\nannually at income tax time (built into the tax rate).  Only fiscal\nnaifs will proclaim that it's free, along with the Canadian Left for\nthat is part of their brainwashing agenda.\n\nThe French do have copayments, though.  France Magazine's Summer \n1992 edition has a fantastic presentation of their basic insurance\ncoverage, including a sample chart of copayment percentages.  For \n1-30 days, you're covered for 80% of the public hospital rate, 100%\nafterward.  With extra private insurance, you can get into a private\nhospital and be covered for any differences beyond the public hospital\nrate.  The public insurance covers 100% beyond 30 days, or the same\ncash amount for a private hospital and the difference is paid\nout-of-pocket or according to your supplementary private insurance.\nOver 2/3rds of French have some form of extra private insurance.  So,\nthe other 30% of health costs in Europe are out of private funds, not\ngleaned from other taxes.  The GDP figures are combined public and\nprivate expenditures for total outlay using the same methods that\nyield the 13-14% figure for the U.S.\n\n\nHealth insurance does exist in Canada and in Western Europe, its\njust that it doesn't cover basic care.  You can opt out in Canada\nand Germany, but you'll have to go uninsured as a result because\nthere are too few other people that do so --- i.e., no market.\n\nWhen private insurance realized how much money they'd make without the\nrisks involved in basic insurance (e.g., neurosurgery) versus deluxe\namenities (e.g., having to call Granada TV to replace a rental set on\nthe fritz in someone's private hospital room), they started to pat\nthemselves on the back for their social responsibility.  In Quebec\nlast spring, a consortium of private insurers publicly warned against\nany thoughts of privatizing routine, low cost parts of that province's\npublic health insurance plan.\n\ngld
I did hear this question asked during a radio news update of the case.  (They\nwere talking about the ongoing trial and had some audio clips).  Immediately\nafter the defense attorney asked the question, there was an "Objection!" heard\nin the background.  The clip ended at that point so I don't know if the\nobjection was upheld.  I can't imagine NC is *that* bad. \n\nThis I didn't hear as an audio clip but heard it reported a number of times on\nnews stories both during and after the trial.  Now the "we did it on purpose"\nthing is stretching, I think it was something more like--he had it coming.  If\nsomebody else remebers better than I on this second point, feel free to\nclarify.  \n        \nFrank\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFrank R.

(and part of the reason some of us believe weapons should\nbe available.)\n\n\n       We are not arguing the absolute sanctity of the U.S.\nConstitution.  In fact, the fillibuster we're talking about isn't\n*in* the Constitution.  I objected to your suggestion that the Senate\nwasn't intended to exercise the power it was clearly given.\n\n\n       I'll point out again that Reagan only had a Republican Majority\nin the Senate during his first term, and his coalition in the House\ncame apart at about the same time.  Bush never had any real support in\nCongress.\n\n       The real point is that everybody, *everywhere* got their pork,\nfrom the big corporations to the guy I saw last night leaving a\nconvenience store with an armful of junk-food he'd bought with\nfood stamps.  (He spent more in food stamps on junk than I *make* in a week\nand I'm not on government assitance.)\n\n\n       Lessee, let's pull out the old Almanac.\n\n       In 1980, total U.S. government budget outlays were 590.9 billion\ndollars.  In 1992 (est) they were 1.4754 trillion dollars, an increase of\napprox. 884 billion dollars.\n\n       In 1980, National Defense cost 133.9 billion dollars.  In\n192 it was 307 billion dollars, and increase of 174 billion dollars.\nThat leaves an increase of 710 billion dollars unaccounted\nfor.  (This represented an increase of 230%)\n\n       In 1980, Income Security (which includes retirement programs,\nHousing Assitance, and unemployment benefits, and I believe welfare)\ncost 86.5 billion dollars.  In 1992 it was 198 billion dollars, or\nmore than national defense started.  (This represented an increase\nof 230%)\n\n       In 1980, the Federal Government spent 32 billion dollars on\nMedicare.  In 1992 they spent 118 billion dollars.  (an increase of\n368%)\n\n       In 1980, the Feds spent 9 billion dollars on housing\ncredits and subsidies of that like.  In 1992 it was 87 billion.\n\n       In 1980, Health care services and research was 23 billion\ndollars.  In 1992, it was 94 billion dollars.\n\n       Agriculture, up 9 billion to 17 billion.\n\n       Science, up 11 billion to 16 billion.\n\n       Resource conservation up 7 billion to 20 billion.\n\n       Education up 14 billion to 45 billion.\n\n       Veteran benefits up 12 billion to 33 billion.\n\n       Trasnportation up 13 billion to 34 billion.\n     \n       About the only things I see which was seriously decreased was under \nthe Energy category, primarily under "Supply," and "Community Development,"\nin the area of "disaster relief," and between the two of them\nrepresent a loss of less than 11 billion dollars.\n\n       Where *was* this huge diversion?\n\n\n       Not that's a stretch.  If the current government was pushed by\nthe President to create this mess, wouldn't one expect it to begin to\nequalize once the pressure is gone?\n\n\n       Only assuming that the new role is a positive role we want\nto continue. I see very little positive about it.\n\n\n       The Constitution was *designed* to frustrate the democratic\nprocess, so that the voters could be absolutely sure they were getting\nwhat they wanted by the time it happened.  Nor do I see putting the\nbrakes on the "democratic process" an inherently bad thing.  Califronia's\nriding the edge and every time they pull their ballot initiative nonsense\nit gets worse.\n\n\n       Sometimes, or perhaps most of the time, the people should be\ntold, "no," and pointed to their local government.       \n\n\n       Phill, would you do me the very great favor of repeating that\nin talk.politics.guns?\n\n\n       Cute.  We can eliminate violations of the law by eliminating\nthe law.\n\n\n       Free speech alone is dangerous, Phill.\n\n\n       OK, Phill.  All you gotta show me is a clear pattern of\n*reduction* in homicide rates across several countries and that'll\nbe it.  (Not current, mind, you, reduction.)\n\n\n\n        Who's chaining anything to freedom of speech?  By *calling*\nit a freedom?  \n\n\n       Phill, you're a master of subtly changing the subject.  I haven't\n*based* my argument against raw democracy on the Constitution.  I've\ntried to explain why it isn't a good idea.  The only time I've referred\nto the Constitution is to point out it doesn't contain the restrictions\non the veto and the Senate you appear to believe were "meant," but\njust didn't make it in there.\n     \n       The Constitution doesn't *contain* the 41% fillibuster rule.\nI only believe that the rule is a good idea.  You cn't dismiss that\nas venerating the Constitution because it isn't *in* the Constitution.
What suburban kid would want to hold down a minimum wage job when there is so\nmuch more money to be made dealing drugs?\n\nYet, somehow, surburban kids do hold down minimum wage jobs.  So do inner\ncity kids, when give the chance.  Any reason you think that inner city kids\nare incapable of doing legitimate work?
The tax protesters are legally correct, but they are put in jail anyway.\n\nThe weakness of the governments legal position is shown by the fact that when\nsomeone protesting tax or gun laws on legal grounds gets a federal jury trial\n(very rare) the feds blatantly stack the jury, with the same old faces turning\nup time after time.\n\nHowever Teel should have mentioned that though his advice is legally sound, if\nyou follow it you will probably wind up in jail.

The economic and political ignorance of most Americans can be truly scary.\nPrice controls and government intervention.  The surest route to\ndisaster.  It's amazing, people never seem to learn from history (or\ncommon sense).  Price controls do not, and cannot work.  I would have\nthought our last experiment in the 70's would have been enough to \ndampen the belief that price controls can actually work.  As for\ngovernment intervention, people never seem to get the irony of what\nthe are saying.  We are told that entitlements are the biggest portion\nof the budget and they must be 'controlled'.  We are presented with\nhorror stories of waste and fraud in almost all government agencies.\nWe are shown stories about the miserable treatment our veterans get\nin our government run hospitals.  We are just now seeing stories about\nhow Social Security isn't going to cut it in the future (as if that\nshould come as any surprise).  And yet, people choose to ignore all\nof that and believe in the fairy tale of the government coming to\nthe rescue.  Simply amazing.
------------------------------\nWrong, if a bunch of faggots from the tenderloin decide to go straight\nbashing and they selectively target a heterosexual man and beat the bloody\nfuck out of him, they would get charged as well under all the federal laws\nthat exist about violation of civils rights. The focus of their intent is\nhis sexual orientation, and so the law applies to them as well. The\nnational government retains the right to make any laws necessary to\nsufficiently deter and punish any crime against someone's civil rights\nuntil that behavior becomes so well punished that nobody even tries it!\nThe fact is, that at last count, gays were not beating straights for their\nsexual orientation. Thus, the law is getting applied only to the straights\nwho indulge themselves. The federal government or judiciary has the right\nto enforce the 14th amendment guarantee of equal protection under law even\nif it takes 1000 possible charges against people who would violate them. Go\nread your constitutional law. We broke the back of the KKK's harrassment\ncampaign with the same strategy in the early 1900's. So many went to jail\nand for so long that it cut the heart out of the KKK. \n-RSW\n\n----------------------------------------\nThis "mutation" as you call it, protects your little butt too, if you\nhappen to be somewhere where you're the wrong "shade" for somebody else's\ntaste. If it can be shown that the motive for the assault on you was\nracially motivated, then the full power of these extra laws that bring more\ncharges and punishments will come against those who harmed you. The first\nuse of such laws was well over a hundred years ago, and constitutional\nscholars of all conviction recognize that this right reserved to the\nfederal government is well established and not just some short-lived\npeculiarity, too! Go read some constitutional law for awhile. Maybe you'll\nget it.\n-RSW\n\n--------------------------
And the religious right worships engines, smokestacks, landfills,\nand hates people.\n\nWhat does this name-calling have to do with anything you are claiming about\nthe truth of environmental disaster?  Nothing that I have read in this\nthread, nor heard from anyone I have talked to, would suggest to me that \npeople fit the definition you give of the religious left.  Come off it, Phil.\nA prime motivation for protecting our environment is so that we, \npeople, can continue to live in it healthily.  We just disagree on what\nis necessary to maintaining a healthy environment FOR PEOPLE.\n\n\n      [Russ's response deleted to save space]\n\n      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nWhat!?

As one of the "Clintonites" cited above, I'll try to clarify since this\nis not a case of Clinton's "dishonesty." (I won't necessarily defend him\non other issues.)  \n\nThere were NEVER any specific projects included in the Community\nDevelopment Block Grant portion of the President's proposal.  Congressional\nRepublicans, in an effort to discredit the stimulus package, selected what\nthey felt were silly sounding projects from a wish-list of POTENTIAL \nprojects prepared by the US Mayors' Conference before the stimulus package\nwas ever proposed.  (The document in question was designed to pressure the\nWhite House to increase the size of the block grant proposal submitted\nto Congress.  It didn't work.)\n\nThe $2.56(?) billion proposed in the stimulus package came nowhere close\nto covering the total estimated cost of the original wish-list.  If it\nwere passed, communities would have to select which projects to fund and\nat what level.\n\nIn the case of Spokane, Wa., Tom Foley's home district, no one ever\nexpected to be able to refurbish a local swimming pool (one of the \nRepublicans' examples) FROM THE FUNDS AVAILABLE IN THE STIMULUS\nPACKAGE since the estimated cost of doing so exceeded the total \namount of block grant funds the city would receive from the stimulus \npackage for ALL projects.  \n\nThe plan, instead, was to use the money on public housing construction\nand remodeling to cope with a severe housing shortage.  (Yup, there are\nplaces where that is true.)  The swimming pool improvements were near the\nbottom of a long list of priorities prepared by the city.  The $3 million\nor so to be received would cover only a few of the most pressing\npriorities.\n\nIf the block grants are cut from the stimulus package, it is these projects\nthat will be affected by the lack of funds.  And that is why the Clinton\nadministration has been publicizing the issue.\n\nA final point.  One may or may not like community block grants.  It is\nworth noting, however, that Congressional Republicans' opposition to them\nis new.  Since the Nixon administration, Republicans have generally \nsupported such grants as an alternative to targeted federal spending,\narguing that local governments are far better able to determine spending\npriorities than "Washington bureaucrats."  \n\nIs it clear now?  Or is this all too complicated to understand?\n\njsh
# # I thought I was clear.  Because homosexuals support laws to force\n# # employment of homosexuals against the will of some employers, they\n# # are attempting to interfere with private acts between mutually consenting\n# # adults.\n# \n#    Ok, I'll leave others to discuss your use of statistics, but I think I'm\n# able to discuss liberterian ideas.\n#    The ideas are good. They seek to maximise individual rights by keeping\n# governments out of transactions between consenting adults. If an employer wants\n# to discriminate against a group, she/he should be allowed to to maximise their\n# freedom. The discriminatees can go elsewhere.\n#    Unfortunately, it doesn't relate to maximising total individual rights\n# within a community. If an employer or shopkeeper or whatever can discriminate\n# in this way, then the freedom of the discriminatee goes down. Because people do\n# not live in perfect economic conditions, with perfect mobility, unlimited\n# numbers of potential employers of their skills, unlimited places to buy goods,\n# the liberterian argument leads to a *decrease* in the amount of liberty in the\n# community. \n\nYou mean, if a large part of the population supports discrimination \nagainst homosexuals, they will be injured.  But if a large part of the\npopulation supports such discrimination, how did that law get passed?\n\n# Tony Quirke, Wellington, New Zealand. Quirke_a@kosmos.wcc.govt.nz
[In response to a report by CBN News correspondent Ken Lormond about a\nmeeting between Slick Willie and homosexual activists:]\n\nLormond: "But Clinton will not be attending a rally by homosexuals in\nWashington later this month.

Once more around the racetrack. See the original statement that it is\nnonsense to believe that you cannot legislate morality. I simply stated\nthat they can pass all the laws they want but not a single one of them\nwill make you or I more moral people. They may make us act in a moral\nmanner, but our actions are only a reflection of the unwillingness to\nrisk punishment. They say nothing about whether we have become more\nmoral or not. Perhaps the distinction is too fine.\n\n\n\n\nTOG

It would if malpractice and "defensive medicine" were the main\nfactors in explaining spiralling US health care costs, but they aren't.\n\nAlthough Gary is correct in noting that malpractice-related problems are\ngreater in the US than Canada, they by no means account for the overall\ndifference in health care costs.  (They do account for a somewhat larger\nportion of the difference in physicians' gross income in the two countries.)\n\nSome facts.  Malpractice insurance and awards account for less than 1% of\ntotal health care costs in the US.  In 1991, according to a survey of \nphysicians conducted by a national medical journal physicians averaged\npaying 3.7% of their practice receipts in malpractice insurance.  \nMalpractice insurance premiums and malpractice awards peaked in 1985;\nthey've declined significantly since then.  At the same time, health\ncare costs have increased more than any period in history.\n\nAs far as "defensive medicine" is concerned, the AMA estimates that its\ntotal impact is about $7 billion per year.  That's about 8% of the total\ncurrent INCREASE in health care costs -- and the estimate is from a group\nthat could be expected to overestimate the impacts of defensive medicine\non health care.\n\nAs small a problem as this is in the overall scheme of things, however,\nClinton has been on record for a long time favoring an indemnification\nof MD's against malpractice suits if they follow procedures set by their\nspecialties.  This would eliminate most, if not all frivolous suits\nwhile retaining the ability to sue for true malpractice.\n\njsh
[of who else but President of the United States William Jefferson Clinton.]\n\nTsk. Surely you don't wish for the Democrats to destroy our beloved country\njust so your party can get some trivial political advantage? That's rather\na petty way to think. (Not that this pettiness doesn't extend all the way\nto the U.S. Senate, I've noticed...)\n\nWhile Bush was president, I kept hoping and praying that he'd wise up. I\ncouldn't stand the man, but I wish he'd done a decent job; if so, we might\nnot be in the mess we are now, and that would be a small price to pay for\nsuffering through another term of Republican control. Similarily, YOU should\nbe hoping and praying that Clinton does a good job. Even if you're certain\nhe won't.
There are a couple of ways to look at them.  One is, "We want\nyou to support this Constitution, so we'll say anything that we think\nwill appeal to you," or the more straightforward, "This is why we think\nwhat we've suggested in this Constitution is a good idea."\n\n       You clearly consider the former to be the primary situation.\n\n\n       Well, I know Hamilton was a dyed in the wool monarchist, and \nprobably the authoritarian extreme to Jefferson's democratic impules.\nBut what would you suggest as a means of determining their opinions\non the government if we don't consider what they wrote about the\ngovernment?\n\n       And is writing in support of something automatically "propoganda"\nto the point we must assume it is untrue or that they are saying what\nthey don't believe?\n\n\n       If the Senate was less powerful than the House of Lords, than\nwe'd almost have to state that the House of Representatives was also.\n(In fact, they both were, because the British government had much\ngreater power than did the American system).       \n\n\n       I disagree.  The system is not too slow, it was simply designed to\nhandle less than it has demanded that it handle.  As somebody in Washington\nput it (whose name I forget), "Congress has become everybody's city\ncouncil."\n\n       Congress is more than capable of quick action, and has more than\nenough power and time on its hands, if it confined itself to what its\noriginal jurisidiction was and allowed more local autonomy.\n\n       It is not a case of the system of government they created failing,\nbut that it is operating under a set of conditions they specifically\nwanted to avoid.  Namely, a concentration of power.  It would seem\nthen that the proper thing to do is not to reduce the power of either\nHouse in some attempt to grease the wheels.  All you'll get then is\na system which moves quicker to do stupid things.  It would make more\nsense to make more decisions at a local level.\n\n\n       Please explain to me how Bush abused the veto in an "extraordinary"\nmanner.\n\n\n       I fail to see where any restrictions, implied or otherwise, were\nplaced on the veto.  It could just as easily have been read as a means\nto put a check on democratically popular but unwise (in the executive's\nopinion) policies.  \n\n       There is no limit in the Constitution to the President's veto power\nregarding what a bill is for.  Previous Presidents have used the veto\nfor any number of reasons, most usually having something to do with their\nagenda.  I am really curious how you single Bush out as *the* President\nwho abused vetos.\n\n\n       Why is it not a reasonable restriction?  Because 51 Senators\nis the magic holy number upon which Laws must be based?  If 41 Senators\nfeel safe enough with their state constituencies to stand up and \nfillibuster isn't that *enough* to indicate there's a sufficient question\nas to whether a law is a good idea or not to re-evaluate it?\n\n       Why one earth *should* 51% be sufficient to enact a law which\ncovers 250 million people in very, very diverse places and living\nin radically different conditions?  Why *shouldn't* a super-majority\nbe required?\n\n       Any system in which the simple majority is given absolute power\nto ignore the minority then the minority *will* be ignored.  I do not\nsee this as a positive thing.  And for all that I'm sure the Republicans\nare looking for pork as much as the Democrats, they've got some legitimate\nobjections to the legislation in question.
... an amazing illustration of disconnection from reality.\n\nGlad to see that you agree that the current Government is reticent\nabout admitting the sovereignty of the people!  Speaking from personal\nexperience, I have had judges illegally assume jurisdiction even after\nI demanded that the DA prove such jurisdiction on the record, and the\nDA stood mute.  I have also had an appellate court uphold such action\nand hide behind California Rules of Court, Rule 106 ("The judges of\nthe appellate department shall not be required to write opinions in\nany cases decided by them, but may do so whenever they deem it\nadvisable or in the public interest.").  That is reality, I agree.

I'm not sure why you don't consider it an option.  No one suggests that\nsuch analysis should be left to "regulators."  In fact, the "re-inventing\ngovernment" movement provides just such a cost/benefit approach to the\nanalysis of public spending.  Libertarians would do well to learn more\nabout it. \n\n\nSorry, but it strikes me that it is the only "feasible" approach.  What is\nnot feasible is a wholesale attack on all government regulation and \nlicensing that treats cutting hair and practicing medicine as equivalent\ntasks.\n\n\nActually, the only areas of public spending above that strike me as \ngenerating substantial support among libertarians are police and defense.\n(It is an interesting aside that as committed as libertarians claim to\nbe to a principle of non-coercion, the only areas of public spending\nthat they frequently support involve hiring people with guns....hmmm...)\n\n\nPerhaps you have.  May I suggest that you consider that revolutionaries\nfrequently generate support by acting as protectors of "geezers," \nmothers and children.  Governments that ignore such people on the grounds\nthat "we don't have much to fear" from them do so at their own peril.\n\njsh

[ These two paragraphs are from two different posts.  In splicing them \n  together it is not my intention to change Steve's meaning or misrepresent\n  him in any way.  I don't *think* I've done so. ]\n\n\nPart of what started this was my earlier example of Illinois, USA requiring\nanyone doing more than X automobile transfers a year (X = 10, I think)\nto become licensed as a used car dealer.  In addition, it requirs anyone\nwith a used car dealer's license to own at least 10 cars at a time, all the\ntime. \n\nLet me continue with this example and try to answer Steve's questions.\n\nSteve, let's say you have the talent and inclination to fix up and resell\ncars.  Either you've gotten good enough at it in your spare time to bump\nup against these limits, or you would like to do it full-time but these\nstupid, arbitrary laws prevent you from starting out small and pulling\nyourself up.  So I'm protected from a hungry neighborhood competitor willing\nto take a low profit while working extra hard to fulfill my needs, and you're\nprotected from doing what you want with your life.\n\nHere's what I see libertarianism offering you:\n\nYour money is truly yours; it belongs to you.  You can use it to buy a car.\nIf you use it to buy a car, it is truly your car; it belongs to you.  You\ncan use your money to fix up that car.  Since it is your car, you can sell\nthat car.\n\nYour life is truly yours; it belongs to you.  It matters not if someone\nthinks that it's "wrong" for you to buy and sell 10 cars within 12 months\nrather than, say, 9 cars.  They may dissaprove, but it is not their life or\ntheir money, it is your life and your money.\n\nMy money is truly mine; it belongs to me.  I can use it to buy a car.\nPerhaps your car.  Perhaps that 10th car, the one that someone, somewhere\ndissaproves of you selling and, presumably, of me buying.\n\nThat someone could go to the government and insist that the government make\nus stop it.  But the government would be powerless to stop us from doing\nwhat we like with our own property, in the abscence of fraud or agression.\nAnd it would be powerless to stop us from associating with each other.\n\nThis does not seem to me to be a utopian dream, but basic human decency\nand common sense.  A real grass-roots example of freedom and liberty.\nAnd yes, not having a few people acting as our masters, approving or\nrejecting each of our basic transactions with each other, does strike me\nas a wonderful way to improve the human condition.

Wait a minute.  I agree with you that people have to take responsibility\nfor their own behavior (I assume that's what you meant by the word\n"account"), but also for "the behavior of their immediate community"?\n\nFirst of all, how "immediate" are you talking about, and secondly, I\nhave a lot of trouble with any theory of social behavior or justice\nwhich charges anyone with the duty of taking responsibility for or\naccounting for the actions of a different person...
"Women are only interested in clothes and shopping"\n   "Whites are imperialist colonial fascists"\n   "Blacks are lazy uneducated scum"\n   "Men are rapists"\n   "Homosexuals support child-molesting"\n\n   Slogans, my dear Cramer, are not an adequate substitute for thought.
And the reason that the Soviet Union couldn't achieve the ideal of pure\ncommunism was the hostility of surrounding capitalist nations...Uh huh.\nSomehow, this all sounds familiar.  Once again, utopian dreams are \nconfronted by the real world...
actually,  teh D means the registered driver has diplomatic immunity.\nThat means they can do as they damn well please on the roads, and you\nhave only God as your protection.   \n\nThe state Department Issues Saa-XXX  plates for personnel  who work\nat the embassies but haven't been granted  immunity.

I'm really surprised Clinton hasn't already tried to do this.  He seems\nto want to tackle other irrelevant issues first, so why not this one as well.\n\n\nWrong.  We need its capability.  Sure it has its problems, very few\nairplanes haven't, but getting rid of something we need is not the\nanswer.  What do you want to do, start over a rebuild a new airplane\nfrom scatch?  It'll have its problems as well and there will be calls\nagain, for it to be scrapped.  THe other option is to try to extend\nthe life of the C-5s and C-141s that are getting extremely old.\n\n\nIt'll cost jobs, but I'm for it.  We especially don't need a B-2.

From the Santa Rosa (Cal.) Press-Democrat, April 15, 1993, p. B2:\n\n    Male sex survey: Gay activity low\n\n    A new natonal study on male sexual behavior, the most thorough\n    examination of American men's sexual practices published since\n    the Kinsey report more than four decades ago, shows about 2\n    percent of the men surveyed had engaged in homosexual sex and\n    1 percent considered themselves exclusively homosexual.\n\n    The figures on homosexuality in the study released Wednesday\n    by the Alan Guttmacher Institute are significantly lower than\n    the 10 percent figure that has been part of the conventional\n    wisdom since it was published in the Kinsey report.\n\nThe article also contains numbers on the number of sexual partners.\nThe median number of sexual partners for all men 20-39 was 7.3.\nCompared to the table I have already posted from Masters, Johnson,\nand Kolodny showing male homosexual partners, it is apparent that\nhomosexual men are dramatically more promiscuous than the general\nmale population.  It's a shame that we don't have a breakdown for\nstraight men vs. gay/bi men -- that would show even more dramatically\nhow much more promiscuous gay/bi men are.

One of the commentators on one of the Big Three news programs \ndescribed the VAT (which ain't a sales tax) as a tax "government's love."\nI was even surprised he got the reason right:  it effectively hides the\nmajority of the tax the consumer has to pay *from* the consumer.  It's\nkind of like they do with cars.  You pay far more for automobile taxes than\nmost people realize because it's contained in two dozen different taxes,\neverything from your license to your tires to your gasoline.
You think that you all have it bad....here at good ol' Southwest Missouri\nState U., we have 2 parties running for student body president.

They campaigned by handing out condoms and listing\ntheir qualifications as,"I listen really well."  It makes me sick to have\na party established on many of the things that are ruining this country like\nthey are.  I think I'll run next year.:(

No one is questioning whether Mr. King is black.  The question arises\nwhether King's race should make police officers "afraid as hell."  Your\nstatement seems to imply that cops should have a different standard for\nlarge black guys than for just large guys in general.  \n\nThat two posts later you don't understand why anyone pointed out your use\nof the adjective is almost as informative as your original use.
You might -- except that gay men are MUCH more promiscuous than\nstraight men -- which shows how damaged and screwed up gay men are.
This is similar to my saying that Clinton's timber summit does little to\nfix the health care problem.  Look at the whole picture, not just\nrandomly picked libertarian positions.  If government is not allowed to\nuse "non-initiated force" to achieve its goals, than no special interest\ncan influence the government to use non-initiated force on their behalf.\n\nThe means to reaching such a restricted government is another topic\nwhich I'll address briefly.  It certainly won't happen until\nlibertarianism is the dominate philosophy.  What means do we have to\nmake libertarianism the dominate philosophy?  Statists run the education\nmonopoly, so we have to be creative.  The Advocates for Self-Government\nreports 85% of their Seminar 1 participants "embrace" libertarianism.\nThat's the best means I've seen yet.  We should lobby for compulsory\nSeminar 1 attendance. :) [in jest!]\n\nRoger Collins

: >True, man did not invent the need for food, shelter, warmth and the ilk,\n: >but man did invent the property laws and the laws of trespass.   \n: But how do you think property is generated ? Does it grow automatically\n: on trees when we wish so, or someone has to produce it ?\n\nSome say it was generated by God or Goddess; some say it was the result of\nthe coalescence of billions of tons of interstellar debris.  In either case,\nthe property of which Xavier speaks has been around for millions of years.\n\n\n:     It all follows from the fact that Mother Nature does not\n: provide us automatically with our needs,\n\nOh?  When did She *stop*?  Mother Nature has been automatically providing\nus with her bounty ever since we crawled out of the primordial ooze.  It\nis not "produced": it produces itself, year after year.  Last night, for\nexample, I saw four deer crossing the road (pretty sight, too); in an\nearlier time, one of them would have been dinner.\n\n: There are 2 ways to go with produced things: the first is to \n: _trade_ it with the the person(s) who produced it. \n: The other one is to take it with a gun from the person who produced\n: it. The first way is the civilized method, the second is how savages\n: arrange their affairs.\n\nThe American Indians had no concept of ownership of property, and often\nfreely gave of their supplies to neighboring tribes, trading food and\nclothing for weapons or services.  The Native Hawaiians, like their\nPolynesian ancestors, also could not conceive of that idea, and shared\nmany things with the other Islanders.  In fact, "hi'ipoi", the Hawaiian\nword for "cherish" means "sharing food".  The Great Mahele, in which\nthe Islands were divided up more-or-less evenly between the rich and\nthe poor, was a white man's idea.  In Africa, villagers will often\nshare tools, crops, and clothing with other members of their own village\nand neighboring villages.  Every anthropologist who has ever been to\nAfrica has at least one tale of the difficulties arising from the so-\ncalled "theft" of the scientists possessions -- two concepts of which,\nuntil the visitors came along, the natives had no understanding.\n\nThese are the people we call "savages".\n\nOn the other hand, car-jackings and muggings are up from last year.\n\nDov, before you make further comment on this thread, I think it would\nbehoove you to study *all* of the facts.

Horrors, appealing to popular principles.  Can we perhaps as the\nquestion of whether the Constitution might have been written to appeal\nto the principles, rather than, as you appear to believe, it was written\nwith something else in mind and "propoganda" put out by its supporters.\n\n       But let's be honest about something, here.  When was the last time\nyou brought up all the valid points against your own arguments?\n\n       Or are they simply propogranda?  We can't know what Phill *really*\nmeans because he's obviously using arguments designed to convince.\n\n\n       If they're true or false, regardles of why they were said, why\non earth did you make a point of calling them "propogranda?"  That\nwould seem to be irrelevent.\n\n\n       Oh, I have no argument with questioning them.  I don't believe\nthey no longer apply, but that's because I think most of them were\ngood arguments.  I'm not entirely happy about the situation, because\nthey were obviously only applied to a minority of the time, but I don't\nthink that alone is sufficient to invalidate them.\n\n\n       Since the U.S. constitution is the basis for the U.S. political\nsystem, most changes in it would require Constitutional change.  In this\nparticular case, however the fillibuster is a matter of procedure\nand tradition.  It only *should* have been made part of the Constitution. :-)\n\n\n        In principle no?  That they had less power of that they should have\nhad less power?\n\n\n        Phill, we're discusing the power of legislative houses.  While\nthe Prime Minister *is* member of Parliament, he is more analgous (although\nbadly) to the U.S. President.\n\n        Now, please explain to me how the U.S. House of Representatives\nis "in principle" more powerful than the House of Lords (or the Senate)\nbut in practice is less.  Are you suggesting that the writers of the\nConstitution *really* intended for them to be more powerful, but gosh\ndarn the thing was ratified before they realized they'd forgotten to put\nthose extra restrictions on the Senate in?\n\n\n      Not at all.  As any entry level political science course will tell\nyou, people who want laws implemented will always choose the level of\ngovernment to "attack" which presents them with the best chance of\ngetting what they want.  With national "interest groups" it is simply\na very rational thing to do to want the Federal government to enact a\nlaw rather than the states.  Less people to persuade, and less \n"contributions" to make.  \n\n      Why do those concerned about abortion primarily concentrate at\nthe Federal level?  Simply because if they win that battle all the little\nstate battlefields are won by extension.  The same extends to insurance,\nmedicine, and most other questions.\n\n      Local government has not "failed" in that it hasn't done what it\nshould, but that it is dominated by local interests.  Thus non-local\ninterests who want localities to abide by their rules can't get their\nrules past the local government.  Thus, since they've got more clout,\nonly in the wrong place, they appeal to the next higher level because\nit can impose its will on the lower.\n\n      I mean, let's get real here.  Do we *really* need the Congres\nof the United States deciding that x traffice light should be on thus-\nand such pattern?  Or that *carjacking* needs to be a federal as opposed\nto a local crime?\n\n      The more people want the more Congress will take power to "sell"\nit to them for their votes.  I don't think the rise of "special interests"\nis coincidence with the increased power of Congress.\n\n\n       Bingo.  The higher up the governmental ladder the less actual\nneed matters, because political power can be concentrated at higher\nlevels, while people with less cloud only find themselves reduced to\nin effectiveness.\n\n\n       Then why not simply leave New York's education to New York?  I\nremain unconcinved that there is any state in the Union which is not capable\nof educating its own children if that's what they want to do.  And if\nyou leave it to them, you only have to worry about the "pork" in that\nstate.  And since industries can't concentrate their political power\nand wealth, rather they must divide it among the states to try and get\nwhat they want, individual voices have more relative impact.\n\n       The problem with the fillibuster is not that you must "buy off"\nstates, but that the Congress has acquired too much power to sell pork.\n\n\n       But why on earth should we want to redirect it?  You said yourself \nthat you have to sell pork to get things through Congress.  If Congres\nhas less authority to sell pork and retains its authority to enact\nnational legislation within its granted jurisdiction, the pork problem\nis significantly reduced.\n\n\n       The current blocks essentially state that inaction is preferable\nto action, thus it the system is weighted against action.  Considering\nthe government the usually the institution with the sole power to\nenforce its decisions by force, I consider bias against making those\ndecisions a good thing.\n\n\n       The difference with the lower pyramid is that a) they have\nmore legal, legitimate authority in most matters under our Constitution\nthan the federal government, and b) at those lower levels power is\nharder to concentrate.  And c) you get the benefit of not imposing\nnew deicisons on everybody at once.  You get to see them tried out\nwithout a national decision.  Congressional action usually treats the\nentire country as a whole, yet even with similar problems in different\nareas, different solutions may be called for.\n\n       And while I often don't agree with the decisions my local\nand state reps make, at least I have a better option of going to\nthe city council and shooting my mouth off.  I'd much rather the\nmajority of laws be made by accessible people who hang around and end\nup having to put up with them rather than somebody far off in\nWashington with half a million or more constituents.\n\n       I'm curious what you base your assumption that lower levels\nare more corrupt.  \n\n\n       Phill, *you* brought up the Federalist papers.  We were\narguing the fillibuster and whether or not a minority of Senators\nshould be allowed to hold up a bill.  You claimed the Senate was\nsuppose to be a far less powerful House, and I contended there was\nnothing in the Constitution or other writings which indicated this.\nWhich was when you brought up that we can't decide what the founders\nwanted based on the Federalist papers.  You argued against them,\nI never argued from them.  I have primarily referred to the Constitution,\nwhich places only very small restrictions on the Senate than for\nthe House.\n\n\n       The U.S. Constitution is a nuts-and-bolts document.  The Delcaration\nof Independence was the high-brow reasoning.  (There are a couple of other\nexamples, though, such as the reasoning for the power to tax, and the\nreasoning for the power to grant permits, both in Article I, Section 8.)\n\n\n       To a certain extend I do believe the veto has become something\nit wasn't intended.  However, I also believe it is inevitable considering\nthe Congress' own abuse of their power to make bills say whatever they\nwant them to say.  Unlike most people I think we shouldn't be worrying\nabout the veto, which is fine, but of the problem in Congress which\nalmost necessitates its abuse.\n\n\n       *BUSH?*  Phill, that's absurd.  Bush had *37* vetos, one of\nwhich was over-ridden.  Go read up on FDR if you think that's\nanything resembling a record.\n\n\n       Why not?  What is inherently wrong with biasing the system\nagainst action?  Historically governemnt action in the U.S. when\ndealing with issues with a bare minority and a large minority have\nnot been successful.  When you're in a position of imposing federal\npower on diverse people, why should the federal government not have to\ngot through something more than a bare majority\n\n\n       Now we're switching from a general question of a fillibuster\nto a specific bill.  I don't see how it make a difference.\n\n\n       Sure it's arguable.  Theyr'e *arguing* it.  However, requiring\n60% to bring it to a vote ensures that they'll have to have a *good*\nargument.  Something that isn't based solely on party lines.\n\n\n       No, I am completely happy with a system which requires a minority\nfor *action*.  Since U.S. history is a history of carving up population\ngroups and implementing piece-meal on minorities, I feel minorities\nshould have sufficent clout to prevent action they feel strongly enough\nabout.  And 41% is hardly a tiny minority.  I don't advocate the minority\nbeing capable of initiating actionm but I see no problem with biasing\nthe *federal* system against action.

AAAAAAAAAAAA!  RUN! RUN FOR YOUR LIVES!\n\n\n\nThen why are they in the process of systematically dismantling some of\ntheir socialistic health care systems through privitization of key components?\n\n\nIf I hold a gun to your wife, would you respond the same way? I don't\nthink so. While the age of aquarius may have hit the White House, the\nage of peace love and harmony hasn't hit in South Central LA nor has it\nhit in former Yugoslavia. And as long as there are people in the world\nwho would rather see me dead than thrive, I want the protection of a\npolice force who will keep the peace so I *can* make love without being\nshot.\n\n\nThe ultimate statement for equal rights (something many of the feminazis\nhave forgotten) is "I do not care if you are either a man or a woman,\nI do not care if you are black or white, I do not care if you are gay\nor straight." Once you can honistly say "I do not care about color,\nrace, or gender or sexual preference", then we will truly be on the\nright track.\n\nKeep shoving differences in my face and then expect us all to get along?\nGet real! So long as you try to make me care if you are black, female,\nor whatever, I am going to continue to balk. It's natural human behaviour.\n\nBut the moment employers searching for employees, banks looking to lend\nmoney, and theClinton administration looking for appointees can honistly\nsay "I do not care about your color, race, gender, or sexual preferences;\nI instend instead to treat you as a human being," crap like last year's\nriots will continue to happen.\n\n\nBarf.\n\nYou mean the same economic theorists who say things like "for the sake\nof convenience in mathematical modeling we will first assume there is\nno wealth creation" now get a crack at implementing their PhD thesis in\nreal life?\n\nGo back to your textbooks on macroeconomic theory. Look in the first chapter\nof that book, introducing the field of macroeconomic theory. Right there\nin chapter 1, section 1, is a statement like the following:\n\n	"As it is difficult to predict and model wealth creation,\n	especially in an economy where wealth creation is inherently\n	the province of individuals who create new inventions and\n	discover new ideas, we will assume for the rest of this\n	book that there is no wealth creation.\n\n	"We do not assume the lack of weath creation in the real world,\n	however the mathematical modeling of such an inherently\n	unpredictable subject is impossible. Even though we assume\n	no wealth creation, we do believe that for most mathematical\n	economic modeling such an assumption is reasonably valid\n	as it allows us to make predictions which then can be tested."\n\nSo the guys who are running the store for Clinton and company are now\nassuming that wealth creation does not exists. They are (borrowing an\nidea from the Hitchhiker's Guide) too advanced to think of these simple\nthings.\n\nTo be honist, I would rather have an engineer with years of experience\nbuilding bridges design the next bridge, rather than a theoretical\nphysicists with a freshly minted PhD and no experience do the same job.\n\n					- Bill Woody
I do read Av Week and don't remember this.  Could you supply the date\nof the magazine?  As for C-17 vs. C-5 , the C-17 can't carry as much\nbut has more capability ( read : can land at smaller airfields of which\nthere are more of ) than the C-5.  Now is the C-17 pork?  It depends\non whether your job relies on it or not.  :)  In California right now,\nI would say that it is not pork since due to peace dividend so many \npeople are out of work. \n\n\nHuh?  Shouldn't that read "The question is whether a social-pork happy\nLes Aspin and Clinton will be able to face down a jobs-pork happy\nCongress."
Not quite.  The answer is:  Many homosexuals, heterosexual, and bisexuals are,\nbut then, many are not.\n\n Or, more simply: Lots of people are.

Unless I've got my notes mixed up, 939 F.2d 499 comes close to this.\nRegular guy.  Blue-collar worker at a regular company.  Hauled into\ncourt.  Convicted.  Appeals to 7th circuit.

You're being too generous to the communists, I think.  In practice,\ncommunism has "solved" the problem by killing off anybody who is _too_\nproductive, and who therefore raises embarrassing questions about why the\nrest of the group is a bunch of sluggards.  The mass butchery of "kulaks"\nin the USSR is a good instance of this.\n    A poor second best is to have a neighboring capitalist country to which\npeople of politically incorrect skill and ambition flee.  I often wonder\njust what Castro would have done if the Cubans presently in Miami would\nhave been forced to remain in Cuba.  Would they have revolted and killed\nhim off, or been killed?\n    Best of all is to build a wall locking the citizens of your country in,\nload it up so heavily with attack dogs, barbed wire, and land mines that\nmost people fleeing over it die, and then give everyone the choice of\nobedience, prison, or flight.  This would be a bad science-fiction novel,\nif the East Germans hadn't actually done it.  The last person to die\ncrossing the wall, as I recall, was an unarmed woman who was shot in the\nback.  Erich Honecker was going to go on trial for that, but he fled to\nsocialists in Chile.\n    It's good to be kind to one's intellectual opponents, but sometimes\nit's a sheer waste of time.

...His account that is.\n\nMany important issues, and some not-so important ones, are discussed here\non the net on a daily basis.  I have just been informed of what I feel is\none of the most important things that we could ever discuss -- The \nout-and-out censorship of one of our fellow posters because some people\ndon't like what he says or thinks.\n\nWe have all seen the postings here by AJ Teel.  Although many of us have\nnot agreed with their content, I'm sure most of us have been at least\nsomewhat interested in them.  I, for one, am greatful to live (I thought)\nin a country where people like Mr. Teel are allowed to say what they please.\nIf I don't wan't to read it, I can just skip on by, or unsuscribe.  But,\nunfortunately, some people cannot let others live and let live.  They feel\nan overwhelming need to snuff out the little bastards.  Now it seems that\nMr. Teel will be with us no more, due mainly to our brother, and cheif\nnet police, Ted Frank.\n\n\nPLEASE HELP AJ TEEL REGAIN NET (POST) ACCESS AND CORRECT THIS INJUSTICE. \n\n                      ARE YOU ON TED'S HIT LIST?  \n                      ARE YOUR THOUGHTS CORRECT?  \n                        IS YOUR ACCOUNT SAFE?\n         HAS YOUR SYSADMIN BEEN CONTACTED BY THE THOUGHT POLICE?\n\nI thought the NLG and the ACLU supported people with diverse opinions. NOT!\n\n \nPlease read the following forwarded messages from AJ Teel so that \nyou may understand this vial act for what it is...\n\n------------------------------ forwarded ---------------------------------\n\nNewsgroups: alt.activism,alt.conspiracy,talk.politics.misc,misc.legal\nSubject: Officer Ted Frank, Thought Police Badge Number NWO-666\nSummary: Ted wins the argument by killing his opponent!\nExpires: \nDistribution: \nOrganization: University of Colorado, Boulder\nKeywords: NWO Ted Frank\n\nWell, well, well... Thanks to eck@panix.com (Mark Eckenwiler) and\nthf2@kimbark.uchicago.edu (Ted Frank), my account is to be axed.\nI guess that the information I am presenting is just toooo difficult\nfor them to deal with. They (ONLY Ted and Mark) have complained to my\nsysadmin some unknown number of times to get me off the net. (In his\ndefense, Mark sent only one message and it was not THAT bad; it has\nbeen posted in one of the newsgroups; However, it *was* not directed\nat me as would be common practice and I am VERY good at responding\nvia netmail...)\n\nWhile I disagree with Ted, I would not send mail to his sysadmin\nto get him axed. Name-calling was not enough; jumping on every post\nI made was not enough; ignoring specific points when they were not\nwhat the desired picture was not enough; SIMPLY IGNORING ME IF I\nAM SUCH A KOOK WAS NOT ENOUGH. Even now I do not wish to have him\naxed, but I do wish to express my disgust about this. "Argumentum\nad silence-your-opponent-um"?! I would have thought he would have\nwanted me to stay around just to have someone to yell about and\nseem sooo wise... (to himself, I think).\n\nThe issue that seems to be: "Is the following an advertisement?"\nApparently, Ted and Mark think so...\n\n1) I Posted an article from around one year ago as it was taken \n	*off the net* from last year. If reposting an article\n	constitutes posting an ad, then I am guilty. This post\n	did have a name and address and, yes, a price. If one\n	had posted the address and subscription price of "Newsweek",\n	would that be an ad? I get nothing from showing this stuff.\n2) I Posted a list of documents showing examples of the kind of\n	"proof" that was REQUESTED BY TED FRANK. He then complains\n	to my sysadmin saying that I am advertising and, lo and\n	behold, "poof", there goes my account. This one had an\n	address in it! Oh, no! I Guess that means it is an ad!\n\nIf you value the alternative view I have been discussing, or VALUE\nITS DISCUSSION even if you do not agree with it, I ask that you send\na note saying as much to me to show to the sysadmin. They rarely get\n"Ya know, that user on your net was real helpful..." or whatever; they\nonly get "I don't like what that user is doing because...".\nPlease do not send the note to the sysadmin. I need to take it to them\nin a manner that has at least a chance of getting through.\n\nIn my files here are hundreds of responses from people saying "Thanks for\nthe info" or "Could you send me such and such?" or "Your posts are\nvery interesting... keep it up." and only a handfull of "Go aways". But,\nI guess the fact that I have decided not to waste my time trying to\nconvince Ted is a Net Offense[TM] of such magnitude as to warrant\na message complaining about me. (Knock, knock..."My name is Ted and\nand this is Mark... We're from the thought police. Seems you have\nsome pretty dangerous ideas here, and we're here to confiscate them...")\nNWO Indeed!\n\nGuess I will have to go back to the drawing board and come up with\na new plan... Thanks Ted and Mike. Hope you are happy.\nI will be on for a few more days and then... that's all folks!\nYour comments and support are requested. I can no longer post\nto news. I ask what this has accomplished... Is there some benefit\nfrom making alternative views simply vanish? Not in my book. \nSeems the easiest way to win an argument is to make the opposing side\nshut up. Images of Waco.... ah, but alas... And all this when I am in the\nprocess of typing in a letter to me from the Tax Collector saying that\na lien was removed due to a letter that I wrote challenging jurisdiction.\nOh, well... It takes time to come up with the info requested, and I\nwas just getting started.\n\nIt should be noted that Ted Frank has been accused publicly over 40\ntimes of being an NWO supporter and has never made an statements to the\ncontrary. Further, what ARE Ted Frank's motivations for getting me axed?\nWe all know that SOME PEOPLE are getting paid to collect info on people\non the net that are of "interest" to the government, and Ted sure seems\nto have a *personal* interest in debunking me. Hmmm... just who does\nhe work for? The University of Chicago which he "attends"(?) is well\nknown as one of the biggest NWO supporters...\n\nAnd finally, if anyone would be able to help me find a new account here\nin the Boulder/Denver area, I would greatly appreciate it. I am in the\nprocess of installing Linux and so will be able to do UUCP or maybe\na TC/IP connection. Any help here would be greatly appreciated. Since I\nam longer be able to post news and will no longer have email VERY\nsoon, I hope that anyone who wishes to contact me will do so via:\n\n	A. J.

I'm sorry about your friend.  Really.  But this anecdote does nothing to\njustify the "war on drugs".  If anything, it demonstrates that the "war"\nis a miserable failure.  What it demonstrates is that people will take\ndrugs if they want to, legal or not.  Perhaps if your friend were taking\nlegal, regulated drugs under a doctors supervision he might not be in the\nposition he's in now.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n...Dale Cook    "Any town having more churches than bars has a serious\n                   social problem." ---Edward Abbey\nThe opinions are mine only (i.e., they are NOT my employer's)
This is a difficult problem for which there is no obviously good\nsolution.  One approach is simply to try and move political opinion\nand hope a new more libertarian consensus lasts for a while.  Another\napproach is to try and amend the constitution.  The original\nconstitution restrained the U.S. government from economic intervention\nfor 100 to 150 years, depending on just how one wants to count it.\nThe First Amendment, though weakened in many ways, still restrains\ngovernment (particularly state and local), even though on many\nparticular issues the majority is in favor of censorship.  I think\nlibertarians would be happy with another 100 years of restraint via\nan amendment or two (not that I think that's likely to happen).\n\nNot necessarily Mr. Hendricks, but other posters seem to see this as\na problem with libertarianism, that it cannot be stable.  That might\nbe true, but it is not an objection to libertarianism per se.  If\na libertarian political consensus forms for a decade or two and then\nfalls apart again, we would just be back where we are now.  This is\nunlike the case for socialism where a socialist consensus that held\nfor a while and then fell apart would not leave us where we are now,\nbut instead with lots of bureaucracy that would be hard to get rid of,\nif not tyranny as the end condition of a strong socialist consensus.
On the other hand, it would be kind of scary if there were *never* a final\nverdict, because a party to litigation could keep saying "Oops!  I forgot\nto bring up this evidence," and demand a new trial.  You get one bite at\nthe apple.\n\n\nIt's up to General Motors to find those witnesses in the first litigation.\nYou'd be up in arms if a plaintiff suing General Motors pulled the same\nstunt and made them relitigate an issue that they already lost.  It's not\nas if General Motors couldn't file enough discovery motions to delay the\ntrial until they found all the witnesses they wanted.\n\n\nDefine "obvious bias."\n\n\nDid GM move for a new trial on those grounds?  No?  Perhaps they had a \nreason?

{Sorry, Harel et al, but our doctors and most hospitals are still\nprivate in Canada as well as in much of Western Europe.}\n\n\nWrong.  In better EC countries that use pure (but public) health\ninsurance (like we use in Canada) rather than self-enclosed HMO-like\nsocialized medicine, 30% of our costs comes from private supplementary\ninsurance and/or copayments.  France Magazine's Summer 1992 edition\nhas a fantastic presentation of their basic insurance coverage,\nincluding a sample chart of copayment percentages.  For 1-30 days,\nyou're covered for 80% of the public hospital rate, 100% afterward.\nWith extra private insurance, you can get into a private hospital and\nbe covered for any differences beyond the public hospital rate.  The\npublic insurance covers 100% beyond 30 days, or the same cash amount\nfor a private hospital and the difference is paid out-of-pocket or\naccording to your supplementary private insurance.  Over 2/3rds of\nFrench have some form of extra private insurance.  So, 30% of health\ncosts in Europe are out of private funds and not gleaned from other\ntaxes.  The GDP figures are combined public and private expenditures\nfor total outlay using the same methods that yield the 13-14% figure\nfor the U.S.\n\nThat the French had deductibles and copayments in their insurance fund\nis to their credit ... I am in the minority for advocating such back\nin Canada (to make the Canadian insurance look more like real health\ninsurance -- which actually it is).  The new Reform Party, a breakoff\nof traditionalists from the Conservatives with a mildly "libertarian"\nfaction, hold our public health insurance as an untouchable but that\njust a few people have to be reminded that it's not free (the average\nCanadian/European is more fiscally naive than their American\ncounterparts on issues like these).\n\nI'm one of the few people who favour copayments (forget about\nleftists, even our conservatives attack me for it on the Canadian\nnewsgroups) to make it look more like real insurance, 'cos the 100%\ninsurance payment is hidden (unlike in France) and if you didn't know\nit, you'd believe it actually is socialized medicine (American\nconservatives/libertarians and Canadian leftists are the only ones who\nseriously call it that).  Canadians aren't worried about the\nAmericans, who spend 14%; we're worried about the French and Germans\nwho spend 7% to our 9% ... so the insurance is looking at things that\nshouldn't be paid for out of general funds like physicals for\ninsurance policies, sick notes, electrolysis, etc.  The reason that\nthe Canadian health insurance hasn't spiralled out of control despite\nbeing open and universal is that unlike Americans, there is no urge to\nspend all of your benefits' worth, and more if you can ... we're a\ndifferent culture.\n\n\n"Managed Care" relies on HMO's, which are unknown in most western\nnations that use only public health insurance like Canada, France\nand Germany (I'm Canadian, and my German father-in-law-to-be says\nof HMO/NHS approaches, "We left that behind with East Germany!").\nSure, HMO/NHS controls costs because you have managers strangling\ndoctors with budget strings.\n\nIn Canada, we use the public health insurance approach as in France\nand Germany, with all private doctors and both private and public\nhospitals.  It is all pure insurance without HMO's.  The divisions\nare different, with the Germans using a couple hundred interlinked\n"sickness funds" over a century old while Canada divides by their\nprovinces (who run the insurance fund and set local fees with the\ndoctors monopoly; federal funds cover the fees disbursed.)\n\nWith such an open-ended system, it's no surprise that Canada is #2 to\nthe U.S. in costs; all-insurance is the most expensive way to go. The\nFrench and Germans use the same approach but have larger populations\nin more compact geography to improve scales of economy.\n\ngld

The DEA and other organizations would have the American people\nbelieve that we are winning the "war on drugs".  I'm going to\ndispel the propaganda that the DEA is putting out by showing\nyou the drug war's *real* status. To help prove my assertions\nI've also posted two articles from USA Today that clearly\ndemonstrate that drug use among certain age groups *is* on the\nrise.  If WOD is working, as we're led to believe, then drug\nabuse should have gone down substantially by now.  The reality\nis, is that it has not gone down very much.  If anything,\nsubstance abuse is on the rise.  I'm also going to supply a\npossible solution to this problem.\n\nThe following text is an excerpt from an article about rock music\nand pot entitled "Hello Again, Mary Jane" which appears in the\ncurrent issue of Time magazine (April 19, 1993, p. 59).\n\n    Law-enforcement officials say pot advocates are just blowing\n    smoke when they talk about the comeback of the weed.  "Perhaps\n    because of the change of administrations, the marijuana lobby\n    is out in full force," says Robert Bonner, head of the Drug\n    Enforcement Administration.  "The fact is, they're losing the\n    battle."  In 1985 more than 23% of youths ages 12 to 17 said\n    they smoked marijuana; in 1991 that figure was 13%, and Bonner\n    says it is still falling.  Bonner also offers a reminder that\n    studies confirm such marijuana health risks as destruction of\n    nerve cells in the brain and lung damage.\n\nThe chart that follows was taken from the Wednesday, April 14, 1993\nissue of USA Today ("Drug Use Up Among U.S. Eigth-graders" by Mike\nSnider, p. 6D).\n\n    Adolescents' choices\n\n    Drugs used by eighth graders in the last month:\n                      Estimated, per 100 students\n                             1991     1992   Pct. chg.\n    Alcohol                  25.1     26.1        +4%\n    Cigarettes               14.3     15.5        +8%\n    Marijuana                 3.2      3.7       +16% \n    Amphetamines              2.6      3.3       +27%\n    LSD                       0.6      0.9       +50%\n    Cocaine                   0.5      0.7       +40%\n    Crack                     0.3      0.5       +67%\n\n    Source:  University of Michigan Institute for Social Research,\n    1993 report\n\nWe are not winning the "war on drugs".  I think you can see that one\nof the tactics that the DEA employs to give people the impression that\nthe "war on drugs" is being won is to selectively quote statistics---\nonly statistics that support their contention that drug use has gone\ndown.  The excerpt from Time magazine that I included in this post is\nan excellent example of how organizations like the DEA attempt to\ndeceive the public.\n\nUsage of *one* particular drug may have gone down but at the same\ntime usage of other drugs may have gone *up* (a.k.a. substitution).\nAlso, drug usage among *one* particular age group may have gone down\nbut drug usage among another age group may have gone *up*.  Therefore,\nif one takes a look at the big picture, taking into consideration *all*\nthe statistics, then it's obvious that the so-called "war on drugs" is\nbeing lost.  Perhaps the drug war is being won as far as illegal drugs\ngo, but if one factors in alcohol abuse, smoking, and use of inhalants,\nthen the magnitude of the drug problem in this country can then placed\nin its true perspective.\n\nFor those of you who don't consider alcohol to be a drug then try\ndrinking a fifth of whiskey sometime and then come back and tell me\nthat it's not a drug.  Agencies like the DEA only go after *illegal*\ndrugs.  This is one of the reasons why the drug war is a fruitless\nattempt at preventing substance abuse---people will merely switch to\nanother drug if the one they were using becomes scarce or unpopular.\n\nThe solution to the drug abuse problem in this country may be to\nlegalize some---not all---drugs whose toxicity has been shown to be\nwithin reasonable limits (you won't drop dead after using it a few\ntimes) and then couple this with a massive drug education program.\nThe reason why I think legalization is *part* of the solution is\nbecause people seem to be able to easily obtain drugs despite the\ngovernment's efforts to the contrary---the money spent on drug\ninterdiction could be spent more effectively elsewhere (e.g., drug\neducation).  Additionally, legalization would reduce crime because\nthe profit motive would be taken out of drug trafficking which often\ngoes along with other kinds of crime.  Not to mention the fact that\naddicts would have less reason to prey on innocent people for their\nmoney and posessions in order to support their expensive habit;\nlegalization would cause the street price of drugs to fall\nsubstantially so drugs would be much more affordable to addicts.\n\nIMHO, the way to reduce substance abuse is to do to drugs what has been\ndone to smokers:  make drug use socially unacceptable rather than try to\nemploy heavy-handed law enforcement and punish people by incarcerating\nthem.  As you already know, people in the U.S. smoke a lot less than\nthey used to.  This reduction in the number of smokers has been brought\nabout by public awareness campaigns, laws restricting where people can\nlight up, warning labels on cigarette packages, taxation on tobacco in\norder to reduce consumption, and so on.  I propose that similar methods\nbe used to reduce substance abuse after legalization has been carried\nout.  They are as follows:\n\n    * Drugs being sold must come with clear, concise information which\n      states the possible health hazzards involved with using this\n      product and recommendations on how the drug should be used.\n      Things like dosage levels and how long the drug should be used\n      ought to accompany the packaging the drug is contained in.\n\n    * All drugs should be taxed at a rate that generates a lot of\n      revenue but not so high as to encourage people to acquire drugs\n      through illegal channels.  Part of the revenue collected from\n      drug taxes should be used to fund drug education and law\n      enforcement.\n\n    * Make it a felony to sell drugs to minors (people under the age of\n      18).  Anyone can sell drugs but they must not dodge paying the\n      taxes on drugs or sell drugs with the warning information absent.\n      Failure to pay the appropiate taxes on drugs or omitting warning\n      information should also be a felony.\n\n    * Establish a government agency whose job is to insure that the\n      purity and safety of all drugs is as high as possible.  This\n      agency would try to prevent people from getting a hold of bad\n      drugs---something that is a fairly serious problem now.\n\nI'm sure that many of the things I've discussed in this article have\nbeen hashed out before in this newsgroup.  Nevertheless, I thought\nit was a good idea to give my two cents (actually a buck and a half...)\nall at once so you could get a good idea of where I currently stand on\nWOD.  Go ahead and tear into my post; I'm sure there is something in it\nthat you may wish to take a different view on or flame. :) :) :)  BTW,\nI posted the articles from USA Today to not only help prove my\nassertions but also to provide information on LSD usage among youths---\nsomething which I noticed some posters to this group were interested in.\n\nScott Kennedy,  Brewer and Patriot

Who compared Quayle to Gore?  Mark said he had never heard of any incident\nin which the thrower of the ceremonial ball had been booed before.  I mentioned\nanother incident.  (And if the media had a liberal bias, I'm sure he would\nhave heard of the Quayle incident.)\n\nIf I was to compare Quayle to anyone, it most likely would be Elmer Fudd.
Wrong on both accounts.\n\n\nNo one is a "rioter" until they participate in a "riot", which is \nunlikely to happen, now.\n\nMost of the *people* in L.A. are likely to have gotten up early to \nlisten to the court announcement.\n\n\nSorry to disappoint you, but this seems unlikely.\n\n\nI don't think he was told.\nHowever, his statement was still appropriate.\n\n\nJury duty is a solemn duty to be taken seriously.  It is not meant \nto be a source of pride or instant fame.\n\n\nWell, the many *people* who got up early to go to the court to hear \nthe verdict found that justice was served.  Given your dire and \ncynical predictions, I imagine that it is you who will be surprised.  :-)
But you still get into trouble. For example - how often are crimes\nof violence not "hate crimes"? The question is then who are you\nhating? If its another gang member, then its better than if\nthe person you hate is of a differnt color? \n\nAlso, is it realistic to declare that crimes of hate are worse\nthan crimes of gross negligence? (Like random drive by shootings\nwhere they can't be hate crimes because the shooter doesn't know\nwho he is going to hit - he just shoots into the crowd).\n\n\n\nFirst, I heard today that there is a good chance that the U.S. instead\nof New York is going after the bombers. This means no capital punishment.\n\nSecondly, double jepardy does help keep the government from going after\nyou for first one murder, then the next, etc. A "sovereign" has essentially\none chance with a single fact pattern (such as the World Trade Center bombing).\nThat is why the bombers will in all probability be tried for all the\ndeaths, as well as the property damages, as well as conspiracy, at once.\nOf course, as we discovered in the Rodney King case, there are two\n"sovereigns", neither of which can try you twice for the same crime.
Do you have a cite for the case?  You don't give enough\ninformation to be able to compare the two situations.\nIf the demonstrators had been blaring loud rock music \ninto the landlord's home all day and night, then I could\nsee how the opinion would be justified.  But this court\norder had prohibited abortion protesters from displaying\npictures of dead fetuses, which doesn't disrupt the privacy\nof anyone inside the clinic.  \n\n\nPerhaps in the privacy of their homes, but not on public\nproperty.  Did the Korean grocery store owner in New York\ncity have a right to be free from the speech of the protesters \noutside his store?  Patrons inside the store could hear the \nprotesters asking them to re-consider shopping there -- how \nis that different from the abortion protesters asking women \nto re-consider getting an abortion at a clinic?  \n\n\nEven if the protesters' speech could be considered\n"harassment" (which it is not), hate speech laws have \ngenerally been struck down by the courts.  I don't see \nhow the words ``don't kill your baby'' or ``abortion is \nmurder'' could be considered harassment.\n\n\nSome of the protesters were arrested for simply praying\nquietly on a public sidewalk.  Yeah, I could see how\nthat might be equivalent to "bombing" and "murder".\nUh huh.  Let us know when you get a grip on reality.
Yes, it was Nixon who was most vocal about giving money to Russia.  It\nmakes me proud to be a libertarian.  It appears both conservatives and\nliberals prefer to cold war until you win, then nurse the enemy back to\nhealth for another go around.\n\nIt's like subsidizing the wealthy countries (Japan, Germany, etc.) with\nfree defense, and then trade-warring with them because of the economic\ncompetition.  It's like subsidizing tobacco farmers while paying\nbureaucrats to pursuade people not to smoke.\n\nI ask myself, what law could we pass to prevent government from doing\nstupid, frivilous things with OUR money?  Then I think, the Constitution\nwas supposed to do that.  Could someone please tell me what legitimate\nconstitutional power the federal government is using when it takes money\nfrom my paycheck and gives it to needy countries?  Seriously.\n\nRoger Collins

I don't think that this is accurate. I believe, and could be wrong, that\nthere IS a specific right allegedly to have been violated, like the\n14th or due process or whatever.\n\n\nDouble jeopardy does not apply, but not for the reasons you quote. Double\njeopardy states that a person may not be tried twice on the same charge.\nHowever, the police are not on trial for the crime of excessive force\nor assault. They are NOW on trial for the DIFFERENT crime of violating\nMr. King's civil rights. \n\nAS for the city and county or state trying you more than once, \nit most likely will not happen. This is because cities and states\nhave separate laws governing behaviour. For example, in some states,\nit is an offence to carry marijuana, but not a city offence. Also,\nI think murder is against federal, but not some state laws.

To Have and to Hold the same unto the \nsaid parties hereto, equally, jointly, as tenants in common, with equal rights \nand interest for the period or term of their lives, and to the survivor thereof \nat the death of the other."
The article that follows was taken from the Wednesday, April 14, 1993\nissue of USA Today ("Drug Use Up Among U.S. eighth-graders" by Mike\nSnider, p. 6D).\n\n    A new national survey says drugs are easier to get, more teens are\n    using them and fewer deem drug use as risky. \n\n    For the last two years, government officials have trumpeted results\n    from the National High School Survey as signs that the drug war is\n    being won.  But this year, officials are retreating - drug use by\n    eighth-graders has risen, according to the survey of 50,000 students\n    nationwide.\n\n    Possible reason for the increase:  more experimentation.  Why?  If\n    drug use dropped during the '80s, eventually some students will\n    have fewer "drug-using contemporaries" who act as examples of\n    substance abuse's drawbacks, says social psychologist Lloyd Johnston,\n    one of the survey authors.  Each new wave of youths "must be given\n    the knowledge, skills and motivation to resist using these drugs,"\n    Johnston says.\n\n    This type of resurgence "is possible," says Eileen Shiff, author of\n    "Experts Advise Parents" (Delta, $14.95).  But that's not the issue,\n    she says.  The prevalence of alcohol and drugs among teens today\n    could result in more alcoholic adults decades from now.\n\n    Aggravating the problem:  baby boomer parents - who experimented with\n    drugs and alcohol as teens - trying to be friends, not parents, to\n    their children.  "I've even seen parents serving kegs of beer" to\n    their underage kids and friends, Shiff says.  For a recent graduation,\n    Shiff and other parents organized an all-night, "lock-in" party where\n    no booze or drugs were allowed.  "We need to fulfill that parental\n    role, otherwise the peer group takes over," she says.\n\n    Officials may "talk about the war on drugs, but they really haven't\n    done anything that I've seen," says Suzanne Linkous, Scottsdale,\n    Ariz., 16, a volunteer who talks with teens about drugs, dating and\n    other issues on a peer counseling and suicide hot line.  Linkous, a\n    member of USA Today's Teen Panel, says "there's always going to be\n    experimentation" with drugs.\n\n    A real war on drugs could be waged "education-wise," she says.  But\n    "some don't want to give kids the facts.  They think it will give\n    them ideas; it's the same with birth control.  I think you should\n    give the kids the information or have it accessible" through classes,\n    pamphlets and speakers, she says.\n\n    Education efforts need to start as soon as kids get in school - in\n    kindergarten, says Dallas Owens, 17, teen panelist from Miami Shores,\n    Fla.  "I remember in kindergarten, I used to see (drugs).  I think\n    kids in the 10th and 12th grades have already made up their minds\n    (about using drugs)," he says.\n\n    Scare tactics in public service announcements aren't working; only\n    one commercial has gotten it right, he says.  The commercial opens\n    with two "good-looking girls" in the restroom talking about having\n    no prom date.  Then they take a hit off a joint.  "That hits home\n    because it's not attractive," he says.  "You can't be doing drugs if\n    you want somebody to like you."\n\n\n    Adolescents' choices\n\n    Drugs used by eighth graders in the last month:\n                      Estimated, per 100 students\n                             1991     1992   Pct. chg.\n    Alcohol                  25.1     26.1        +4%\n    Cigarettes               14.3     15.5        +8%\n    Marijuana                 3.2      3.7       +16% \n    Amphetamines              2.6      3.3       +27%\n    LSD                       0.6      0.9       +50%\n    Cocaine                   0.5      0.7       +40%\n    Crack                     0.3      0.5       +67%\n\n    Source:  University of Michigan Institute for Social Research,\n    1993 report\n\n\nScott Kennedy,  Brewer and Patriot
Garrett, you are a really pathetic liar.\n\nSome of your charges are arguable, but most of them are obvious lies.\n\nI challenge you to present us with any evidence that Nixon stole,\nrigged a national election, never mind elections, or used the powers\nof his office for personal gain.\n\nYou can't because there is absolutely no evidence that any of these\nevents occurred.
Pardon me for interrupting, but why doesn't anyone ever bring up other\npossibilities besides more government, less government, or no government\nand stop there? It seems to me that the problems with society go MUCH\ndeeper than government. Democracies seem to reflective of the majority\nof society, both the good and the bad. If you take away the government,\nyou still have the structural flaws in society, except this time, with\nno restraints. Yes? No?\n	Why doesn't anybody ever discuss communal society, like a\nkibbutz? I never studied it on depth, but from what I've heard, the kibbutz\nin Isreal was very successful. It is also very close to what Aristotle\nand Socrates believed was the best.\n	Sorry to detract from the discussion.\n\n\nBut what good is change if there is no tracable improvement in the human\ncondition? Who would ever support the change if you tell them it won't \nimprove their lives? I know that there are, and will be, libertarians \nwho will jump in now and say that it WILL improve our lives. I can deal\nwith that. All I'm saying is that improving the human condition must\nbe the PRIMARY goal of any organization.\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n"Who said anything about panicking?" snapped Authur.

Well, a student body president can't exactly campaign on the stand\nthat he's "tough on crime".  Their job is to listen to what people want\nand fund things that make sense.\n\nCondoms and marijuana aren't exactly the worst things to have available\neither...
# #  "Abortions destructive of the fetus must be permitted, even\n# #   just before birth, if they promote what the [Supreme] Court\n# #   calls ``health''\n# \n# Yes, Doug, we all know that Roe v. Wade prevents states from prohibiting\n# abortions necessary to preserve the life or health of the woman.  Only\n# very stupid people (such as yourself) confuse a discussion of mental health\n# related to "Jane Doe", who was in a mental institution, and attempt to claim\n# that this same argument could be applied to a woman who decided she wanted\n# an abortion because she was having a "bad hair day".\n# \n# As you well know, the facts are that there are about 100 third-trimester\n# abortions performed in this country annually, and those are *only* done for\n# *serious* health reasons.\n# --\n# Larry Margolis, MARGOLI@YKTVMV (Bitnet), margoli@watson.IBM.com (Internet)\n\nHmmm.  Human gestation period is something like 39 weeks.  That means\nthird trimester abortions are those done after 26 weeks.  In consulting\na 1989 World Almanac, I see that 1% of abortions in 1983 were done at \n21 weeks or more.  That's about 1268 abortions in 1983 after 21 weeks.\nUnless the number of abortions performed has dropped dramatically, or\na LOT of abortions are done between 21 and 26 weeks, I think you are\nwrong.\n\nBy the way, Roe v. Wade allowed states to adopt very, very broad\nprohibitions on third-trimester abortions, but some states, such as\nCalifornia, declined to do so.  It was reported* that what finally \nstopped third trimester elective abortions in the Bay Area wasn't law, \nbut that the only hospital doing them ran out of nurses, then doctors,\nwilling to do them.  Not surprisingly, the bay area NOW chapter was\nterribly upset about this.\n\nI remain pro-choice, but when pro-choicers compare abortion in a\nclinic to a religious ritual in a church, you have to start wondering\na bit if the pro-life criticism of abortion as modern human sacrifice\ndoesn't have a grain of truth to it.
THE WHITE HOUSE\n\n                  Office of the Press Secretary\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nFor Immediate Release                        April 15, 1993\n\n\n\n AMERICAN UNIVERSITY PRESIDENT JOSEPH DUFFEY NAMED TO HEAD USIA,\n        MICA TO CHAIR BOARD FOR INTERNATIONAL BROADCASTING\n\n\nWashington, D.C. -  President Clinton today announced his \nintention to nominate American University President and former \nState Department Assistant Secretary Joseph Duffey to be Director \nof the United States Information Agency. The President also \ndesignated Daniel Mica Chairman of the Board for International \nBroadcasting.\n     \n     "Joe Duffey's expertise in the fields of education, \ncommunications and foreign affairs is vast and will serve him \nwell as he takes the helm at USIA and works to promote the ideals \nof democracy and freedom abroad," the President said. \n\n     President of American University in Washington, D.C. since \n1991, Duffey previously served nine years as Chancellor and \nPresident of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst.

Quite the \ncontrary,  I think a better proving ground would be someplace that already\nhad a governemnt that would prevent outright acts of agression,  yet had a\nstrong spirit of individualism and initiative.  Someplace like... Texas :-)
I was a graduate student in the early 1980s, and we had a conference on \nReaganomics where Jerry Jordan, then a member of the Council of Economic \nAdvisors, was a speaker.  I had the pleasure of driving him back to the \nairport afterwards, and since taxes were the main topic of discussion I \nthought I would ask him about the VAT.  I have favored it for these reasons \nyou mention, that the income base is too hazy to define, that it taxes \nsavings and investment, that it is likely to be more visible.  He agreed, \nand reported that the CEA at that time was in favor of VAT.  So why not \npropose it?  I asked.  He replied that the Reagan White House feared that \nthe Democrats would introduce VAT *in addition to* the income tax, rather \nthan in lieu.  Better not to give them any ideas, he said.\n\nPretty prescient.\n\nYes, any Canadian readers, please tell us if the tax is displayed on price \nstickers (I'm relatively certain it is not in Europe).
Reasonable doubt dates back to Human Rights. We are now in the time of\nCivil Rights. Civil Rights are issued by the State with whatever strings\nattached they choose as the Grantor of said rights. And if that means that \nverdicts are determined by the needs of the state rather than by guilt or \ninnocence in a traditional sense, so be it. Being subjective rather than \nobjective may make it harder to anticipate what is right, and you may be \nsacrificed for being wrong inadvertantly once in a while, but that really is a \nsmall price to pay for the common good don't you think?
My opinion is this:  In a society whose economy is primarily based on \ncapitalism, the role of government should be to provide those goods and \nservices that need providing for the general public's good.  BUT government \nshould supply those necessary goods and services only when it is impossible \nfor a private enterprise (or individual) to make money from providing them.\nI agree with some of the other posts that this train probably can not make \nmoney and will rely heavily on State tax dollars.  \n\nThe question, I think, then becomes:  Do we, the general public, need the train?\n\nI certainly do not, nor will I ever, need this train in Lubbock, Texas.  With\nthe inexpensive air travel provided between Dallas and Houston, I don't think\npeople in Dallas or Houston need it either.
What's the difference, in practice?\n\nIt amounts to your saying, it's disgusting but should be legal,\n\n***or***\n\nsomeone else saying, let's allow the parties involved to decide what is\ndisgusting.\n\nOr, if you're like me, you think that it ISN'T a coercive law, because\nsome children can't make informed consent.\n\nBrian

Why is this surprising? Then the _Times_ can get a few more\nPulitzers the same way they did last year.\n--
The status of the House of Lords today is quite different to its status \nin 1789. \n\n\n\nMaddison and Hamilton were both studying existing forms of government for\nseveral years before they wrote the federalist papers. That the US system\nis based to a considerable degree on the UK model is pretty widely accepted.\nAt the time there was no other major country with a representative body.\nThe French plebicite had been suppressed for 140 years and its restoration\neight years later would mark the start of the French revolution. \n\nAfter the UK system the major influences were the Dutch system and of course\nthe classical systems. Nobody seriously suggests that Rome or Greece were \nmodels though because the political systems of both countries were acknowleged\ndisasters. The main lesson learnt from Greece was that unless a federal\nstate was constructed a war would be inevitable. The Greek democracies were\nalways fighting amongst themselves which is how Rome managed to invade. Had\nthe federal consitution been rejected the new Roman empire in the shape of\nBritain would quite certainly have reabsorbed much of the colonies in due\ncourse. Moreover the states would have been at each others throats as soon\nas the Louisiana purchase situation arose during the Napoleonic period.

Could it be because you're British, Phill, and living in Germany?\nWhile the EC working rules are more liberal than what we have in\nthe 1989 US-Canada FTA, there's probably a law about that (having\nhealth insurance coverage is a condition of my being down here,\nfor example).\n\nYou have mentioned this once before, yet both the NY Times profile on\nthe German sickness funds (late Jan.) and pamphlets that my girlfriend\ngives to her language students from the German consulate both say that\nit is "voluntary" (okay, there were quotation marks (-;) and that only\n90% of the population is covered by the sickness funds (analogous to\nour provincial health insurances, but not divided by province/state).\n\nAnother guy in health care policy says that the Turkish guest workers\naren't covered ... he's written to me a couple of times (he's not a\npost-er).

:Of course, one again faces the question of how one circumscribes government\n:power (and keeps it circumscribed) in a complex society when it is in the \n:interest of neither capitalists nor consumers to refrain from using \n:government power for their own ends.  But apart from that little \n:conundrum...\n	Without having a complete answer to this question,  I should think\nit obvious that the first step should be to convince people this would be\na desirable result.  There are still quite a lot of people who feel that\nthe command economies of eastern Europe failed due to corruption rather than\nessential weaknesses of caommand economies,  and you still have a majority\nin this nation that favors keeping unenforced and unenforcible laws on\nthe books in order to "send a signal".\n\n\n:It would seem that a society with a "failed" government would be an ideal\n:setting for libertarian ideals to be implemented.

Also,\nthey tend to get invaded before they can come to anything like a stable\nsociety anyway. \n\n\n:I wouldn't call it "vague."  I'd call it elastic.  All "regulation" is \n:not necessarily the same.  By opposing all government regulation, some \n:libertarians treat every system from a command economy to those that\n:regulate relatively free markets as identical.  That's one reason\n:many of the rest of us find their analysis to be simplistic. \n\nUmm, is there any distinction between "vague" and "elastic" in this\ncontext aside from one having a more positive connotation than the other?\n\nAt any rate,  we've been through all this before.\n\n:Steve Hendricks                        |  DOMAIN:  steveh@thor.ISC-BR.COM   \n:"One thing about data, it sure does cut|  UUCP:    ...!uunet!isc-br!thor!steveh\n: the bulls**t." - R.

OK.  I stand corrected.  I guess, then, that the comments about payoffs\n(i.e., "pork") to Puerto Ricans that others have been making still\nstands?\n\nNow, everybody, how about some opinion on the following related topic:\n\nShould the people who are natives of U.S. territories have\nrepresentation in the U.S. House of Rep's or the U.S. Congress?\nThe U.S. Constitution sets up the House of Representatives to represent\neach State in proportion to its population, and the Senate to represent\neach State equally.  What should be done with U.S. territories like\nPuerto Rico?  Does anyone have knowledge about how this was handled in\nthe past, such as with the Louisiana Territory or the Northwest\nTerritory?\n\nChris
# #Slavery makes economic sense (it NEVER makes MORAL sense) when human\n# #muscle power is an economically valuable asset. Agricultural slavery might\n# #have lasted right up to the first mechanical cotton reaper, but no\n# #further; reapers are cheaper than slaves, and don't have to be fed during\n# #the winter. \n# \n# This argument makes a several fundamental errors.  First "agricultural"\n# slavery was not limited to production of cotton.  In the American south\n# slave labor was used extensively to grow tobacco, sugar, and rice, all\n# of which remained labor intensive enterprises well into the 20th century.\n\nAnd of course, in states like Kentucky and Virginia, not well-suited to\nlarge-scale plantations, slave labor was used to make one of the most \nvaluable agricultural products of all: more slaves.  In some ways, this\ntreatment of humans beings as breeding livestock is the most horrifying\naspect of American slavery.\n\n# Second, although mechanization of cotton production could be expected to\n# reduce the demands for labor eventually, it was only in the 1940's \n# the mechanization of cotton production in the South largely eliminated\n# the labor intensive character of the operation, long after the "first\n# mechanical cotton reaper" was invented.\n\nThis is an interesting question.  Steinbeck's _Grapes of Wrath_\n(published in the 1930s), uses agricultural mechanization of cotton\nproduction in Arkansas as the cause of the Joad family being evicted\nfrom the land.  How many years were involved in the mechanization of\ncotton farming?

: The Selective Service Registration should be abolished.  To start with, the\n: draft is immoral.  Whether you agree with that or not, we don't have one now,\n: and military experts agree that the quality of the armed forces is superior\n: with a volunteer army than with draftees.  Finally, the government has us\n: on many lists in many computers (the IRS, Social Security Admistration and\n: Motor Vehicle Registries to name a few) and it can find us if it needs to.\n: Maintaining yet another list of people is an utter waste of money and time.\n: Let's axe this whole department, and reduce the deficit a little bit.\n\n	More "gridlock" talk from another relic of the past.  The\nSelective Service system creates jobs and is an investment in \nthe future of america......and whats wrong with that?\n\n	We need jobs because at this point in the recovery, the economy\nshould have generated 10 billion jobs and since it has not, the\ngovernment has to step in and help.  Shutting down selective service\nwould cost "good jobs" and we can't do that.  \n\n	What we really need is to involve selective service in a more\nclosely directed manner.  We need the selective service involved\nin environmental protection, high-speed rail, commuter aircraft, \ncivil rights, national service and health care.  Every dollar\nwe put into selective service now will get us $10 less spending\nin future.\n\n	I really believe now to think about it that selective service\nis long-past due for the creation of a cabinet position.\n\n\n	Your not beyond hope, just get back on america's side and\nstart doing your part for change.  What Bill needs from you\nnow is support for the economic stimulus and health care reform.\nYou need to devote all your energies to fighting gridlock and\nsupporting change.  Get on the team.  After all, the evil has\nbeen banished from washington and the time for complaint \nis past being neccessary.

(NOTE: cross-posted to alt.politics.italy and talk.politics.misc\n This is a reply to an article by Ed Ipser which also appeared in\n alt.politics.usa.misc and alt.politics.libertarian, but no longer belongs)\n\n\nI hate to defend Ed (the article was very poorly written) but here goes:\n\n\nItaly's per-capita debt is much higher than USA's.\n\n\n\nThis is *exactly* what the public in France & Italy perceive to be the\nproblem-- thus the French election and Italian pulizia.\n\n\nRegarding the post-pulizia Italy:\n\nWrong.  This is true perhaps only for the Lega Nord.\nThe referendum Sunday is expected to establish a British/American style\nfirst-past-the-post system in the Senate.  If implemented, it would\nencourage a two- (or perhaps three-) party system in Italy.\nMost likely the DC and PSI will not be these parties; rather there will\nbe a shakeup of the entire party structure from which 2 new parties\nwill emerge to dominate.  Will Lega Nord be one of these?  Who knows.\n\n(The Camera dei Deputati (lower house) will likely remain with\nProportional Representation for a while, but there is talk of switching a\nportion of that house, too. Maybe as much as 40% first-past-the-post)\n\nOverall, the electoral reform in Italy is a welcome change.  Italians\nare tired of having crappy government.  Porn stars, Pavarotti's and\nHunters & Fishers won't gain seats because PR is dead.  A good two-party\nsystem will bring Italy efficient, accountable government.\n\nIt's about time.
:I'm not sure why you don't consider it an option.  No one suggests that\n:such analysis should be left to "regulators."  In fact, the "re-inventing\n:government" movement provides just such a cost/benefit approach to the\n:analysis of public spending.  Libertarians would do well to learn more\n:about it. \n\n\n\nOkay,  let me try to explain this.\n\nWhen one votes for such a creature as a Senator or,  worse yet,  a President,\none votes not for specific policies but for a general package which must cover\nall issues for 4 or 6 years.  As such,  one's influence is highly diluted.\nI might add that,  even if one were free to vote on individual regulations,\nthe vast amount of time required for considering a particular regulation,\ncombined with the very small chance of one's vote making a difference,  would\nmake it unreasonable to expect the voter to make an intelligent decision\nwith respect to specific regulations.     \n:Sorry, but it strikes me that it is the only "feasible" approach.  What is\n:not feasible is a wholesale attack on all government regulation and \n:licensing that treats cutting hair and practicing medicine as equivalent\n:tasks.\n\nI'm not sure what you mean by "feasible" in this case.  Do you mean that\n[] are impossible in priciple,  or merely that it would be undesirable in\nfact?\n\n\n:Actually, the only areas of public spending above that strike me as \n:generating substantial support among libertarians are police and defense.\n\n2 of the four you saw fit to  mention,  and education of minors is always\nanother possibility,  since minors are generally considered not to be\nresponsible to make their own decisions as adults are.\n\n:(It is an interesting aside that as committed as libertarians claim to\n:be to a principle of non-coercion, the only areas of public spending\n:that they frequently support involve hiring people with guns....hmmm...)\n\nYou say this as if it were surprising,  yet in fact a necessary consequence\nof libertarian philosophy.  All non-coersive functions should be dealt \nwith privately,  therefore it follows that the only functions remaining to\nthe state are the coersive ones.\n\n:Perhaps you have.  May I suggest that you consider that revolutionaries\n:frequently generate support by acting as protectors of "geezers," \n:mothers and children.  Governments that ignore such people on the grounds\n:that "we don't have much to fear" from them do so at their own peril.\n\nMuch more likely it's drunken teenagers.  The groups in questionare more \nlikely\nto be worse off during and after a revolution than before.  In the unlikely\nevent that you missed my earlier sarcasm,  let me say this directly:\nThe idea that such programs as Social Security or AFDC should be considered\n"defense" (an idea which has been advanced in ths and other newsgroups) is\nso absurd a lie as to be unworthy of consideration.  Do you seriously\ndispute this?\n\n\n	I don't want to seem patronizing,  but you still seem to be laboring\nunder the delusion that under a socialized economic system it is reasonably\nintelligent and honest persons (like yourself) who make the decisions.\nI feel any third party added to a transaction is every bit as likely to be\nignorant or corrupt as the buyer or seller.  I don't expect you to agree\nwith me,  but you explain why you feel I'm wrong?
Who wants to look through the bars at some reactionary Liberal conspiracy-\ntheory idiots and see how they rant and rave at the erosion of their populist \nsupport?  This is very typical of the elitist Liberal attitude that The People \nare incapable of thinking for themselves.  This elitist attitude will be the\neventual undoing of the arrogant liberal tide sweeping America, as The People\nbegin to realize more and more that they are being treated like errant children\nand robbed of their freedoms by a bunch of Utopian arrogent socialist jerks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough I find myself often disagreeing with the populist rationale\nof Mr. Limbaugh, I find him entertaining and I often agree with his \nconclusions.  The fact that he sends liberal reactionaries like these\nidiots through the roof makes him all the more entertaining.\n\n\n\n\nActually, I find Limbaugh's oratory less than sizzling and his debating\nskills sometimes lacking, even though his conclusions are often correct.\n\nI would suggest that a bankrupt leftist ideology that hopes to use concentrated \npolitical power and a loaded gun to force everyone to do the "right" things\n(where "right" is defined by the elitist academics who lead the movement)\nis showing an acute case of "myopic social perspective", not to mention\narrogance and utter stupidity.\n\nLimbaugh is certainly far from perfect, but his opponents in the established\nbody politic and the media are the ones arguing for Federal control of\nvirtually all aspects of the lives of the Citizenry, and for the elimination\nof local control over Affairs Public.  \n\nPerhaps Limbaugh has a following because The People are tired of being treated \nlike errant children by a self-important group of arrogant controlling myopic \npeople who have no understanding of how life operates outside of the "oughta-be's"\ninside their own hopelessly closed minds.\n\n\n\n\nOK, let us take your word for that and work with it.  A nice specific\nincident.\n\n\n\n\nHmmm, "Congress shall pass no law regarding an establishment of religion,\nnor prohibiting the free exercise thereof."  Liberal translation: "the\nfederal government (as long as it is run by Liberals) may force local\nschool districts to include certain iconic content in Christmas displays,\nwhile prohibiting others."\n\nI think Limbaugh has you on this one.  It seems to me that he is arguing\nfor LESS imposition of the federal government into religion.\n\nNice job on the specificity of that one, too.\n\n\n\n[Analysis of historical/modern communication media deleted] \n\n\nAh yes, it is a conspiracy of profound proportions.  Methinks that you\nmay be a bit resentful of Mr. Limbaugh's success because you attribute it\nprimarily to luck (how, after all, could anyone with profound differences\nof opinion from yourself have become successful without the operation of\nconspiracy or blind luck!)  Do you feel this same level of knee-jerk\nresentment against lottery winners, or do you congratulate them on their\ngood fortune?\n\n\n\n\nThis should be great fun, since it is the Liberal movement in America\nthat is pushing the hardest for centralized fascist control of The People\nand business (government/business 'partnership' indeed), and Mr. Limbaugh \nis the populist nemesis of that movement.\n\nI have read Mr. Limbaugh's book, and although it was not the most literary\npiece I have read in recent memory it certainly did not contain "venom"\nat all, let alone "venom" comparable to an individual who callously murdered\nmillions out of racism.\n\n\n\n\nA very serious tone in that oratory.\n\n\n\n\nYou neglect to mention that Mr. Limbaugh (have you ever listened to his show, \nBTW?) continuously encourages his audience to think for themselves rather\nthan blindly following any media icon, himself included.  You yourself mention \nthat he makes no bones about his show being strictly about his own opinions.\nHe also adopts a rather satirical approach, and presumes his audience to be\nintelligent enough to distinguish satire from seriousness (and he says as much).\nThis is in contrast to the average mass-media show, in which the audience is\ntreated as society's intellectual lowest common denominator.\n\nI am sure that Adolf Hitler was a master of satire; I am sure he was just\nkidding when he said that the Jews were the cause of Germany's problems and\nneeded to be exterminated.\n\n\n\n\nThis is not religion, it is clearly a perverse worship of race.  Since\nChrist was a Jew, it seems quite unlikely that Hitler's characterization of\nthe Aryan as "the highest image of the Lord" fits with Christian doctrine.\n\n\n\n\nPrivate religious schools have a vastly better record of success than\npublicly funded schools.  American history is indeed primarily Judeo-\nChristian.  I suppose that Mr. Limbaugh pointing out facts is equivalent\nto Adolf Hitler worshiping the Aryan race.  I think you might be reaching\njust a wee bit here.\n\n\n\n\nDefinite suggestion that the government should control the entertainment\nindustry here.\n\n\n\nJust a guess here, but I don't think that Mr. Limbaugh would advocate\ngovernment control of Hollywood.  You should perhaps call his radio show\nto confirm this.  I believe this is more a criticism of Hollywood and the\ndepraved moral values it espouses, not an advocation of government control \nof Hollywood.\n\n90's Liberals, on the other hand, want to have complete government control \nof our school systems, so that the government can teach The People at an\nearly age the "right" way to view religion and morality.  I believe Mr. \nLimbaugh is against this, as his satirical use of the "young heads full\nof mush" hyperbole indicates.\n\n\n\n\nPretty strong conspiracy theory insinuated here, with an implicit plea for\ngovernment power to be used to break up the conspiracy.\n\n\n\n\nIndication here that "Elements of the Media" (since career is a self-selected\ncategorization, perhaps an inferred 'larger percentage than represented in\nthe populace at large') has a leftist bias.  Doesn't sound too unreasonable.\nNo insinuation that CNN should not report in an objective fashion, only\nthat for reporters to say that they do not have any personal bias in the\nsituation is disingenuous to megalomaniacal.\n\nYou may disagree, and it may well be exagerrated, but it is not an unreasonable \nopinion; and Mr. Limbaugh goes well out of his way to make sure that his \naudience knows that these are his opinions, unlike most other reporting that \npurports to achieve perfect objectivity but in actuality will in some degree \nor other, in a statistical sense, reflect the biases of the reporters.  Who \nis being disingenuous here, Mr. Shaw or Mr. Limbaugh?\n\nAgain, you should ask Mr. Limbaugh himself, but I expect that he would\noppose government control of the media.\n\n\n\n        \n\nIt is indeed depressing to see such myopia and tiresome Liberal arrogance.\nLiberals love to play games with paradigms as a way of discrediting people\nwho disagree with them.  Why don't you challenge conservative ideology\non an intellectual level rather than engaging in ludicrous comparisons?\nPerhaps the underpinnings of your ideology are intellectual only in that\nthey exist in your mind, not the real world.\n\n\n\n\nPerhaps there are a few among the intellectually challenged who percieve\nRush Limbaugh as a hate-monger, but in my experience he has been spreading\nlaughter at the ludicrous self-importance of the Left, not hatred.\n\nAs to Mr. Bush, you may be correct about his fascist economic leanings.\nMr. Reagan, on the other hand, did his best to reverse the fascist trend\nof government involvement in business.  Mr. Clinton is increasing fascism\nin America through "business/government partnership" and increased levels\nof taxation.  Perhaps you should not have skipped your vocabulary classes\nin grade school.\n\n\n\n\nHmmm.  Seems to me that Limbaugh is not in any way comparable to Hitler\nbecause he has not murdered six million Jews and many, many others out of\nracism.  I come from a mixed-race family, so I am quite well attuned to\nracism; I don't hear any coming from Rush Limbaugh.  The only place I hear \nracism coming from these days and being taken seriously is from the Liberal \nLeft.\n\nThe Liberal Left is the movement I see trying to get America hooked\non the opiates of Socialized Medicine, Socialized Transportation, Socialized\nEducation, etc.  The Left already has America hopelessly addicted to \nthat Liberal drug, the Social Security Chain Letter.  It is quite clear\nto me that while the Hitler analogy does not really apply to either Rush \nLimbaugh or William Jefferson Clinton, if one of the two is closer than \nthe other it is clearly the Fascist Clinton.\n\n\n\nThis is the same address as "Idiots Anonymous", isn't it?\n\n\nMatt Freivald\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\nLiBORGalism:\n             THINKING IS IRRELEVANT.

# #From the Santa Rosa (Cal.) Press-Democrat, April 15, 1993, p.

They also lie\nabout "10%" to keep politicians scared.\n\n# 2) It will be interesting to see the reaction when 2.5million queers\n#    gather in Washington DC. After all if there are only 6million of\n#    us then this is an event unprecidented in history...\n\nBut many of the people who will be marching aren't homosexuals, but\nother members of the leftist agenda.\n\n# #The article also contains numbers on the number of sexual partners.\n# #The median number of sexual partners for all men 20-39 was 7.3.\n# \n# Don't forget that 25% had 20 or more partners....\n\nNot surprising.

Indeed.  Reading the cases of people who've tried the various things\nMr. Teel suggests show that defendants fall into two classes: (1) those\nwho win on procedural grounds or some grounds not related to their\nclaim, and (2) those who lose.\n\nConsider Newman v. Schiff, 778 F.2d 460 (8th Cir.1985), which I've seen\ncited by tax protestors other than Mr. Teel as a win for Mr. Schiff.\nMr. Schiff offered $100,000 on TV to anyone who would call in the\nshow and cite any section of the Internal Revenue Code that says that\nan individual has to file a return.\n\nMr. Newman took him up on it.  Mr. Newman had seen the show in a rebroadcast\nthe next morning.  Mr. Schiff claimed that the offer only extended to\npeople who actually say the original broadcast, and so there was no offer\nfor Mr. Newman to accept, and so no unilateral contract was formed, and\nso Mr. Schiff did not have to pay $100,000.\n\nMr. Schiff was correct, and so won.  So, yes, Mr. Schiff won against a\nclaim on the $100,000 reward.  However, his win had nothing to do with\nthe tax code.

Since our doctors are private and the "system" is just an insurance\nplan, litigation would not involve the insurance fund.  Our lawyers\ndo not work on contingency, so that if you were to sue for malpractice\nthen you'd better be sure of winning to cover your fees ... likewise,\nif you were a doctor and subject of a suit, it's time to sweat.\n\n\nA few weeks ago, the president of the Canadian MA wrote a letter to\nthe NYT to decry a lobbyist's advert repeating the same old trash.\nThis is significant because the AMA and the CMA are interlinked\norganizations and he would not have done it without the approval \nof his AMA cronies.\n\n\nIt serves the same purpose as the Bethesda Naval Hospital ... since\nnot all hospitals can provide everything, maybe they have some stuff\nthat others don't?  (Ottawa's population is only a quarter million,\nif you include the surrounding counties.)\n\n\nPeople of influence will get their way in any system, American or\nEuropean.  It's the "Golden Rule" - he who has the gold makes the\nrules. (-;\n\nAs for annual budgets, those are actually annual grants for facilities\n(e.g., mops, pans, etc.) given to hospitals of which most are private\nnonprofit foundations (btw, I have no problem with having aggressive\nfor-profit hospitals like the French, who use our approach ... but in\nthe Paris region they have almost as many people as Canada does so\ntheir market is much more diverse).  The rest has to be made up for\nby billings from patients who use their services.\n\n\nThe GDP figures are combined public and private expenditures for total\noutlay, and  are compiled use the same methods by the OECD that yield \nthe 13-14% figure for the U.S.\n\n\nHow?  They are collecting premiums ... and I'm an advocate of having\ncopayments like the French do in their system in order to make it look\nmore like the real insurance that it is.  The private doctors and \nhospitals will still be there after the insurance (hypothically)\ndisappears, as they were there before it appeared.\n\n\nFor one thing, I think that Bob Rae is an idiot ...\n\n\nMost of OHIP comes from separate premiums on your paycheck if you are\na player ...  he wants to spend our money on other things than the\nhealth insurance.  Our high taxes are high for other spending but\nhealth insurance, which is separate and optional, and it is being \nspent in a nonpartisan manner by every party. )-;\n\nOHIP is just a health insurance plan; it does not provide any kind\nof health care, that is up to you and your private doctors.\n\n\nSome of the companies providing extra insurance are subsidiaries of\nAmerican companies, and their parents provide full insurance down\nhere.  Regardless, all firms up north can easily turn on cable TV\nto see how well the American firms are doing by being involved in\nbasic coverage.  The private firms are making too much money after\nhaving gotten rid of basic coverage.  They run around patting them-\nselves on the back for their own cooperation in providing extras \nfor those people who "deserve it".\n\n\nI agree ... they were in a win-win situation.  But right now, it seems\nthat they have won bigger, when you look at how full their coffers\nare.  Friends from my sisters' MBA class were still being flown out\nfor job interviews individually with insurance firms in London, ON,\n(Canada's insurance capitol a la Hartford) along with generous expense\nprivileges this year despite the ongoing post-recession blues.\n\ngld
Cite one of these conflicting statutes.

The principle of protecting life is abandoned based\non "action versus inaction."  Not much of a principle.

In case you missed it on the news....the first 16 Haitians\nof many that tested positive for HIV and were being held on a\nbase in Cuba have been flown to the U.S.\n     Further a U.S. judge has ruled that they must receive\nmedical treatment or be returned to a place where they could\nreceive same.\n\n      So guess what folks, we taxpayers get to pick up the tab \n(just as you might have expected) for people who have never\ncontributed a dime to the U.S. society.

OK, I should have said "former" enemy.  I was being sarcastic about what\ninterventionists want to do.\n\n\nCould we back him without forcing others to back him at the point of a\ngun?\n\nHave you considered a non-interventionist policy?  If market reform does\nhappen, Russia will certainly get *private* capital at *private* risk to\nhelp their economy.  They will even have incentive to do so for the same\nreason.  If they don't reform, then our government will probably\nconsider them enemies anyway and rather spend money to hurt rather than help\nthem.\n\nThen their's the ideological point.  We want to "win" Russia over to\nour type of government -- a type where the rulers can rule without limit\nover everyone's finances?\n\n\n\n\nIf a $1.6 billion gift was that important to our well being, couldn't it\nbe raised voluntarilly?  People already give over $100 billion a year to\ncharity.\n\n\n\nIt seems instead of gridlock on any scale, we have aid to Russia,\nexpensive space programs, national charity that doesn't help the poor,\nand probably, studies of drunken goldfish.  I think *limited* government\nis more key than how democratic it is.\n\n\nThat was an opinion, and libertarians are very big on free speech.\n\n\nIf you are pretty libertarian except on this one issue then you should\nbe VERY libertarian.  Consider it a compromise.  How much money would\nyour fellow Russia-aiders have to give to Russia if those you oppose\nweren't using the same government machine to steal money from you\nand your group for causes you don't support?\n\n\nPeople have been saying that for hundreds of years.\n\n\nAll the more reason to depend on the free market which can more\nefficiently process information, than to depend on rulers for decisions\non complex issues.\n\n\nRoger Collins
Actually, Jerry Brown essentially did...and Clinton, in his demagogue\npersona, condemned Brown for it in the crucial NY primary last year.\n\nHowever....\n\nWhy don't the Republicans get their act together, and say they\nwill support a broad-based VAT that would have to be visible\n(the VAT in Canada is visible unlike the invisible VATS they\nhave in Europe)\nand suggest a rate sufficient to halve income and corporate\nand capital gains tax rates and at a rate sufficient to give\nthe Clintons enough revenue for their health care reform, and\nforce an agreement with the Democrats that the top income tax\nrate would then be frozen for the forseeable future and could\nbe increased only via a national referendum.\n\nWhy not make use of the Clintons to do something worthwhile...\nshift the tax burden from investment to consumption, and get\nhealth care reform, and a frozen low top marginal tax rate\nall in one fell swoop.
THE WHITE HOUSE\n\n                  Office of the Press Secretary\n                  (Vancouver, British Columbia)\n_________________________________________________________________\nFor Immediate Release                               April 4, 1993\n\n	     \n                PRESS CONFERENCE BY THE PRESIDENT\n                        WITH RUSSIAN PRESS\n	     \n                           Canada Place\n                   Vancouver, British Columbia\n\n\n\n2:46 P.M. PDT\n\n	     	  \n	     Q	  I had two questions for both Presidents, so you \ncould probably answer for Boris, too.  (Laughter.)\n	     \n	     THE PRESIDENT:  I'll give you my answer, then I'll \ngive you Yeltsin's answer.  (Laughter.)\n	     \n	     Q	  The first is that this is the meeting of the \nPresidents, so the money that's being promised is government \nmoney, and naturally it's going to be distributed through the \ngovernment.  But you've indicated that three-quarters are going \nto be going to businesses.  So the question is how the Russian \nbusinesses themselves are going to be consulted, if ever?  What \nare the priorities, because there are several association of \nRussian businessmen existing already, so will they be invited to \nparticipate in setting up priorities for investment?  \n	     \n	     This is the first.  And second, to you.  We know \nthat polls, public polls in America do not show that Americans \nare very enthusiastic about giving this aid.  Like Newsweek polls \nsay that about 75 percent don't approve it, and New York Times \npublished that 52 percent support if it just prevents civil war; \n42 percent if it fosters democratic reform; and only 29 percent \nif it just personally supports Yeltsin.  How are you going to \nsort of handle this problem that Americans themselves are not \nvery enthusiastic?  Thank you.\n	     \n	     Q	  I have a question, I'm sorry -- is there going \nto be a translation of everything into Russian?  No, just the \nanswers.  Just the answers.  Okay.\n	     \n	     THE PRESIDENT:  The answer to the first question is, \nit depends on what kind of aid we're discussing.  For example, \nthe funds that will be set up for financing new businesses will \nobviously go to those businesses who apply and who seem to be \ngood risks and make the application.  The privatization fund will \nbe used to support the privatization of existing public \nenterprises.  Then there are some other general funds in the \nDemocracy Corps and other things which people in Russia will have \nsome influence over the distribution of.  \n	     \n	     With regard to your second question, let me say that \nI would think that there would be people in both countries who \nwould not feel too warmly toward simply the American government \ngiving money to the Russian government.  There's opposition to \nthat in Russia.  And in our country, throughout our whole history \nthere has been an opposition to foreign aid of all kinds.  That \nis, this has nothing to do with Russia.  If you look at the whole \nhistory of America, any kind of aid program has always been \nunpopular.  \n	     \n	     What I have tried to tell the American people is, is \nthis is not an aid program, this is an investment program; that \nthis is an investment in our future.  We spent $4 trillion --\ntrillion -- on armaments on soldiers and other investments \nbecause of the Cold War.  Now, with a democratic government in \nRussia, with the newly independent states, the remainder of them \nworking on a democracy and struggling to get their economies \ngoing, it seems to me very much in our interest to make it \npossible to do whatever we can for democracy to survive, for the \neconomy of Russia to grow because of the potential for trade and \ninvestment there, and for us to continue the effort to reduce \nnuclear weapons and other elements of hostility on both sides, on \nour side and on the Russian side.  \n	     \n	     So I don't see this as an aid program; this is an \ninvestment for the United States.  This is very much in the \ninterest of the United States.  The things I announced today, the \nsecond stage of the program, which I hope to put together next \nweek, in my view are things that are good for my country and for \nthe taxpayers and workers of my country.  \n	     \n	     Russia is a very great nation that needs some \npartnership now, some common endeavor with other people who share \nher goals.  But it would be a great mistake for anyone to view \nthis as some sort of just a charity or an aid issue.  That's not \nwhat it is, it's an investment for America and it's a wonderful \ninvestment.  \n	     \n	     Like all investments, there is some risk.  But \nthere's far less risk with a far greater potential of return than \nthe $4 trillion we spent looking at each other across the barrier \nof the Cold War.\n	     \n	     Q	  Mr. President, first of all thank you very \nmuch, indeed, for coming here and talking to us.  In the memory \nof the living correspondents, this is the first time an American \nPresident is doing this to the Russian press corps, so it's kind \nof a very measured breakthrough.  \n	     \n	     I have two questions.  One, in your introductory \nremarks of the other press conference, you mentioned in brief \nthat you discussed the START II and START I issues.  Could you \ntell us:  Did you reach an agreement with President Yeltsin as to \nwhat might be done in order to have Ukraine join the ratification \nof START I and the NPT regime?  And my second question is, how \nconfident you are that the United States Congress would be eager \nto support you in lifting Jackson-Vanik and other restrictions \ninherited from the Cold War?  \n	     \n	     PRESIDENT CLINTON:  First, we discussed the issue of \nUkraine with regard to START I and NPT, and generally, with \nregard to the need to proceed to have the other independent \nstates all be non-nuclear; but also to have the United States \ndevelop strong relationships with them.  We know that one thing \nthat we could do that would increase, I think, the willingness of \nthe Ukraine to support this direction is to successfully conclude \nour own negotiations on highly enriched uranium, because that \nwould provide not only an important economic opportunity for \nRussia, but also for Ukraine, and it would show some reaching out \non our part.  But we agreed that basically the people who signed \noff on the Lisbon Protocol have got to honor what they did, and \nwe agreed to continue to press that.\n	     \n	     I, myself, have spent a good deal of time trying to \nreassure Ukraine's leaders, specifically the President and the \nForeign Minister, that I want strong ties with Ukraine, that the \nUnited States very much wants a good relationship with Ukraine, \nbut that, in order to do what we need to do together to \nstrengthen the economy of Ukraine and to have the United States \nbe fully supportive, the commitment to ratify START I and to join \nthe NPT regime is critical.\n	     \n	     What was the second question?  \n	     \n	     THE PRESIDENT:  With regard to Jackson-Vanik and \nCOCOM, I would make two points:  First, I have agreed with the \nRepublican and Democratic leaders in the Congress that we will, \nas soon as I return, have a list of all the legislative and other \nrestrictions, some of them are regulatory in nature, imposed on \nrelations between the United States and Russia, that are legacies \nof the Cold War.  And we will see whether they're -- how many of \nthem we could agree to do away with right now, at least among the \nleadership of the Congress.\n	     \n	     With regard to Jackson-Vanik, I think there will be \nan openness to change the law if the Congress is convinced there \nare, in fact, no more refusniks, no more people who wish to \nemigrate who are not being allowed to.  If the fact is that there \nis no one there who would have been -- who the law was designed \nto affect, then I think that the desire to keep the law will be \nmuch less.\n	     \n	     With regard to COCOM, my guess is, and it's nothing \nmore than a guess, that the leadership of Congress and indeed my \nown advisers, might prefer to see some sort of phased movement \nout of the COCOM regime.  But I think they would be willing to \nbegin it in the fairly near future.\n	     \n	     Q	  Mr. Clinton, when I read your speech in \nAnnapolis, I got the impression that you have a completely \ndifferent personal -- and I stress that -- personal, not \npolitical approach towards Russia, compared to the approach of \nMr. Bush.  Could you formulate in a few words, what is the \ndifference between you as a personality and your approach -- the \ndifference between your approach to Russia and the approach of \nMr. Bush?  And who made you -- why did you cite Akhmatova in the \nlast part of your speech?\n	     \n	     THE PRESIDENT:  Let me say, first, I do not wish to \ncompare myself with President Bush or anyone else.  I can't say \nwhat was in his heart about Russia.  I can say that since I was a \nboy, I have been personally fascinated with the history, the \nmusic and the culture, and the literature of Russia.  I have been \nthrilled by Russian music since I was a serious student of music \nfor more than 30 years now.  I have read major Russian novelists \nand many of your poets and followed your ballet and tried to know \nas much as I could about your history.  \n	     \n	     And I went to the Soviet Union -- but it was then \nthe Soviet Union -- you may know it was a big issue in the last \npresidential campaign that I spent the first week of 1970 alone \nin Moscow and did not return again until three days before Mr. \nYeltsin was elected President.  But all that time I was away, I \nwas following events there very closely and hoping for the day \nwhen we could be genuine partners.  So I have always had a \npersonal feeling about Russia.  \n	     \n	     I remember, for example -- a lot of you know I like \nmusic very much.  One of the most moving experiences for me as a \nmusician was when Leonard Bernstein took the New York \nPhilharmonic to Moscow and played Shostakovich's Fifth Symphony \nto the Russians.  And he played the last movement more rapidly \nthan anyone had ever played it before because it was technically \nso difficult.  That is something I followed very closely when it \noccurred.  \n	     \n	     These are things that have always had a big impact \non my life.  And I had just always hoped that someday, if I ever \nhad the chance to, I could play a role in seeing our two \ncountries become closer partners.  (Applause.)\n	     \n	     THE PRESS:  Thank you.
Please point out where I have said I even _was_ a member of that group,\nmuch less asked to be treated as such, much less insisted upon it.\n\n\nWait a minute.  You've been claiming for quite a while now that\npedophilia, according to CA state law, is a sexual orientation.  Now\nyour position is that the law doesn't specifically exclude it?\n\nYou know damn well what's going to happen.  Some guy in a NAMBLA\nT-shirt's going to apply at a day-care, they're going to turn him down,\nhe's going to take it to court, and the court's going to rule that\nsexual orientation is defined as homosexuality, heterosexuality, or\nbisexuality.\n\nUnless and until that court decides that pedophilia is a sexual\norientation, you have no business saying so.\n\n\nDespite the fact that all homosexuals are lying bastards?\n\n\nAh.\n\nSo, for example, you are opposed to the Civil Rights Act of 1964?\n\n\nThere's no "for purposes of this act, the term 'sexual orientation' will\nbe defined as" section?  No definitions anywhere?  Did they run this\nthrough the state Congress on an accelerated schedule or something?
I can only say that those people are wrong. The word harass means to \nirritate or torment persistently; I'd hardly consider one time to fall\nunder the definition of persistent.  Additionally, there is no basis\nto assume the behaviour is unwanted, unlike an illegal proposition.\n\nI was speaking from a legalistic viewpoint.  What you say is true, but\nthe law, in order to make what little sense it manages to make, has to\nmake *some* assumptions.  Assuming that an illegal activity is unwanted\nby the average citizen I think is reasonable.  Certainly, I would need\na preponderance of evidence on the side of the propositioner that there\nwas a reasonable belief that the proposition was welcome.\n\nThe number of people who participate in "victimless" crimes notwithstanding,\nthe fact reamins that under the law, the activity is illegal.  To presume\nthat the proposition *is* welcome simply because a large number of people\nindulge in it is the type of sophistry only a lawyer could indulge in\nwith a straight face.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n...Dale Cook    "Any town having more churches than bars has a serious\n                   social problem." ---Edward Abbey\nThe opinions are mine only (i.e., they are NOT my employer's)

"...a la Chrysler"??  Okay kids, to the nearest thousand, how many\ndollars did the government spend to "bail out" Chrysler?  More than zero\nyou say?  \n\nBzzzzzzzzzt.  Wrong answer.
I'm afraid that I've lost the thread here.  I didn't suggest that all \ngovernment regulations be subject to referenda.  So I don't follow the \ncomments above.\n\n\nI mean that an ideology that treats all government regulation as equally\nundesirable and seeks to abolish all regulations is unlikely to draw\nsupport among more than a miniscule portion of the electorate.\n\nFurthermore, I am suggesting that such a plan is not feasible in an\nindustrial society because the weight of litigation and/or misery it\nwould produce would effectively crush productive effort.\n\nNo, I'm not surprised.  I just think it's interesting that on one hand\nlibertarians assume a limited government can be decreed, yet on the other\nposit an entire government made up of people who carry guns.  (I realize\nthat many libertarians assume that such a government will be \ncounterbalanced by a fully armed citizenry, but it is worth noting that\nwidespread civilian ownership of guns does not necessarily prevent the\nestablishment of totalitarian government, e.g. Iraq.)\n\nYup, sure do.  But since I also support the constitutional requirement\nthat the government provide for the general welfare (Article I section 8),\nI'm willing to justify such programs on that basis.\n\nWell, in the first place, I don't support a "socialized economic system."\nI think within limits that capitalism is a fine idea.  But it is not\nthe case that "any third party...is...as likely to be ignorant or corrupt\nas the buyer or seller."  There are multitudes of examples where such a\nstatement is demonstrably false.  Regulation of stock market transactions\nthat provide a reasonable basis for buyers to avoid fraud is only one\nexample.\n\njsh

The article that follows was taken from the Wednesday, April 14,\n1993 issue of USA Today ("Drug Use Up At Younger Age" by Mike\nSnider, p. 1A).\n\n    Drug use is on the rise among kids as young as eighth graders -\n    usually 13 - and they're using more LSD and inhalants like glue\n    and air fresheners, says a new survey.\n\n    The annual National High School Senior Survey on Drug Abuse finds\n    "statistically significant increases" in eighth-graders' use of\n    many drugs, including marijuana, cocaine, crack, LSD and inhalants.\n\n    "We may be in danger of losing some ... hard-won ground (in reducing\n    drug use) as a new, more naive generation of youngsters enters\n    adolescence," says Lloyd Johnston, University of Michigan, chief\n    researcher on the study sponsored by the Department of Health and\n    Human Services.\n\n    But drug use among high school seniors is continuing a decade-long\n    decline.\n\n    The study of 50,000 students shows the percentage who tried the\n    following in the 30 days before they were polled:\n\n        * 8th-graders  - alcohol 26%; cigarettes 16%; marijuana 4%;\n                         cocaine 0.7%.\n\n        * 10th-graders - alcohol 40%; cigarettes 22%; marijuana 8%;\n                         cocaine 0.7%.\n\n        * 12th-graders - alcohol 51%; cigarettes 28%; marijuana 12%;\n                         cocaine 1.3%.\n\n    Among 12th-graders, use of marijuana, cocaine and inhalants\n    declined over the year before.  Not so with LSD.\n\n    * 2% of eighth-graders have tried LSD in the last year, up 24%\n    over 1991. \n\n    * Use of LSD among seniors is at its highest point since 1982; 6%\n    tried it in the last year.\n\n    Reducing drug use among students "requires a different kind of\n    strategy" that Health Secretary Donna Shalala says will be part\n    of an overall illness prevention plan.\n\n    The survey shows drugs are easier to get and fewer eighth-graders\n    disapprove of them.\n\n    "It's scary," Shalala says.  "Dealers are focusing on younger, more\n    vulnerable kids."\n\n\nScott Kennedy,  Brewer and Patriot
The word that is missing in this whole discourse is not the "B"\nword, or the "H" word, or even the "N" or "W" words. It is the "L" word -\nLOSER !!\n\n	That's right. When we boil all the crap out of this argument, it\nis all about WINNING and LOSING, and nothing else. Let me explain.\n\n	Remember the eighties ? No excuses. Nobody who can handle a mail\nbuffer can claim they are "too young" to remember Ronald Reagan - yet.\nThe eighties were about "How America Learned to Win Once Again". Then\n(wouldn't you know), we won so well that there was nothing left to win.\nNo Cold War to endure. No nuclear holocaust. No more worlds to conquer\n(We forgot about outer space long ago). The kind of overwhelming, no\nholds barred success that killed Alexander the Great. Yes, there were a\nfew "little" problems along the way - stock market meltdown here, an\nS&L bailout there, a few revolts and crazy Middle Eastern dictators to\ncontend with, but as Tacitus would tell ya', the God Augustus never had\nit so good. \n\n	In the meantime, there is guilt for winning, maybe a fear that one\ndoesn't deserve one's bounty - or success. So there is a "kinder and gentler\ntype of politician these days, Bill Clinton, affirmative action, and lots of\ndiscourse about people who "don't get it". For those of us in the winning\nbusiness, this kind of talk is mildly irritating, but there is still no \nsuggestion of losing.\n\n	But what do we find now ? To put it mildy, the stereotype of our \n"white male" non-winner is Woody Hayes in the Rose Bowl, punching out \nphotojournalists when those California fruits and nuts steal another one\nwith a "Hail Mary" pass in the Fourth Quarter. (The whole idea behind 'three\nyards and a cloud of dust' is to wear your opponent down until he collapses\nin the final period) But Woody just used his fists - Uzzies seem to be the \nweapon of choice these days. \n	\n	Who is D-FENS, anyway ? The answer is as plain as the horn rims on \nyour face. The guy is MICHAEL DOUGLAS, posing as a LOSER. This \nis known as controversial casting. But that baggy short-sleeved white shirt \nsure does look natural on Mike doesn't it. Gordon Gekko will never look the \nsame. (Though Woody always dressed that way.) Did we really expect Gekko to \ntake it easy and enjoy that kind of wardrobe, without putting up a fuss ?\n\n	What we are starting to lose sight of is, that bashing D-FENS is \nthe same game as bashing that poor African American slug that Clint Eastwood\nused to blow away all the time. As that arch-WASP (male gender) George C. Scott\ndeclaimed, "Americans traditionally LOVE TO WIN. They love a winner, and will \nnot tolerate a loser." And so on. \n\n	The political implications are simple. If, as many socialists - and\nDemocrats - do, you consider society a finite pie to a apportioned in some \n"equitable" way, then you have to worry about who is a winner and who is a \nloser to tell whose side you are on. That could be black women today, Asian\nhomosexuals tommorrow, and yes indeed, white men some yet to be determined\nday when the balance of the pie has finally swung against that (39%) \nminority.\n\n	Or you can just blow the whole thing off and say - as do most\nconservatives and all the libertarians - and act is if you didn't care\nwho's winning and who's losing. In some cases, you might say something\nabout make sure the game is fair (equality of opportunity, not of condition).\nIn the latter case, you might be able to identify yourself as a \n"neoconservative" or a "neoliberal" depending on how much you want to limit\nthe pot.\n\n	Either way you go, the way of the Winner is no longer the way to be\npopular - at least after you graduate from High School (but you'll still\nbe popular at High School reunions). But it beats being a Nerd, as I \nwould imagine Michael Douglas would now agree, and in the long run, it\nis the only way to go. (Even in Hollywood, which treats Losers worse than any\nother place in America except for New York and Washington, D.C. - and even in\nColumbus, Ohio, which produced Alex Keaton, but no champion football teams in\nthe eighties and the first quarter of the nineties) I'd like to \nsee more Winners in this society, regardless of race, gender, religious \npreference, and sexual orientation. Maybe we should even let a few more of \nthem be white men !! (We should DEFINITELY let the Buckeyes win the Rose Bowl\nsomeday)\n\n\n\nBill R.\n\n--

The Bill of Rights, as far as I can see, does not once refer to "citizens",\nbut it makes several references to "people". For example, Article IV:\n"The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers,\nand effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be\nviolated"; Article V: "no person shall be held to answer for a capital,\nor otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment by\na Grand Jury ...  nor shall any person ... be deprived of life, liberty,\nor property, without due process of law"; Article VIII: "excessive bail\nshall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual\npunishments inflicted".\n\nNow I've never heard that Constitutional rights apply only to citizens;\naren't they meant to apply equally to all *persons* living in the U.S.?\nWhether slaves were considered "not human" I don't know, but it seems\nthat a case could be made that they weren't treated as "people" as defined\nin the Bill of Rights. And since the nation is nominally based on the\nDeclaration of Independence which states that "all Men are created equal,\nthat they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights,\nthat among these are Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness",\nit would also seem that slaves would not follow under this definition\nof humanity.
An addition to anti-discrimination laws which includes homo and bisexuality\n? One would assume it would be because politicians were listening to the people\ncoming up with rational arguments rather than variations on bigotry. Logic\nsometimes prevails.\n   BTW, glad to see that you've admitted sexual attraction to children is a\nseperate sexual orientation. Didn't think you had that much honesty.

The test isn't whether GM knew--otherwise that would reward GM for its\nstupidity.  The test is whether GM reasonably should have known of their\nexistence.  It works both ways--if GM had won the trial, and the plaintiff\nturned up two witnesses who came forward after the first trial who should\nhave been located beforehand, too bad, so sad--no new trial.\n\nLike Tim said, you don't get a new civil trial because you screwed up \nthe first time around.

^^^^^^^^^\n\n\nMaybe we should ask the 83,103 people who were laid off this January whether\nor not we're in a recession. That was a figure that was reported in the\nNew York Times.

Canada's GST is collected as a sales tax and is considered a VAT.\nFunnily, the previous hidden wholesale tax that it replaces was\nnever referred to as a tax (or, people never paid mind to it,\nthus the uproar when it was brought up front as the GST --- \none party has actually campaigned on hiding the tax again).\n\nThe stated intent of the Tories was to use the GST to write down\nour deficit.  Unfortunately, their legislation didn't include any\nmechanism for disbursing the collected funds in such a manner and\nthe money is now sitting in escrow.  I don't know what is involved\nin releasing the funds, but one dilemna is that the Tories are not\nfiscal conservatives themselves though while taxing and spending,\nthey've made moves to apply the breaks to a runaway locomotive by\nthe end of this time --- the end of their second term (~9 years).\nWhile they do have chances of getting a third term, catching up\nin the polls to their more moderate/slightly leftish pro-business\nrivals, the Liberals (as in Euro/UK), the Tories' heir-apparent \nfor the leaders' mantle has been termed a clone of Hillary \nClinton ...\n\ngld

[...]\n\n\nYou seem to be saying that a LIMITED government will provide MORE\nopportunities for private interests to use it to pursue their own\nagendas, and asking libertarians to prove that this will NOT happen.\nWhile I can't offer such a proof, it seems pretty damn plausible that\nif the government does not regulate a particular area, it cannot become\na tool of private interests to pursue their own agendas in that area.\nI rather suspect that it's the sort of government we have NOW that is\nmore likely to become such a tool, and that it IS such a tool in many\ninstances.\n\n\nI suspect that this is because "improvement in the human condition" as\nyou define it is not the primary goal of libertarianism, and would not\nbe the primary goal of a libertarian government.

In responding to the post below I have considered issues far outside the\nscope of revisionism and principally have considered the political\nimplications of a racist ideology and its inevitable outcome. Thus it\nis tangentially relevant to soc.history and alt.revisionism but I have directed\nfollowups to t.p.m since it is principally consideration of the political\nlessons to be drawn from the history of the NAZI party that I deal with.\n\n\n\n\nLet us assume for the sake of argument that this was indeed the case? Does\nthis mean that Hilter would have been in any way less guilty of mass murder\nbecause he aquiesced rather than participated as an active and ardent\nsupporter?\n\nOne of the important things to realise about the NAZIs is that the system\nwas far more evil than any single member. Once created the NAZI party\nitself was a murder machine that would inevitably commit genocide, there was\nnoone within it strong enough to prevent it. Remember that Hitler did not\noriginaly lead the NAZI party nor was he particularly powerful within it\nuntil his oratory allowed the party to come to power. Had Hitler reneged\nupon the emotiaonal expectations which he had created within the ranks of \nhis supporters he would have been replaced as he had himself replaced the\nold guard who he beleived were unable to grasp the intellectual implications\nof their rhetoric. \n\nThis is why all parties that espouse NAZI style race supremacy ideologies must\nbe considered as dangerous and as evil as the NAZIs. The idea that one "race"\nof people is inherently superior to another and that the greatest goal of\nhumanity is to achieve racial perfection has only one logical outcome,\nthe gas chambers of Auschwitz.\n\nThe NAZI party is not simply the tale of a supremely evil single man who\nlead an entire country astray, beyond the evil of individuals there was the\nevil of the system itself which was self generating and self perpetuating.\nHitler was an extreemly evil person who built his party arround an ego\ncult centered on the demonstration of his own power, this does not however\nmean that he was as entirely free from political constraints as he and\nhis propagandists worked so hard to assert. The myth that racism can\nproduce a strong government that can cure a nations ills must be \nemphatically rejected. In the same way we must accept a distinction between\na govenrment that demonstrates its strength and one that is able to \ngovern decisively in the manner it beleives is best. I would accept only the\nlatter as a "strong" government since most displays of strength are made\nnecessary by an essential weakness.\n\nIt is important to understand that the NAZIs were not stupid nor were they\namoral in the sense that they lacked moral scruples. They acted in the\nsame manner as the Spanish Inquisition - murder and torture in the cause\nof morality. The fault of the NAZIs lies in their axioms, not in their\nlogic nor in their implementation of those axioms. Thus all such parties\nsuch as the National Front or David Dukes Klu Klux Klan front who assert\nthe truth of those axioms must be considered for what they are, advocates\nof a system that would commit genocide. \n\nThe conclusion that Hitler was not only responsible but imensely evil is\ninescapable from the historical record. It is important though to not let\nthe conclusion be reached that the NAZIs espoused a set of ideas that\nwere basically correct but had an unfortunate proponent. The evils of\nthe concept of race supremacy are primary. Although this most emphaticaly\ndoes not excuse individual culpability this is nevertheless secondary.\n\nNo matter what the promises made by a racist, supremacist party upon \nelection those promises will be broken as soon as circumstances permit.\nIf this requires the replacement of the leaders that originally made\nthe pledges, that will occur. Hatred is a supreme justifier. It also creates\na dynamic of its own when those in government allow it reign. For many\nin government politics is a method of providing a justification for\ntheir own existence through a demonstration of their importance. A \nrhetoric of hatred inevitably develops the question of action since the\ncontinued existence of an object of hatred is inevitably a reminder of the\nessential impotence of the politician. Thus we have the US raid on Tripoli\nwhich has little purpose beyond a demonstration of power. It is important\nto realise that there is no quantum jump between the politics of the right\nand those of the extreeme right but a progression from the reinforcement\nof popular predjudice to action being taken on the basis of that predjudice.\nIn the same way the extreeme left trace their route to despotism through\ntheir assertion of the subjugation of the individual to ideology.\n\nIt is important though that in attempting to understand the dynamics\nof political systems that this is not used to excuse the participants. The\nleaders of a nation take on a supreme moral burden but not only do\nso voluntarily are required to stive to do so. Thus to take on such a \ntask without a fundamental examination of the logical progression of\nones set of axioms to its conclusion in itself is a moral crime. Furthermore\nin taking on such a duty one is obliged to put the interest of the whole\nbefore personal concerns, even of personal security.\n\nAlthough it was inevitable that a party such as the NAZIs, based upon hatred\nand an idolisation of the symbols of power should have saught to commit\ngenocide it was not inevitable that they should succeeded. Each member of\nthe system had an ability to create a change within it that had a possibility\nof changing the dynamic. Realising that the individual cannot hope to \ncontrol a system does not mean accepting that the individual cannot \naffect the system.

Ahhh, the classic Truth By Blatant Assertion technique.  Too bad it's\nso demonstrably false.  Take a look at Great Britain sometime for a \nnice history on drug criminalization.  The evidence there shows that\nduring periods of time when drugs (such as heroin) were illegal, crime\nwent up and people did die from bad drugs.  During times when drugs\nwere legalized, those trends were reversed.\n\n\nNow this is a great example of an ironclad proof.  Gosh, I'm convinced.\n( :-} for the humor impaired).  First, assert something for which you\nhave no evidence, then dodge requests for proof by claiming to know\nwhat this group was intended for.  As to research, if you'd done any\nat all, you'd realize that there is plenty of reason to believe that\nlegalizing drugs will have many benefits to society.  There are some\nplausible arguments against it, too, but they aren't enough to convince\nme that criminalization of drugs is the answer.  I'm willing to be\nconvinced I'm wrong, but I seriously doubt the likes of you can do it.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n...Dale Cook    "Any town having more churches than bars has a serious\n                   social problem." ---Edward Abbey\nThe opinions are mine only (i.e., they are NOT my employer's)

Fine.  Libertarians and anarchists are not alone in being uncomfortable\nwith the use of state sponsored coercion.  The notion that coercion can\nbe virtually eliminated in a society (or more properly that once it is\neliminated on the part of the state it is no longer worth serious \nconsideration) is a view that is peculiar to libertarians and anarchists.  \n\nFor example, does "non-initiated force" (coercion) include tax collection?\nDoes it include the minimal level of regulation of commerce envisioned\nby Adam Smith?  Since coercion can be exercised by actors other than the\nstate, how is the state to deal with it?  Exclusively through after the\nfact arbitration/legal compulsion?  \n\n\nWell, I must admit that the picture of libertarians as Amway participants\nis somewhat more reassuring than the idea of them trying to govern a \ncomplex, conflictual, industrial society.  I'd venture to point out, \nhowever, that if libertarians couldn't convince at least 85% of a group \nof "seminar participants" to "embrace" their philosophy, their \npropaganda skills need to be honed.  \n\nFrankly, however, it is no great trick to create a government for a \nsociety in which (almost) everyone is assumed to agree about what is a proper\ngovernment policy.  Once that is assumed, all sorts of annoying formalities\ncan be dispensed with, elections, police, etc.  And as Mr. Marx said,\nthe state will just wither away.  \n\nOn the way there, however, would you like to explain how eliminating \nvirtually all policies that restrain private coercion in the \ncurrent society will help us to live happier lives? Or is it like\nsocialism; just some short-term pain that we'll have to bear until \neveryone has had the benefit of "re-education" through regular \n"seminar" training?\n\njsh

Shall we criminalize\nalcohol again? If the re-legalization for alcohol were done from\nanything other than the pragmatic standpoint, I'd be happy to hear \nabout it. The fact is that it wasn't.\n\n\n  Only the first one make any sense. There is nothing to "legalize"\nabout all the rest. Just in case you haven't made the connection \n(which I expect you haven't) the connecting theme in this thread is\na persons autonomy over their life and body. Vice statutes serve\nonly to make it more expensive for the rich and more dangerous\nfor the poor, as Tim so eloquently put it. People will, however,\ntake autonomy over their lives, regardless of what the government\nsays.\n  And why, pray tell, is AIDS "victim" in snear quotes?

Encouraging people to snoop on one another\n   and report transgressions against the almighty state, which most\n   Americans deplored in Nazi or communist regimes..." \n\n   "... Although most Americans paid no income tax at all 50 years ago\n   -- withholding began only during World War II, as a "temporary"\n   exigency, and in 1948 the median family federal income tax was $9..."\n\n   "Last year the federal government got only 37 percent of its income\n    from income taxes... How long ago was it that the federal government\n    somehow managed to stagger along on 63 percent of its 1992 revenue?\n    ... Would you believe five?..."
Oh, you foolish person.  I do know what the fuck I'm talking about\nand will gladly demonstrate for such ignorants as yourself if you\nwish.\n\nThe legalization of drugs will provide few if any of the benefits\nso highly taunted by its proponents:  safer, cheaper drugs along\nwith revenues from taxes on those drugs; reduced crime and reduced\norganized crime specifically; etc, etc\n\nIf you would like to prove how clueless you are, we can get into\nwhy - again a lot of wasted posts that I don't think this group\nwas intended for and something easily solved by you doing a little\nresearch.\n\n\n\n\n\nMaking you look bad is too damn easy.  The vast social and historical\ndifferences between alcohol and other drugs make this comparison\nworthless.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd so it shall be if the government (by the people) decides that\nthese vices are detrimental to the society as a whole.
)\n)\n)>The official and legal term for rape is "the crime of forcing a FEMALE \n)>to submit to sexual intercourse."\n)\n)Please, supply me with some references.  I was not aware that all states\n)had the word "FEMALE" in the rape statutes.  I am sure others are surprised\n)as well.  I know thats how it works in practice (nice-n-fair, NOT!!), but\n)was unaware that it was in the statutes as applying to FEMALES only,\n)uniformly throughout the U.S.\n\nI agree mostly with Chris.  It is (unfortunately, IMO) true that the *FBI*\nfigures for rape based on the 'uniform crime report' report only female\nrapes. However, some states (such as Illinois) are not tabluated because they\nrefuse to comply with this sexist definition!
In the case of victimless crimes yes, I think so.\n\nThink about it.  If I rob or beat up or rape or kill someone, it's very\nclear to anyone not a sociopath that I've done something immoral.  On the\nother hand, if I smoke grass or have sex with a consenting adult in a\nmanner illegal in that state, the morality or immorality of that act is\nmerely a lifestyle choice; it doesn;t clearly hurt anyone else.  IMO, if\nsuch an act doesn;t hurt another person it should not be interfered with.\n\n\nI think so.  And I don't use drugs, outside of the legal ones (alcohol\nand coffee).
In case you haven't noticed, Clintonites are pushing a universal health\n    care ACCESS program.  "Access" here means that folks who do not give \n    a damn about immunizing their children will have health care services\n    delivered to their doorsteps.\n\n\n-- \n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed are mine, not my employer's.

THE WHITE HOUSE\n\n                  Office of the Press Secretary\n                   (Pittsburgh, Pennslyvania)\n______________________________________________________________\nFor Immediate Release                         April 17, 1993     \n\n             \n                  RADIO ADDRESS TO THE NATION \n                        BY THE PRESIDENT\n             \n                Pittsburgh International Airport\n                    Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania\n             \n             \n10:06 A.M. EDT\n             \n             \n             THE PRESIDENT:  Good morning.  My voice is coming to\nyou this morning through the facilities of the oldest radio\nstation in America, KDKA in Pittsburgh.  I'm visiting the city to\nmeet personally with citizens here to discuss my plans for jobs,\nhealth care and the economy.  But I wanted first to do my weekly\nbroadcast with the American people. \n             \n             I'm told this station first broadcast in 1920 when\nit reported that year's presidential elections.  Over the past\nseven decades presidents have found ways to keep in touch with\nthe people, from whistle-stop tours to fire-side chats to the bus\ntour that I adopted, along with Vice President Gore, in last\nyear's campaign.\n             \n             Every Saturday morning I take this time to talk with\nyou, my fellow Americans, about the problems on your minds and\nwhat I'm doing to try and solve them.  It's my way of reporting\nto you and of giving you a way to hold me accountable.\n             \n             You sent me to Washington to get our government and\neconomy moving after years of paralysis and policy and a bad\nexperiment with trickle-down economics.  You know how important\nit is for us to make bold, comprehensive changes in the way we do\nbusiness.  \n             \n             We live in a competitive global economy.  Nations\nrise and fall on the skills of their workers, the competitiveness\nof their companies, the imagination of their industries, and the\ncooperative experience and spirit that exists between business,\nlabor and government.  Although many of the economies of the\nindustrialized world are now suffering from slow growth, they've\nmade many of the smart investments and the tough choices which\nour government has for too long ignored.  That's why many of them\nhave been moving ahead and too many of our people have been\nfalling behind.\n             \n             We have an economy today that even when it grows is\nnot producing new jobs.  We've increased the debt of our nation\nby four times over the last 12 years, and we don't have much to\nshow for it.  We know that wages of most working people have\nstopped rising, that most people are working longer work weeks\nand that too many families can no longer afford the escalating\ncost of health care.\n             \n             But we also know that, given the right tools, the\nright incentives and the right encouragement, our workers and\nbusinesses can make the kinds of products and profits our economy\nneeds to expand opportunity and to make our communities better\nplaces to live.\n             \n             In many critical products today Americans are the\nlow cost, high quality producers.  Our task is to make sure that\nwe create more of those kinds of jobs.\n             \n             Just two months ago I gave Congress my plan for\nlong-term jobs and economic growth.  It changes the old\npriorities in Washington and puts our emphasis where it needs to\nbe -- on people's real needs, on increasing investments and jobs\nand education, on cutting the federal deficit, on stopping the\nwaste which pays no dividends, and redirecting our precious\nresources toward investment that creates jobs now and lays the\ngroundwork for robust economic growth in the future.\n             \n             These new directions passed the Congress in record\ntime and created a new sense of hope and opportunity in our\ncountry.  Then the jobs plan I presented to Congress, which would\ncreate hundreds of thousands of jobs, most of them in the private\nsector in 1993 and 1994, passed the House of Representatives.  It\nnow has the support of a majority of the United States Senate. \nBut it's been held up by a filibuster of a minority in the\nSenate, just 43 senators.  They blocked a vote that they know\nwould result in the passage of our bill and the creation of jobs.\n             \n             The issue isn't politics; the issue is people. \nMillions of Americans are waiting for this legislation and\ncounting on it, counting on us in Washington.  But the jobs bill\nhas been grounded by gridlock.  \n             \n             I know the American people are tired of business as\nusual and politics as usual.  I know they don't want us to spin\nor wheels.  They want the recovery to get moving.  So I have\ntaken a first step to break this gridlock and gone the extra\nmile.  Yesterday I offered to cut the size of this plan by 25\npercent -- from $16 billion to $12 billion.  \n             \n             It's not what I'd hoped for.  With 16 million\nAmericans looking for full-time work, I simply can't let the bill\nlanguish when I know that even a compromise bill will mean\nhundreds of thousands of jobs for our people.  The mandate is to\nact to achieve change and move the country forward.  By taking\nthis initiative in the face of an unrelenting Senate talkathon, I\nthink we can respond to your mandate and achieve a significant\nportion of our original goals.\n             \n             First, we want to keep the programs as much as\npossible that are needed to generate jobs and meet human needs,\nincluding highway and road construction, summer jobs for young\npeople, immunization for children, construction of waste water\nsites, and aid to small businesses.  We also want to keep funding\nfor extended unemployment compensation benefits, for people who\nhave been unemployed for a long time because the economy isn't\ncreating jobs.\n             \n             Second, I've recommended that all the other programs\nin the bill be cut across-the-board by a little more than 40\npercent.\n             \n             And third, I've recommended a new element in this\nprogram to help us immediately start our attempt to fight against\ncrime by providing $200 million for cities and towns to rehire\npolice officers who lost their jobs during the recession and put\nthem back to work protecting our people.  I'm also going to fight\nfor a tough crime bill because the people of this country need it\nand deserve it.\n             \n             Now, the people who are filibustering this bill --\nthe Republican senators -- say they won't vote for it because it\nincreases deficit spending, because there's extra spending this\nyear that hasn't already been approved.  That sounds reasonable,\ndoesn't it?  Here's what they don't say.  This program is more\nthan paid for by budget cuts over my five-year budget, and this\nbudget is well within the spending limits already approved by the\nCongress this year.\n             \n             It's amazing to me that many of these same senators\nwho are filibustering the bill voted during the previous\nadministration for billions of dollars of the same kind of\nemergency spending, and much of it was not designed to put the\nAmerican people to work.  \n             \n             This is not about deficit spending.  We have offered\na plan to cut the deficit.  This is about where your priorities\nare -- on people or on politics.  \n             \n             Keep in mind that our jobs bill is paid for dollar\nfor dollar.  It is paid for by budget cuts.  And it's the\nsoundest investment we can now make for ourselves and our\nchildren.  I urge all Americans to take another look at this jobs\nand investment program; to consider again the benefits for all of\nus when we've helped make more American partners working to\nensure the future of our nation and the strength of our economy.\n             \n             You know, if every American who wanted a job had\none, we wouldn't have a lot of the other problems we have in this\ncountry today.  This bill is not a miracle, it's a modest first\nstep to try to set off a job creation explosion in this country\nagain.  But it's a step we ought to take.  And it is fully paid\nfor over the life of our budget.\n             \n             Tell your lawmakers what you think.  Tell them how\nimportant the bill is.  If it passes, we'll all be winners.\n             \n             Good morning, and thank you for listening.
it may be a little late to reply to your tirade and also on an inaapropriate\nboard but along with all of the so called great things the white male has done they have also contributed to society by means of mass genocide, the theft of\nideas and cultures, creating and the perptration of historical lies throughouttime among many other horrible activities.\nbut every culture has its upside and its downside.  it seems to me that the \nwhite male (must be extremely ignorant to qualify for the following - if\nyou're not disregard) and western culture are the only things that look to \nactively classify things as good or bad, worthy or unworthy (ya dig)\nit can be seen with slavery and the manipulation and destruction of the \namerican indians civilization.  nothing but selfish acts that benefit one \ngroup of people (and not even their women get or got respected or regarded as\nequal - ain't that some stuff)\n\nwhite men - not being specific - but in a lot of cases are just wack or have\nwack conceptions of how the world is to serve their purpose.  \n\njust look at david koresh - throughout history (i may be shortsighted on this one so excuse my predjudiced ignorance) only white men associate themselves withbeing GOD.  no other culture is ignorant or arrogant enough to assume such a \nposition.  and then to manipulate and mislead all those people.\n\nhmmm...  i'd say look in your history books but since it seems that history \nhas been written to glorify the exploits of white men you'd only find lies.\n\nawww that's enough already from me because this has nothing to do with sex or this board.  if ya'd like to continue this discussion e-mail me and we can \ncompare and contrast ideas\n\n			i like conflict - it's educational when the \n			communcation is good......................\n\nmy $.02 worth\n\n(i apologize to those who thought this was going to be about SEX but i was\nprompted by a response i found up here)
If we had backed him strongly early on I doubt there would be the\nproblem there is now.  Many Russians became disillusioned with democracy\nand reforms when they felt, rightly IMO, that the West didn't care.\n\nYeltsin was virtually promised massive aid (once Bush got over his\nGorby-mania.)  This probably kept him from dismantling the congress\nand calling for new elections.  Well, the aid didn't come through\nand we didn't make sure it went to the proper places and now the\nanti-reformers are gaining strength where before they were in\nhiding.\n\n\nIf they don't reform I don't believe in giving them money.  However,\nI think this is too important to take a non-interventionist approach.\nThis is what really bugs me about Libertarianism -- it sounds like\n'it'll all be the same in a hundred years time.  no need to do\nanything.'\n\nDespite the wishes of Libertarians, this society is a far way, and getting\nfarther, from being Libertarian.  Perhaps voluntary gifts would work if\nwe had the proper framework but we do not have it.  We have to face the\nproblem *now*, not in X years when we have a Libertarian dream society.\n\nRight now there are huge stumbling blocks to trade, let alone charity.\nThere are still limitations to high-tech exports.  NASA can't buy\nProton launch vehicles from them.  Sure, the market may be able to\nhelp a great deal but it can't right now.  There are too many obstacles.\nInstead of fighting against the aid you should be fighting to \ntear down the obstacles the market and charities have to face.\n\nWell, I think limited government is primarily democratic due\nto it being limited.  But the main question is how do you transform\na state-run economy and monolithic government into something that\neven remotely looks like ours?  (BTW, sometimes it seems that our government \nis trying to go the opposite direction)  It is not going to be\npainless and not going to be easy.  We simply cannot wait to\nhelp when they *have* the 'proper' government.  They'll never\nget there without the aid.  It may be too late already.\n\n\nAnd I'm just excercising mine.\n\n\nAs I also said above, another problem I have is with *transformation*.\nA Libertarian society is not going to happen painlessly or overnight.\nI have seen nothing about how to take our current government and\nsociety and turn it into a minimal government and a responsible\nself-sufficient populace.  \n\n\nThey didn't have nuclear weapons 100 years ago.  Nor instantaneous\ncommunications nor travel to virtually anyplace on the earth in\nless than a day.\n\n\nYes, depend on the rulers of the free market and the businesses.  Rulers\ndo emerge *somewhere* and they will never represent the opinions of\nevery person on the planet.  \n\nThere must be checks and balances.  Checks on the government when\nit gets out of bounds and checks on industry when it gets out of\nbounds.  Putting all your hopes on the benevolence of the market\nis, to me, just like putting all your hopes on the benevolence of\ngovernment.
This was in Wed. WSJ.\n\n[start]\nThe white house, seeking to mount public pressure on GOP senators, bombarded\nnews outlets in some senator's home states with news releases warning that\ncertain projects may not be funded if the $16billion stimulus bill isn't\npassed.\n\nNone of the projects mentioned are actually in the bill, rather they are\npart of a wish list that may be funded from the $2.56 billion in\nCommunity Development Block Grants.\n\n...\n\n[end]\n\nI could have sworn I heard a bunch of Clintonites going on and on, raving\nabout how dishonest it was that the Rebublicans were taking items from this\nwish list in order to ridicule this bill. Now that Clinton is using that\nsame list in order to garner support for the bill, are you guys going to\ndo the honarable thing and say that Clinton is being dishonest.
And we all hope, Teddy, that you will graduate from the first grade\nwhile Clinton is President. Keep trying.

This is a very good point.  One that I have held for sometime.  We do not\nallow people to develop on the paths that they choose or desire.

Some tape archivists suggest what they were after had something to do with\nthe Kennedy assasination. Let's hear all of the tapes real soon, shall we?
tes:\n\nFirst, the only drug that could possibly be put in drug stations are marijuana \nor its derivitives.  Every other drug that I can think of can kill you if you \ntake to much.  (By the very nature of these drugs, your decision making skills \naren't up to par.  That is how it differs from asprin, flinstone vitamins, etc.\nWe don't even allow penicilin to be sold over the counter.)\n\nSecond, we already have a big enough drunk driving and alchoholic problem in \nthis country.  If marijuana were legal, undoubtedly more people would use it, \nand that IS a problem.  People use it, get stupid, and hurt other people.
I don't know where YOU live, but this is not the case nationawide.\nPerhaps your state or municipality has put together the funds to \ndo so, but in my area and most areas where I know people, immunizations\ncost $$$.\n\nSorry to shatter your stereotypes.
s,\n\nThis country is hardly ruined. In fact, it is booming compared to after the\n1980 election.\n\nThis whole "USA has gone to hell and Reagan/Bush caused it", is not only lame,\npathetic, and old....... it's wrong.\n\nUnder Reagan/Bush the economy grew by 1.1 trillion dollars.  This is more than \nthe entire economy of Germany, a "kind, gentle" country, in many peoples' \nbooks.  What a joke.
The Republicans are, in general, fighting any tax increase.\nThere is also worry that a VAT would be far too easy to increase\nincrementally.\n\n       (BTW, what is different between Canada's tax and most of\nEurope's that makes it "visible?")\n\n\n       This would require a constitutional amendment, and Congress\nenjoys raising taxes too much to restrict themselves like that.\n(Besides, with the 2/3 majority necessary to pull that off you'd \nhave a difficult time "forcing" anything like that.)\n\n\n       Primarily because it's a practical impossibility to "freeze"\ntax rates.\n\n       However, this is something that bothers me.  We're always talking\nabout "consumer confidence" and "consumer spending" as gauges for the\neconomy.

A judge denied GM's new trial motion, even though GM says it has two\nnew witnesses that said the occupant of the truck was dead from the impact, not\nfrom the fire.\n\n	Thoughts?\n\n	It's kind of scary when you realize that judges are going to start\ndenying new trials even when new evidence that contradicts the facts that led\nto the previous ruling appear.\n\n	Or has the judge decided that the new witnesses are not to be believed? \nShouldn't that be up to a jury?\n\n	And what about members of the previous jury parading through the talk\nshows proclaiming their obvious bias against GM?  Shouldn't that be enough for\na judge to through out the old verdict and call for a new trial?\n\n	Whatever happened to jurors having to be objective?

Those areas became states.\n\nPuerto Rico has the population needed to become a state.  But the ethnic\nmix there is such that Puerto Rico will probably never become a state.\n\nI say we cut them loose.  If they don't want to become a state, we\nshouldn't continue to subsidize their existence.
ri\n\n\n\nI do agree with you, in a way.  The war on drugs has failed, but in my opinion,\nthat doesn't mean we have to give up.  Only change the tactics.\n\nFor instance, here are how some penalties should be changed.\n\nDealing Coke -- Death\nDealing Heroin -- Death\nDealing Pot -- Death\nDealing Crack -- Death\n\nThe list goes on and on!!!......\n\nJUST KIDDING!!!\n\nHowever, on a more serious note, I do believe that we should take some money \naway from the foriegn operations in South America and costly border \ninterdiction efforts.  (Don't think I'm going to say, "spend it to educate \npeople", because I know plenty of educated dopers).  Actually, spend it on  \nthings like drug treatment programs.\n\nI saw an interesting story on 60 minutes about how the British actually \nprescribe and addict his "recommended" dosage, and try to ween him off from it,\nor cut the amount down to levels where it is "acceptable".  Sounds good so far \nfrom what I heard with a decrease in cost, lower addiction rates by wiping out \nthe dealer's markets, etc. (But that was the only thing I have heard about it.)\n\nHowever, legalizing it and just sticking some drugs in gas stations to be \nbought like cigarettes is just plain silly.  Plus, I have never heard of a \nrecommended dosage for drugs like crack, ecstasy, chrystal meth and LSD.\nThe 60 Minute Report said it worked with "cocaine" cigarettes, pot and heroin.
# #The argument that "slavery was a dying institution" was often made by\n# 						     ^^^\n# 						     (IS)\n# \n# #historians, mainly Southerners, who sought to divert attention from the \n# #institution as the central issue of the Civil War.  In fact, however,\n# #the argument is specious, at best.  More recent scholarship from the \n# #last 20-30 years demonstrates rather conclusively that the cotton/sugar/\n# #tobacco economy and its reliance on slavery was increasingly dominant in \n# #the South prior to the Civil War.\n# \n# This is because the South did not receive the massive momentum of capital\n#  intensive growth that the Northern states did. Compare the Northern\n#  agricultural system with the Southern and you will see a major difference \n#  in the capital to labor intensity.\n\nCapital and labor are one and the same in a slave economy.  Except that\ncapital doesn't reproduce quite as readily as slaves did.\n\nSlavery was a dying institution before the cotton gin, yes, but not\nin 1850.\n\n# #It is true that cotton suffered from price depression in the 1840's -\n# #the period used to claim that slavery would not have lasted in the \n# #South.  \n# \n# That is not the argument that I have heard. It would not have lasted because\n#  the growth in the North would not have been sustained for much longer without\n#  spilling over to the Southern states, i.e. Northern industry would have \n#  migrated capital to the Southern states, and with that would have come \n#  immigrant labor to the ports of the South, e.g. Charleston, Savannah, Mobile,\n#  New Orleans, etc. This would have put the breaks on the slave market and\n#  slavery would have been out-moded by the capital intensity of competing \n#  agriculturalists. Those that insisted on keeping slaves because of their\n#  "Cruel Hearts and Hatred for Black People" would have been driven out of\n#  business. Simple capital to labor ratio...read Michael Parkin _Microeconomics_\n#  2nd edition, and any other basic economics book.\n\nThis assumes that the slave holder dominance over state governments\nwould not have caused the passage of laws to keep out capital from the\nNorth.  Since slave holders were prepared to do almost anything else\nto destroy free markets in order to maintain slavery, I do not doubt\nthat they would have passed laws to cripple any serious competitive\nthreat.  Thomas Sowell's _Market and Minorities_ argues that the\nmaintenance of slavery, and the costs it imposed on state and local\ngovernments, discouraged not only capital formation, but also outside\ncapital investment in the Southern states.\n\n# 	Craig A.

From article <C4zLJ8.Bun@queernet.org>, by rogerk@queernet.org (Roger B.A. Klorese):\n\n#>NAMBLA's presence in the SF Gay Pride Parade says quite a bit.\n#>It says that either the parade organizers want to show support\n#>for NAMBLA, or they themselves have a fundamental misunderstanding\n#>of their rights and responsibilities.  I would really, really like\n#>to believe the latter, but I would need some help to do so.\n\n\nPerhaps, though the exclusion of the Gay Perotistas in the\nSF Gay Pride Parade would make me think that they had some\nclue in this regard.

Replying to A.J. Teel:\n\n	Well, the two nifty letters giving concrete proof that the\n	Income Tax is voluntary and giving specific procedures for\n	stopping withholding, et cetera have been out there for a\n	while now.\n\nHumbug.  Those letters don't provide "concrete proof" of anything at all\nin the absence of any case law that demonstrates the method will actu-\nally work for ordinary people in everyday situations.\n\nSpecifically, show us some case law in which the courts have ruled that\nincome tax is illegal and/or that ordinary working types do not have to\npay income tax (and that they can legally avoid paying income tax with-\nout declaring themselves to be churches or some such silliness).  This\nissue is sufficiently important that I think we have a right to expect\nsomething squarely on point from the US Supreme Court (in the case of\nfederal tax) or a state's supreme court (for a state's income tax).\n\nUnless you can do that, I for one am unwilling to call your material\n"concrete proof".\n\n	There has been no refutation to date.  Have the nay-sayers\n	finally given up as defeated?  Sure would like to hear their\n	reasons for disbelief at this point.\n\nRefutation??  Refutation of what?  You haven't made a case yet.  You've\nposted plenty of claims, but you haven't given us any valid reason to\nbelieve that any court in the US will agree with you.  Your claims seem\non the surface to deviate so radically from the legal mainstream that I\nfeel the burden of proof is still on =you= to show that your arguments\nhave any merit whatsoever.  And the cases you've cited involve such\nstrange situations that I see no reason to assume that the rulings are\napplicable to anyone else, or that they will ultimately stand on appeal\nto the Supreme Court.\n\nWhy can't you just cite us a case in which Joe Schmoe, a regular\nemployee earning regular wages from a regular company, refuses to pay\nhis income tax, gets hauled into court, is convicted of wilful tax eva-\nsion, and then has his conviction overturned by the US Supreme Court\nwith a landmark 7-2 majority ruling that income tax is indeed totally\nvoluntary?  What, you say?  No such case exists?  Hmmm, I wonder why\nnot; why haven't you?\n\n	Shall I conclude that the point has been received and the\n	opposition has forfeited the field?\n\nWith all due respect, you can conclude anything you want.  I just hope,\nfor your own sake, that you don't conclude that anyone in a position of\nauthority in the United States or any legitimate or illegitimate polit-\nical subdivision thereof is going to agree with your conclusions.\n\nFor that matter, I confess I'm thoroughly confused as to =why= you would\nbe looking for court rulings in your favor anyway -- since I thought you\ntold us earlier that every court in the US has been in cahoots with big\nbanking interests since the 1938 "admiralty jurisdiction" coverup thing.\nDo you honestly expect us to believe that they'd go to all the trouble\nto subvert the system, and yet would still promptly slink back into\ntheir burrows in the face of anyone who knew enough to invoke the right\ncombination of magic spells and mystic mumbo-jumbo?\n\nNot only that, but why do you even =care= what the US courts say anyway?\nDidn't you tell us a while back that you've disavowed all attempts by US\nofficials to classify you as a "14th Amendment federal citizen"?  When\nthe FBI comes to haul you away for tax evasion, why don't you just tell\nthem they're out of their jurisdiction and should go back to Washington,\nD.C., where they belong?\n\nOr maybe we should all just go back to mediaeval common law, which you\nsuggested would be better than all these statutes, codes, and the like.\nIf you want to renounce society's legal framework, fine; we can just\ndeclare you an outlaw, OK?, and anyone who sees you driving on the roads\nwith no license plate on your car and no driver's license in your wallet\ncan just take you like a game animal and stew you for their supper (with\nplenty of veggies and a pinch of salt, but WITHOUT PREJUDICE UCC 1-207).\n\nSorry, everyone, it's getting late, and I'm sick and tired of all this\ngarbage.  If I know what's good for me, I'll just clam up and stop try-\ning to refute this nonsense, and if anyone falls for it and winds up in\njail for tax evasion or what-not, it'll be on their own head.\n\nNeedless to say, none of the above represents the opinions of my current\nemployer -- who, in any case, is a Canadian and doesn't really need to\ncare too much about US tax law.  I, on the other hand, am a "14th Amend-\nment federal citizen", with a US passport to prove it, and plan to keep\non filing Form 1040's for the foreseeable future (though I will probably\nnot owe any US income tax due to the foreign earned income exclusion\nand/or the foreign tax credit).

Here is a press release from the Reserve Officers Association.\n\n Reserve Officers Say Demographics Ignored in Nominations to\nClose Naval, Marine Reserve Centers\n To: National Desk, Defense Writer\n Contact: Herbert M. Hart of the Reserve Officers Association of\n          the United States, 202-479-2258\n\n   WASHINGTON, April 13 /U.S. Newswire/ -- The Reserve Officers\nAssociation of the United States has alerted the Defense Base\nRealignment and Closure Commission that the services failed to give\nsufficient weight to demographics in recommendations made to close\n56 Naval and Marine Corps Reserve centers.\n   In letters to the closure commission and to all 86 members of\nCongress with affected locations in their constituencies, including\nSen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.), chairman of the Senate Armed Services\nCommittee, ROA charged that the developers of the Navy-Marine list\nignored demographics of the civilian population, particularly prior\nservice personnel.\n   ROA's executive director, Maj. Gen. Evan L. Hultman, AUS (Ret.),\nsuggested "concern that the only plausible alternative is that they\nare intentionally attempting to foreclose the Naval Reserve\ncomponents from maintaining even today's relatively low level of\nparticipation in their parent service's Total Force of the future."\n   He asked the commission "to remove from consideration all\nlocations without sufficient and convincing demographic data to\nwarrant approval of the requested action."\n   "Only a few of the 56 Naval and Marine Corps Reserve\ninstallations on this list are large enough to have a significant\nimpact on the community, if closed," wrote Hultman.  "The major\nissue is the cumulative impact of moving or closing such a large\npercentage of the existing locations."\n   Hultman reminded the commission, "The fact that the vast\nmajority of the Reserve installations on this list do not come\nclose to meeting the minimal requirements for consideration in this\nprocess certainly supports the thesis" that these actions are\nsimply an attempt to foreclose a substantial role for the Navy and\nMarine Corps Reserve.\n   ROA also noted "that at the end of the 1960s, when the number of\nNaval Reservists was approximately the same as today, there were 480\nNaval Reserve facilities.  If the Navy recommendations are\napproved, there will be less than 200 Naval Reserve facilities."\n   Facilities on the list include seven Naval Air Stations ranging\nfrom South Weymouth, Mass., to Alameda, Calif., 28 Naval\nReserve Centers in Macon, Ga., and Parkersburg, W.Va., to\nMissoula and Great Falls. Mont.  Naval/Marine Corps Reserve\nCenters include four in San Francisco, Fort Wayne, Ind.,\nBillings, Mont., and Abilene, Texas.\n   A major Marine Reserve Center on the list is that at El\nToro, Calif., plus six others.\n -30-

Excellently put!\n\nEven as a libertarian, I have to admit government does do some things I\nlike.  There is a beautiful performing arts complex in Ft.  Lauderdale\nthat was partially built with tax dollars (I don't know how much was\nprivate and how much was stolen, I mean public) but it is beautiful and\nI enjoy it.  (Keep in mind, though, most of the people in the city will\nnever attend a single performance there, so they might feel differently\nabout having to help pay for it.)\n\nHowever, I have to disagree about it being desireable or efficient to\ngive government intervention-power on a case-by-case basis.  In fact,\nwe have a lot better luck maintaining our freedom of speech precisely\nbecause it is not decided on a case-by-case basis as much as other\nissues.  Judges decide whether political speech is allowed on the\nsidewalk in front of the post office.  They do not try to decide just\nwhether pro-nazi, pro-choice, pro-life, or pro-tax political speech\nshould be allowed on the sidewalk in front of the post office.  You can\nimagine the result if right to free speech was decided by the majority\non a case-by-case basis.\n\nNot so with economic issues.  Government does tell taxi-drivers exactly\nwhat they can charge, but not the bus lines or the lawyers.\n\nJust as it is not desireable to decide rights of free speech on a\ncase-by-case basis, we should not decide rights to free enterprise on a\ncase-by-case basis.\n\nThere is hope that a government can be restricted from interferring with\nfree enterprise.  But there is no hope, in my opinion, of having a\ngovernment that interferes with free enterprise in an "efficient"\nmanner; I call it political market failure.\n\nThus, if you value freedom and the abundance it produces, you have to\nswallow the "whole libertarian agenda."
Ed of course has never demonstrated remarkable knowlege of socialism, \nor any other political system come to that.\n\n\nThat leaves Germany, Japan and the UK as examples of a country where the\nright wing government is on the verge of collapse. Oh and of course the USA\nwhich just elected a socialist government :-)\n\n\nEtc, unfortunately you can't pin this on the left or the right, both are\nto blame. Both sides are equally deep into the corruption scandal. The only \nuntained party is the northern league which is a bunch of nationalist\nseparatists and the communist party which has collapsed.\n\n\n\nEd should take a look at the budget deficit Regan and Bush created together\nbefore he starts to make claims about europe collapsing based on the budget\ndeficits here. None of them are serious on the USA scale.\n\nAnd here in Europe we have zero interest in Ed-Ipser type freed thank you.\nWe do not want our countries to be run by a narrow elite of rich lawyers\nfor the benefit of the super wealthy. We are quite happy with social \ndemocracy and despite the fuss made in Time and Newsweek there is remarkably\nlittle being done to reverse the social welfare reforms brought in by\nsocialism.\n\nThe problem with socialism is that it started with the aims of free education\nand health care and provision of the welfare state. This has been achieved\nacross the whole of Europe, only the USA is struggling to catch up. The\nproblem for socialism is what to do now it has succeeded.\n\n\n\nEd starts to discus LA, presumably he thinks that it is in Europe. On\nthe other hand he most probably hasn't heard of a European city.\n\n\nRather the opposite. What is happening in Italy is that the communist party\nhas collapsed. This has meant that the grand coalition between right and\nleft wing parties to keep out the communists has also collapsed. The \nmagistrates have seized this opportunity to crack down hard on fraud and \ncorruption and have arrested half the politicians. The fact that the socialists\nare in charge this week is incidental, the right is into the corruption just\nas baddly.\n\nWhat looks likely to happen is the fringe parties are going to do much\nbetter in the next election.

# ## # Gay men constitute at least 20% of all child molestations.  Whether\n# ## # this is because gay molesters are unusually common, or have unusually\n# ## # high numbers of victims, sort of misses the point, doesn't it?  It\n# ## # means that whichever is the case, homosexual men are remarkably\n# ## # hazardous to children.\n# #\n# #\n# #You are incorrect.  The most recent survey data I can find shows that\n# #26% of molestation is exclusively homosexuals, 4% is bisexual (victims\n# #are both male and female), and the remainder is exclusively heterosexual.\n\n#     So what you are saying is that 74% of the child molestations are \n#   committed by heterosexuals. I cannot see the correlation you cite\n\nBisexuals are heterosexuals?  Since when?\n\n#   which concludes that by being homosexual, you will molest children or that\n#   by being homosexual you will have the propensity for molesting children.\n\nI haven't said that "homosexual = child molester," simply that is more\nlikely.\n\n#   If 26% of the molestations are by homosexuals, why are you so concerned\n#   about creating a relation between the two? If you had evidence that \n#   95% of the molestations are committed by homosexuals you might find a \n#   relationship.

Two institutions with absolute power.  Cute.\n\n      Let's talk practicality, shall we?  If the Monarch tried to\ndo something, what would happen?\n  \n\n       But you illustrated the problem very well.\n\n\n       I am contending that there is no state in the Union which does\nnot have ample wealth, if they choose to spend it, to run a perfectly\nacceptable Education system.  (I further contend that the amount of money\nbeing spent now is more then sufficient, but is being spent badly.)\n\n\n       So, tell me Phill.  Were the Republicans also responsible for some\nof the *huge* increases in social programs?  Or were they *only* \nresponsible for what you don't like.  (I contend it is Congress which\nis to blame.  Democrat and Republican alike.)\n\n\n       Most of our worst areas are still better off than most of Europe.\nIn any case, we're talking about *education*.  \n\n\n       Yes, I live in once such area.  You're woefully ignorant of the\nsituation.\n\n       At the same time some of Tennessee's school districts are closing\ndown, the Governor asked for 7.5 million dollars for bicentenntial\ncelebration license plats.  In almost the same breath he wanted to raise\nunemployment compensation and reduce taxes which paid into it.\n \n       I don't know about the rest of the country, but *our* education\nproblems stem directly from two problems, neither of which are a lack\nof money in the state.  (BTW, Tennessee is considered a "tax heaven"\nand our economy is one of the strongest in the country.  *I* see\na correlation.)  1)  What money we spend goes primarly to administration.\nThe average administrator makes two and a half times what the average\nteacher makes, and sucks up an enormous amount of revenue.  And 2)\nthe Governor is making a concerted effort to create an "Education crisis"\nin order to push for his pet income tax.  Some of the most idiotic\nprograms get funded (like State funds for new art in the county seat)\nwhile schools are closing.  It's not a lack of funds.  It's an\nunwillingness to spend them on what is more appropriate.  Education\nis *the* parental hot-button.  Education is *always* the first to\nbut cut, because it's easier to get people to pay for their children\nthan ugly art.\n\n\n      It spoke very eloquently on government being based on the\nconsent of the governed.  \n\n\n      They did it anyway.  The Continental Congress had its own set of\nbylaws.  It wasn't quite a government, but a means of making decisions\nhad to be created.  (However low George Washington's opinion of them were.)\n\n\n      Allow me again to speak heresy against the Holy Democratic Orders.\nSo what?  The government was built with a very non-democratic Presidency\nwith fairly broad powers, including the veto.\n\n\n      Yes, and the Senate was intended to act as a balance to this.\nToo much democracy was intentionally avoided.  It was considered a good\nthing to place non-democratic blocks to impulsive action.\n\n\n      So long as Congress has something to sell, people will pay for\nit.  Most congressmen rake in more money than they need.\n\n\n       No, if the "progressives" don't want the "reactionaries" to move\nbackward, they get the same benefit.  41% of the states is a *lot* of\npeople.  And historically laws with that sort of minority arent'\nvery effective, especially since it is usually geographically\nconcentrated.\n       When wielding the Federal Big Stick I don't see why they shouldn't\nhave to make a better argument than, "more people than not," agree.\n       \n\n       I'm not a Republican.  I'm a republican.  :-)\n       \n       And no, I'm neither a Democrat nor a democrat.\n       \n       Now, I've asked several times, and all you've done is answer\n"It isn't democratic," which I knew before I said it.  Why *should*\nit be democratic?  We don't have a true direct democracy, and few\npeople advocate one.  Why, then, is this other modification of\ndemocracy to bias it against action so much worse?

Which, considering the amount Bush&congress added to it, would be a\nnot-inconsiderable achievement.\n\nWhile we're on the subject, I also believe that the supply-side claim that\nreducing taxes raised revenue is also false, because they typically factor in\nSocSec taxes, which were *raised* a considerable amount, at the same time that\nincome taxes were cut.  If you look at income tax revenue alone, it fell after\nafter the cuts began, and didn't recover for several years. By then, record\ndeficits were well entrenched.\n\n*crunch, crunch*
Government-Mandated Energy Conservation is Unnecessary and Wastful, Study Finds\n\n  Washington, DC -- The energy tax and subsidized energy-efficiency\n  measures supported by President Clinton and Energy Secretary Hazel\n  O'Leary are based on faulty assumptions, a new study from the Cato\n  Institute points out.\n\n    According to Jerry Taylor, Cato's director of natural resource studies,\n  we are not running out of sources of energy. The world now has almost 10\n  times the proven oil reserves it had in 1950 and twice the reserves of\n  1970. Proven reserves of coal and natural gas have increased just as\n  dramatically.\n\n    When standards of living, population densities, and industrial\n  structures are controlled for, the United States is no less energy\n  efficient than Japan and more energy efficient than many of the Group\n  of Seven nations.\n\n    Energy independence provides little protection against domestic oil\n  price shocks because the energy economy is global. Moreover, since the\n  cost of oil represents only about 2 percent of gross national product,\n  even large increases in the price of oil would have little impact on the\n  overall U.S. economy.\n\n    Market economies are, on average, 2.75 times more energy efficient per\n  $1,000 of GNP than are centrally planned economies.\n\n    Utilities' subsidized energy-efficiency measurs, known as demand-side\n  management programs, encourage free riders, overuse of competing resource\n  inputs, an competitive inequities. Furthermore, DSM programs do not\n  reduce demand.\n\n    Taylor concludes that government-mandated energy conservation imposes\n  unnecessary costs on consumers and wastes, not conserves, energy; that\n  subsidizing energy-conservation technologies will stymie, not advance,\n  gains in energy conservation; and that central control over the lifeblood\n  of modern society--energy--would transfer tremendous power to the state\n  at the expense of the individual.\n\n    "Energy Conservation and Efficiency: The Case Against Coercion" is no.\n  189 in the Policy Analysis series published by the Cato Institute, an\n  independent public policy research organization in Washington, DC.\n\n\n\nAvailable from:\n  Cato Institute\n  224 Second Street SE\n  Washington, DC  20003\n\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n                        The Cato Institute\n\n    Founded in 1977, the Cato Institute is a public policy research\n  foundation dedicated to broadening the parameters of policy debate\n  to allow consideration of more options that are consistent with the\n  traditional American principles of limited government, individual\n  liberty, and peace.  To that end, the Institute strives to achieve\n  greater involvement of the intelligent, concerned lay public in \n  questions of policy and the proper role of government.\n    The Institute is named for Cato's Letters, libertarian pamphlets\n  that were widely read in the American Colonies in the early 18th\n  century and played a major role in laying the philosophical foundation\n  of the American Revolution.\n    Despite the achievement of the nation's Founders, today virtually\n  no aspect of life is free from government encroachment.  A pervasive\n  intolerance for individual rights is shown by government's arbitrary\n  intrusions into private economic transactions and its disregard for\n  civil liberties.\n    To counter that trend the Cato Institute undertakes an extensive\n  publications program that addresses the complete spectrum of policy\n  issues.  Books, monographs, and shorter studies are commissioned\n  to examine the federal budget, Social Security, regulation, military\n  spending, international trade, and myriad other issues.  Major policy\n  conferences are held throughout the year, from which papers are\n  published thrice yearly in the Cato Journal.\n    In order to maintain its independence, the Cato Institute accepts\n  no government funding.  Contributions are received from foundations,\n  corporations, and individuals, and other revenue is generated from\n  the sale of publications.  The Institute is a nonprofit, tax-exempt,\n  educational foundation under Section 501(c)3 of the Internal Revenue\n  Code.
This is why I asked to be 'enlightened'.  You are making claims about what\n'is' or 'is not' part of this program.  But if the "block grants" go to states\nand cities, the mayors list is VERY relivent.\n  \n\nOkay scarasm does deserve sacrasm, but I already contact my local officals, my\ncongress rep., senators, Watch evening news, news programs, and C-SPAN.\n  \n\n\nThe fact is that Primetime (TM of ABC) has had numberous reposts on such waste\nprograms that already exist.  Again, if we are truely intrested in eliminating\nthe DEBT, we must REMOVE the DEFICIT, and do away with ALL PORK !!!  \n\nThere have been several books written on gov. waste, network news programs \nfrom time to time devote segments to this, and there have been bills proposed\nthat significantly reduces expenditures without touching external programs by \nchanging the way 'congress does business' (and make it more efficent).\n\nTrue, blame is easy, but also is spending someone else's money.  \n\nClinton ran on a platform that he would '...not raise taxes on the middle class\nto pay for these (his) programs'.  He has proposed a program that is not \nspecific, that counts on tax hikes to pay for.\n\n-- \n======================================================================\n\nKen M.

Joe,\n\n     As usual, this issue of dysfunction, of bad values, of messed up culture \nis easily embraced by non african americans when it comes to explaining\nproblems in our community. From your post, you apparently find the idea that\nsomething is wrong with African Americans, value-wise, culture wise or\nsomething, very appealing. I never cease to be amazed at how eager non african\namericans are to embrace theories about our problems which basically assert\nthat something is wrong with us. The socio-economic factors which we know help \nto produce high crime levels, like poverty, which exists among us in large \nproportion, I mean when it comes to discussion of african american problems, we\nsomehow become exempt from all these types of factors, and the problem is \nlaid at the doorstep of some neboulous dysfunction we supposedly have. But \nnobody attributes crime amongst white americans to dysfunction. No, that has \nsocioeconomic factors to it, but for africa americans, its gotta be a \ndysfunction.\n\nBasically, I think this tendency for non african americans to believe that\nsomething is wrong with us exists because non african americans don't want to\ndeal with the possiblility that the society is deeply biased against african\namericans, and that this is about 80% of the problem. It could not possible be\nthat the society is so deeply racist and structured against us, that this has\na very effective negative effect on us. No, something is wrong with us.\nNon african americans are quick to disregard what we have to say, because they \nare so busy trying to find something wrong with us, instead of taking a good \nhard look at the thing we say are doing us damage. I would get angry if it \nwerent' so damn typical.
# 	Actually, I was rather surprised to see an article on this subject\n# (i.e. the "new, inproved" survey saying that roughly 1% of men are gay)\n# on the front page of The New York _Times_ recently (I think it was\n# on Thurs, 15 April).  The headline was something to the effect of \n# "New Survey Finds 1% of Men Are Gay"\n# \n# 	I was shocked, not because the New York _Times_ was running a story\n# on a sex survey (although that was part of it), but because they thought\n# that this news was actually important enough to warrant front page space.\n# I mean, how many people actually CARE how many people are gay (as long as\n# you know how to find/avoid them if you want to)?  I don't.  \n\nIf you don't care, why was so much effort put into promoting the\n10% lie?  Because it was important to scare politicians into\nobedience.\n\n# 							-Matt

You misunderstand.  I'm not trying to prove a *cause* for anything. \nMerely pointing out that Ted's assertion that the "blip" in revenues was\n"caused" by selling to avoid the tax can't be proven.\n\n\n	Not disputed.\n\n\n	It works for any situation.  If you believe the market is going up,\ndon't sell.\n\n	If believe it's not, sell.  But then you'd be selling anyways, wouldn't\nyou?\n\n	So where is the evidence that a large number of people suddenly decided\nthat the higher taxes meant they should sell before the year was out?\n\n	There isn't any.\n\n	Ted's saying that the increase over the previous year is "proof" of\nthat proposition, but I'm saying you can't know that the trend of increasing\ncapital gains revenues wouldn't account for a lot of that increase.\n	1986 was the height of the housing boom, remember.  People were\n"trading up" like mad.\n\n\n	Indeed.

What kind of brainless clod doesn't understand the difference \n     between a "PROPOSED BILL, BLOCKED IN CONGRESS" and an "EXECUTIVE\n     ORDER, ISSUED BY CLINTON, AND CRAMMED DOWN OUR THROATS".\n\n     \n  Here, let me give a remedial course in thinking:\n\n     In order to create the appearance of low interest rates, Uncle Sam\n     has shifted his debt from long-term to short-term securities.\n\n     In effect, Uncle Sam has transformed the Federal Goverment into\n     one giant S&L, waiting to blow.\n\n     Short-term rates rise --->  Interest payments on Deficit rise --->\n     Uncle Sammy has to borrow more ---->  Causing Short-term rates to rise.\n\n     Uncle Sammy gets caught in a positive feedback loop.  His options:\n\n       i) Raise taxes a truly unimaginable amount\n       ii)  Make truly unimaginable spending cuts\n\n    Results of i):  large numbers of pissed-off citizens\n    Results of ii): large numbers of pissed-off citizens
Very simple.  An 'Insurance Commissioner' is a bureaucrat - a regulator.\nIt is his/her duties to make rules to enforce laws.  He/she cannot\nmake laws.  If there is no law that covers a specific subject, say\nscam insurance companies, a regulator cannot create one.  So they have\nto go to a proper legislative body to get such a law enacted.  For\nthe California Insurance Commissioner, there are two possible legislative\nbodies:  the California State Legislature and the U.S. Congress.  We all\nknow how little the California State Legislature accomplishes, esp. \nalong the lines of insurance reform legislation (negative movement).  So\nGaramendi wants the feds to do it, because: (a) he has a better chance\nof getting a federal law through, and (b) since many of the scam\ncompanies work across state lines/national borders, it is better to\nhave a law that reach out into other jurisdictions.

There are situations\nin which boys and girls are apart from members of the *opposite* sex\n(due to social convention or whatever) and thus are safe (in at least\nsome sense). These same situations don't (necessarily) protect the\nchildren from abuse by members of the *same* sex.\n\nIf we can understand that, it's not such a tremendous leap to suggest\nthat if we all think about it hard, *someone* may come up with a\npractical solution (or even a partial solution) to some of the situations\nin which children are made vulnerable to homosexuals who wish to abuse\nthem.

Oh, *really*???\n\n\nI know that when working in Alberta, Ontario and Quebec, I was aware\nthat I was paying for health insurance - e.g., in Toronto, OHIP fees\nwere listed seperately on my pay stub.\n\nWhile I'm not the only Canadian who favours lower taxes and cutbacks\nin spending, health insurance isn't on the table.  See our polls ...\nA better one might be the July 1st polls conducted for Macleans (our\nmajor English newsmagazine) by Decima Research ... Decima president\nAllen Gregg is considered one of the world's top poll researchers,\nand Mulroney's Conservatives have relied on him to keep in power in\nthe face of impossible election situations.  I haven't had a chance\nto see this year's version due to our library, but previous ones\nbefore the Americans started their assault and disinformation had\nshown satisfaction at 97% and switching to an American all-private\nsystem had support within statistical noise.  The Decima polls are\nconsidered definitive.  Even the new Reform Party, a breakoff of\ntraditionalists from the Conservatives with a mildly "libertarian"\nfaction, hold our public health insurance as an untouchable but that\njust a few people have to be reminded that it's not free (the average\nCanadian/European is more fiscally naive than their American\ncounterparts on issues like these).\n\nPersonally, I feel that the universal health insurance approach used\nin Canada, France and Germany -- paying to private health providers in\na nominally free market not unlike America's, minus HMO's -- depends a\nlot on values in those societies different from the U.S.  The basic\nhealth needs for life are not viewed as market, but the insurance does\nallow the market to address that -- basic health care is not viewed on\nthe level of ownership of a VCR as Americans would see it.

Black's Law\nDictionary (every law student/lawyer's friend) defines rape as: Unlawful\nsexual intercourse with a female without her consent. The unlawful\nknowledge of a woman by a man forcibly and against her will. The Model\nPenal Code (the statute proposed by the National Conference of Commissioners\nof Uniform State Laws or other organization for adoption by state legislatures)\ndefines rape as: A male who has sexual intercourse with a female not his wife\nis guilty of rape if he (a) compels her to submit by force or by threat of\nimminent death.... (MPC @213.1(1)(a))\n\nIndeed the following jurisdictions/states have statutes similar to the MPC:\n\nAlabama-- Code of Ala. @13A-6-61 (1992)\nArkansas--Ark.Stat.Ann. @5-14-103 (1993)\nDistrict of Columbia--D.C. Code @22-2801 (1992)\nGeorgia--O.F.G.A. @16-6-1 (1992)\nIdaho--Idaho Code @18-6101 (1992)\nMaryland--Md.Ann.Code.Art. 27 @462 (1992)\nMississippi--Miss.Code Ann. @97-3-71 (1993)\nNew York (check case law)--N.Y.C.L.S. Penal @130.35 (1993)\nNorth Carolina--N.C. Gen.Stat. @14-27-2 (1992)\nPuerto Rico--L.P.R.A. @4062 (1993)\n\nTa,
The immunization program is just a "useful first step". Among other\n    things, the money will go to pay for creating and maintaning a\n    a computerized "innoculation" database on all U.S. children.\n    (code-named Big Mother... Just kidding, the name will be Children\n    Defense Database, or something like that.)\n\n    Once the money is spent and little or no tangible results achieved, \n    the goverment will have to start knocking down doors, in some \n    neigborhoods, and bribe parents in others (probably the ones that \n    are paying kids for attending the school - what a fantastic idea!)\n\n\n\n-- \n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed are mine, not my employer's.

THE WHITE HOUSE\n\n                    Office of the Press Secretary\n_____________________________________________________________________\nFor Immediate Release                                  April 15, 1993\n\n\n                            PRESS BRIEFING\n                           BY DEE DEE MYERS\n\n	     \n                          The Briefing Room\n\n\n9:45 A.M. EDT\n\n	     	  \n	     Q	  Why was the 10:00 a.m. postponed? \n	     	  \n	     MS. MYERS:  Just due to scheduling conflicts.  So as we \nput out, the President will meet with the leaders of the national \npolice organizations at 2:00 p.m. in the Rose Garden, as opposed to \n10:00 a.m.  The only other things on his schedule today are:  At \n11:00 a.m. he'll meet with General Vessey, who, as you know, is on \nhis way to Vietnam to continue working on the MIA-POW issue.  At \n12:30 p.m. he'll have lunch with the Vice President in the Oval \nOffice.  And at 2:00 p.m. he'll meet with the police organizations.\nThen from 3:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. he'll do his weekly photos with the \nvarious groups.\n	     \n	     Q	  A photo op with Vessey?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  There's no coverage on the Vessey meeting.\n	     \n	     Q	  Why?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  Why?  It's a closed meeting.  \n	     \n	     Q	  What about the lunch?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  The lunch?  No, there's no coverage.\n	     \n	     Q	  Is he meeting with any congress people today?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  Nothing scheduled.\n	     \n	     Q	  There are no meetings --\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  There are no congressional meetings today, \nno.\n	     \n	     Q	  Has the President been given any information by the \nPentagon or reached any conclusion about the validity of this report \nfrom Hanoi?  Any instructions to Vessey on how to deal with the \nVietnamese on that subject?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  Well, clearly, the report is the first order \nof business.  It's high on the agenda on something that they'll \ndiscuss.  I think the President and General Vessey will discuss the \nparameters of his visit to Vietnam today, but the President hasn't \ndrawn any conclusions about the report yet.  Certainly, it's \nsomething that he wants General Vessey to talk with the Vietnamese \nabout first.\n	     \n	     Q	  Did the President talk with any Republican senators \nyesterday about the stimulus package?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  He spoke with Senator Dole.\n	     \n	     Q	  How many times?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  I believe once during the day and once last \nnight.\n	     \n	     Q	  What was the outcome of that?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  They're continuing to work toward some kind \nof an agreement on a jobs package.\n	     \n	     Q	  Is it your impression that Senator Dole is in any \nway flexible on this?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  Well, I think we're hopeful that we're going \nto get some kind of jobs package through the Senate, and we'll \ncontinue to work with Senator Dole and others until we reach some \nkind of an agreement.\n	     \n	     Q	  Did they discuss the VAT tax?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  I don't know if that came up.\n	     \n	     Q	  Can you check that?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  Sure.\n\n	     Q	  So what are they -- is the President offering to \nscale down his program -- is that what he's trying to do, buy it down \nto where Dole will sign on?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  Well, he's trying to protect as much of it \nas he can.  But it's important to him to get some kind of a jobs \npackage through the Senate and through Congress now.  And as soon as \nwe reach some conclusions on that, we'll let you know.  But at the \nmoment, he's continuing to consult with members of Congress \nincluding, obviously, Senator Dole.\n	     \n	     Q	  Is he talking to anybody else?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  I don't believe he talked to any other \nRepublicans yesterday.\n	     \n	     Q	  Is he talking to anybody today?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  I don't think anything is scheduled, but I \nwouldn't rule it out.\n	     \n	     Q	  We were led to believe that the President called \nMr. Dole on the subject of Russian aid and that Bob Dole brought the \nconversation around to stimulus package.  Is that correct?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  I think the President has contacted several \npeople on Russian aid.  I think that it was always expected that the \nstimulus package or the jobs package will be part of any conversation \nhe would have with Senator Dole.  The primary objective of the \nconversation was Russian aid.  That was the first order of business, \nbut it was both.\n	     \n	     Q	  In the President's mind, are they linked \npolitically in that if the Republicans continue to reject the \nstimulus package, he thinks it will be harder to sell Russian aid to \nthe American people?  Has he made that argument?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  I can't talk about specifically what \narguments he might have made.  The President is obviously committed \nto both.  He liked to see a jobs package to the American people \nfirst.  But as you know, we outlined the details of additional \nRussian aid last night in Tokyo.\n	     \n	     Q	  But does the President believe that the stimulus \npackage will make it more difficult to persuade Americans to vote for \nRussian -- to accept a vote for Russian aid?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  I think that the President is going to \ncontinue to work to pass the stimulus package, to pass a jobs \npackage, and we're still hopeful that we'll get some kind of jobs \npackage through the Congress.\n	     \n	     Q	  Is it fair to say that the President is negotiating \nnow with Dole?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  He's discussing options with him.\n	     \n	     Q	  On the stimulus, is it your understanding that over \nthe break some Democrats, themselves, have left the support that they \nhad earlier for the package, the stimulus package?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  I think we still have wide support in the \nSenate for the jobs package.\n	     \n	     Q	  But specifically, that you've lost Democrats other \nthan Shelby?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  I don't believe so.  There hasn't been a \nvote.\n	     \n	     Q	  What about Kohl?\n	     \n	     Q	  Kohl and Feingold?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  There hasn't been a vote yet.  And we'll \ncontinue to work with senators to try to get a majority to try to \nbring the package to a vote, because we believe that a majority of \nthe members of the United States Senate support the package.\n	     \n	     Q	  If you're weren't worried about Kohl and Feingold, \nwhy did George mention Milwaukee projects the other day?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  I think George pointed out a number of \nprojects in a number of states that stand to be funded, or to lose \nfunding if this jobs package doesn't pass.\n	     \n	     Q	  No Democrats.  (Laughter.)\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  I'll let you draw your own conclusions.\n	     \n	     Q	  Does he plan to talk to Dole again today or any \nother Republicans again today?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  There's nothing specifically scheduled, but \nagain, I wouldn't rule it out.\n	     \n	     Q	  Does he plan to put out any more press releases to \nany other states today?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  What we've done is we're in the process of \nbreaking down the benefits of the jobs package state by state.  I \nthink it's entirely feasible that as we sort of are able to sum those \nup, we'll send out press releases to the various states that suggest \nhow their states would benefit from this package.\n	     \n	     Q	  Will you share those with us?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  Sure.  As we did yesterday.\n	     \n	     Q	  Do you have copies of the ones you sent --\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  Yes, we made those available yesterday.  And \nwe certainly can continue to provide them today.\n	     \n	     Q	  Dee Dee, since yesterday's questions and subsequent \nstories about the VAT, what further consideration of this issue has \nbeen given?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  Nothing's changed since yesterday.  I think \nthe President commented on it this morning to say only that it was \nsomething he knew was being considered by the task force and that he \nhas not made a decision on, and I don't think we have anything to add \nto that.\n	     \n	     Q	  But he also said that business and labor groups are \ntelling him they support it.  Can you tell us --\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  I think that there has been -- I'm not going \nto speculate on who supports it.  I think the President said that \nthere has been some support among business and labor groups.  I don't \nthink he said he was directly contacted by them.\n	     \n	     Q	  Are we to take that to mean that the administration \nhas sounded out business and labor groups on this --\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  I think there's been plenty of public \ndiscourse on this over the years and even recently, but I don't think \nI want to add to that.\n	     \n	     Q	  In February, though, the President said that this \nwas something to be considered 10 or 15 years down the road.  What \nhas happened between then and now to cause this administration to \nchange its mind?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  I think as we said yesterday, it is \nsomething that the working groups are looking at.  They're \nconsidering a wide variety of options on everything from funding to \nspecific options that will be covered by the President's health care \nplan.  The President has not taken it up yet, has not made a decision \non it.  And beyond that, I don't have anything to add.\n	     \n	     Q	  You haven't answered the question.  It wasn't being \nconsidered by anyone in the White House after the President's \ncomments in February, and George reaffirmed that in a briefing.\n	     \n	     Q	  And then suddenly --\n	     \n	     Q	  What happened?\n\n	     MS. MYERS:  The working groups, as we have said \nthroughout, we instructed to consider a wide variety of options \nacross-the-board.  And one of the things that has been talked about \nand that they are clearly considering is some kind of a value-added \ntax.\n\n	     Q	  But the President himself took this off the table, \nDee Dee, and suddenly it reappears.  And this goes to the credibility \nof this administration in a way.  What has happened in the meantime?\n\n	     MS. MYERS:  The President has not looked at this, it \nhasn't been presented to him, again, yet.  The working groups are \nlooking at it, as they're looking at a wide variety of options, and \nno decisions have been made.\n\n	     Q	  And it raises the question of how independently the \ntask force is working.\n\n	     MS. MYERS:  The task force was instructed to consider \nall options, and they've taken that mandate seriously and they're \nconsidering all options.\n\n	     Q	  But that's not the impression that the President \nleft in February.  The impression he left was that this was something \nthat was long-range, to be looked at 10, 15 years down the road.  The \nclear implication of his remarks was that this was something that was \nnot on the table, not an option. \n\n	     Q	  "If it changes I'll tell you."\n	     \n	     Q	  Bring him on.\n\n	     Q	  And you repeatedly referred to the President's \nremarks, telling us that those were still in operation.\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  It's changed, and we told you.  (Laughter.)\n	     \n	     Q	  But that's what Alice Rivlin's comments and Donna \nShalala comments were about.  I mean, that seemed like an \norchestrated effort because you have two independent Cabinet officers \n--\n\n	     MS. MYERS:  I wouldn't -- no, Alice Rivlin's not a \nCabinet member, first of all.  Second of all, it was not \norchestrated, but clearly, they both said yesterday and in the last \ncouple of days that it's something that's being looked at.  We \nconfirmed that yesterday.  And I don't have anything to add to that.\n\n	     Q	  Is it because he has very few options?\n\n	     Q	  Is this something that it will be incumbent upon \nthe task force to convince the President about?  In other words, has \nthe President himself personally ruled it out and it's now up to the \ntask force to convince him to put it back on the table?  Or is it, in \nfact, back on the table, having been placed there by discussions with \nthe President?  \n\n	     MS. MYERS:  It is not the working group's mission at \nthis point to convince the President of anything.  It is their \nmission to put before him his options and to explain the benefits and \nthe costs and the basic pros and cons of each of those options.  I \nthink that they will certainly present the VAT to him in that \ncontext, and at this point he's not -- that presentation has not been \nmade, but it's something that he will hear and he has not made a \ndecision on.\n\n	     Q	  They will present it to him as one of his options, \nthough he specifically ruled it out?\n\n	     MS. MYERS:  Correct.\n\n	     Q	  Dee Dee, is this more than a trial balloon?  Is \nthis a serious consideration that the working groups are giving to \nthis form of taxation?\n\n	     MS. MYERS:  It's simply a statement of fact.  The \nworking groups are considering a wide variety of options on a number \nof issues relating to health care reform.  One of the options that \nthey're looking at is the VAT. \n\n	     Q	  Dee Dee, when the working groups were examining \nthis possibility, was this on the table during the same time period \nthat you were telling us that it was not?\n\n	     MS. MYERS:  I don't know what the specific timing of \ntheir drafting of options is.  I don't know.\n\n	     Q	  Who was telling you that it was not under \nconsideration?\n\n	     MS. MYERS:  I was referring back to the President's \ncomments.\n\n	     Q	  Have they discovered that the sin taxes won't raise \nenough money to fund the core benefit package?\n\n	     MS. MYERS:  No, there's no decisions that have been made \non how to pay for the health care plan.\n	     \n	     Q	  I'm asking whether the projections --\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  There's a number of options depending on how \nthe plan is structured.  You can't decide how much the plan is going \nto cost until you decide what the plan is going to look like.  And so \nyou can't discuss what financing options have been ruled in our out \nuntil you know.\n\n	     Q	  Dee Dee, we've been told that they have a computer \nmodels on a number of possible packages.\n\n	     MS. MYERS:  Correct.  \n\n	     Q	  The question is whether they have now determined \nwhether sin taxes would not produce enough money for even the barest \nminimum package.  That is not a very difficult computation.\n\n	     MS. MYERS:  It is a question that you know that we're \nnot going to answer until -- there's a number of options being \nconsidered.  It depends on how the package is structured.  The exact \ndetails of the package and the financing mechanisms used to pay for \nthem are all among the decisions that have yet to be made.  \n	     \n	     Q	  And when the President has been meeting with health \ncare -- his health care advisors, which we are told he has been doing \n--\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  Correct.\n	     \n	     Q	     they have never once said to him, these are your \nfunding options, including the VAT?  He has never heard the word VAT \nin his --\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:    I am not going to comment on the specific \nnature of the daily -- they're not daily, but the quasi-regular \nbriefings.\n	     \n	     Q	  Well, you have.\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  I have not, other than to say that he's not \nconsidered the VAT.  And I think that is a true statement.\n	     \n	     Q	  No, but you said that it has not been presented to \nhim as an option.\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  Correct.\n	     \n	     Q	  That doesn't mean he hasn't heard about it.\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  I'm not going to get into the details of \nwhat's discussed.  I think that statement stands for itself.\n	     \n	     Q	     specific, Dee Dee.  When you say he hasn't \nlooked at it, do you mean that he hasn't looked at it in terms of \npaying for medical coverage, or hasn't looked at it in general?  \nBecause back in Chilicothe he was very specific in defining how it \nworks, what the advantages are, the whole thing.  It sounds like --\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  But that was -- I think in Chilicothe, if \nyou go back to his remarks there, it was a broader philosophical \ndiscussion of the tax structure.  And I think the comments were \ngenerally in reference to the overall economic plan.  But clearly, \nit's something that he's thought about in the broad context.  I mean, \nthat was clear in Chilicothe.  What I'm saying is that in the process \nof the working groups it's something that he hasn't considered yet.  \nIt's something that the working groups will present to him among the \nnumber of options, and that no decisions have been made.  And I'm not \ngoing to comment any further on the details of the meetings where \nhealth care issues are being discussed.\n	     \n	     Q	  It's your statement from this podium that no \ndiscussion of this has taken place.  You say that no option -- that \nthe option has not been presented to him.\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  That is correct.\n	     \n	     Q	  Do you stand by -- does the White House still stand \nby George's statement in March that this will not be in the proposal?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  No decisions have been made.  We have \nnothing to add to what's already been said.\n	     \n	     Q	  Let me follow up here.  Do you stand by what Rivlin \nsaid yesterday, that if any kind of VAT were to be used or \nconsidered, that other changes to the tax code would have to be made \nso that it would be less regressive?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  I'm not going to comment any further on what \nmight happen if.\n	     \n	     Q	  But do you stand by the previous conversations in \nFebruary that if there were to be a VAT, I think the President said \nyou'd exclude food and energy --\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  I'm not going to comment on the specific \nstructure of a decision that hasn't been made.\n	     \n	     Q	  Was the President aware prior to Donna Shalala's \ncomments yesterday that this was under consideration by the working \ngroups?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  I don't know specifically what --\n	     \n	     Q	  Could you check for us, because that's a real \nimportant credibility question?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  Sure.\n	     \n	     Q	  Since the task force was brought together this \nissue has been discussed, at the beginning and throughout, as one \nfairly painless way to raise a lot of money.  Were you all kept in \nthe dark?  Was the Press Office kept in the dark over the past month \nand a half when you've been denying that a VAT tax would be \nconsidered that it was actually on the table over there as an option?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  I think we've said all that we have to say.  \nIt is something the working groups are looking at.  The President has \nnot made a decision about it yet.  And beyond that, I have nothing to \nadd.\n	     \n	     Q	  Well, sorry, Dee Dee, there are still a couple of \nquestions that we are going to have to ask because we have a problem \nwith credibility here -- yours primarily.  What we're asking is, if \nyou all were not told at all that this thing was being considered \nwhile you were coming out here and telling us that it was not, or if \nit's a case that you were coming out here and deliberately misleading \nus.\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  I don't believe that anyone has ever come \nout here and deliberately misled you from this podium -- ever --ever.\n	     \n	     Q	  Has anyone tried to shade it a little bit to \nindicate something -- has anybody told anybody to come out --\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  We're not trying to shade answers or \ndeliberately mislead anybody.  I've said what I have to say about \nthis issue.\n	     \n	     Q	  All we were trying to find out --\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  I understand what you're trying to find out \nand I've given you the answers, Helen.\n	     \n	     Q	  We're trying to find out what changed -- what made \nit an option again.  That's the --\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  The working groups were given a broad \nmandate to investigate all options, and they are doing that.  \n	     \n	     Q	  Yes, but it wasn't an option before.  How can you \ninvestigate it if the President has taken it off the table?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  It is something that they're obviously \nconsidering and the President has not made a decision on.\n	     \n	     Q	  Yes, but he took it off the table in February.\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  Working groups are considering it.  They'll \npresent it to the President at some point and he'll make a decision.\n	     \n	     Q	  Why would they consider it if he has taken it off \nthe table?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  It's clearly on the table. \n	     \n	     Q	  Yes, but he took it off the table.  Did he change \nhis mind?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  It's back on the table, Bill.\n	     \n	     Q	  Did he change his mind?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  He said this morning that he hasn't made a \ndecision about it.  He obviously knows that it's on the table.  It's \nsomething that he will look at at some and when we have a decision on \nthis we'll let you know.\n	     \n	     Q	  So he must have changed his mind, right?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  At some point it will be looked at.  I mean, \n--\n	     \n	     Q	  Dee Dee, there's like two options -- either he \nchanged his mind or the working groups think they're authority \nexceeds the President's.\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  The working groups were given a broad \nmandate to look at all options; they've done that.\n	     \n	     Q	  Are you going to put out his income tax?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  Yes, there will be something available on \nhis income tax probably later this afternoon.  His return will be \navailable. \n	     \n	     Q	  Will there be any kind of briefing to go through \nit?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  No, nothing's planned.  I think someone will \nbe available, probably not in a briefing setting, but to walk you \nthrough the questions.\n	     \n	     Q	  We're used to be walked line-by-line through the \npresidential tax forms.\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  I've seen those briefings.  (Laughter.)\n	     \n	     Q	  Could we have one?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:   No, I don't think there will be any kind of \na formal briefing, but there will be somebody available to answer \nyour questions about it.\n	     \n	     Q	  Did they file a joint form?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  Yes.\n	     \n	     Q	  When did he file it?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  I believe it's being filed today.\n	     \n	     Q	  Dee Dee, is there going to be a backgrounder for \nMiyazawa?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  No, there will be a readout after the \nmeeting.\n	     \n	     Q	  No backgrounder today?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  No backgrounder today.\n	     \n	     Q	  This is complicated stuff.  We need help.  \n(Laughter.)\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  We can't give you taxes and Miyazawa all in \none day, it's too confusing.  (Laughter.)\n	     \n	     Q	  Vance and Owen have opened the doors on the use of \nforce in Bosnia.   They've both said that, A, they never ruled it \nout, and B, it might be necessary now.  Does that influence your \nthinking on whether or not to change your approach?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  There's been no change in our policy towards \nBosnia.  We have always said that we'd consider --\n	     \n	     Q	  But does that impact upon your decision?  Are they \npeople whose opinions would carry weight with you?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  They're people whose opinions carry weight \ncertainly.  I mean, the President supports the process that they've \ninitiated.  But there's been no change in our policy for Bosnia, \nalthough we're considering a number of options right now.  If the \nSerbs don't come back to the negotiating table, if they don't sign on \nto some kind of an agreement, we will consider additional options, \nwhich we've been saying regularly.\n	     \n	     Q	  One follow-up question then?  We cannot get a \nstraight answer from anyone in the administration.  Why do you not \nset a deadline for the Serbs?  Can you tell us the strategic or \ntactical reasons for not giving them a deadline to come to the table?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  We're continuing to put pressure on them \nevery day.\n	     \n	     Q	  Which doesn't work so --\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  Well, we think it is having some effect.  \nWe're going to continue to tighten sanctions.  As you know, we \nsupport the omnibus resolution.  We expect that to come to a vote on \nthe 26th.  \n	     \n	     Q	  You say it's having an effect -- can you give us \nany documentation?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  I'd be happy to provide somebody to talk to \nyou about the impact of the sanctions and things like that.\n	     \n	     Q	  There's been no -- you have not been able to \nprovide anybody who can tell us that the sanctions have had any \neffect in Bosnia.  Serbia, yes; in Bosnia, no.\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  I think that they've had effect in Serbia \nand we think they've had some effect in Bosnia.  And again, I'll be \nhappy to provide somebody to walk you through the details of that, if \nyou'd like.\n	     \n	     Q	  We would like to hear from someone who can show us \nwhat the effect has been in Bosnia.  We had the briefing on all of \nthe terrible things that are happening in Belgrade, but we haven't \nseen anything that indicates an impact on the fighting.  Can you \nprovide something along those lines?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  I will see what I can get you.\n	     \n	     Q	  On the extra Russian aid that Christopher announced \nthis morning -- where is that money coming from?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  We'll have to work with Congress on the \ndetails of that package.\n	     \n	     Q	  So that would be new money that you would hope to \nget?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:    Yes, that's new money, in addition to the \n$1.6 billion announced in Vancouver.  So I assume that you all have \nseen the $1.8-billion package that was announced this morning in \nTokyo by Secretary Christopher.\n	     \n	     Q	  Isn't there a concern, though, about offering \nsomething which you have to get in Congress?  I mean, that was the \nconcern with Vancouver; you didn't want to do that.\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  The concern with Vancouver was to do \nsomething immediately, which required money that was already approved \nin the Fiscal '93 budget.  What we're looking at now is a little bit \nlonger-term plan to build on top of the $1.6 billion that we \nannounced in Vancouver.  This clearly will require congressional \napproval, or some of it will anyway, and we're going to continue to \nwork with Congress to make that happen.\n	     \n	     Q	  To what extent has that been vetted or agreed to by \nCongress?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  The President has had a number of \nconversations with members and will continue to work with them as \nthis process moves forward.\n	     \n	     Q	  Was Christopher able to put this package out with a \nfair degree of understanding that you will be able to get it through \nCongress?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  It was created in consultation with \nCongress.\n	     \n	     Q	  In meeting with the law enforcement officials, is \nthat -- does that have a set speech and a goal?  A direction?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  Yes, the President will talk about -- and \nthe law enforcement organizations are endorsing the President's jobs \npackage.  They believe particularly the summer jobs package will help \ngive kids something to do.\n	     \n	     Q	  Who are they?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  It's members or leadership from three \norganizations:  NAPO, which is the National Association of Police \nOrganizations; IBPO, which is the International Brotherhood of Police \nOrganizations, I believe; and IUPA, which is the International Union \nof Police Associations.\n	     \n	     Q	  Will the FBI chief be there?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  The FBI chief?  No.\n	     \n	     Q	  Or any other federal law enforcement officials?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  No, it will be the President and these \nnational law enforcement organization leaders.\n	     \n	     Q	  Does the $1.8 billion announced today include the \n$400 million that's in the FY '94 budget for disarmament?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  No.  The Nunn-Lugar money is separate.\n	     \n	     Q	  So this would be the $700 million that's in the \nbudget already, plus another $1.1 billion?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  I believe all of this is on top of the $700 \nmillion already in the budget.\n	     \n	     Q	  Is this going to be part of the supplemental or \nFiscal '94 --\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  We'll work with Congress on the exact \nfunding mechanism -- on exactly how this will be paid for.\n	     \n	     Q	  This $1.8 billion on top of --\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  On top of $700 million -- on top of the $400 \nmillion Nunn-Lugar money we announced earlier.\n	     \n	     Q	  And this is what prompted the President to call Bob \nDole -- it was on this tranche, not on the previous money he was \ncalling Bob Dole?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  Correct.\n	     \n	     Q	  Is there a briefing on Miyazawa?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  There will be a readout after the meeting \nwith Miyazawa.  Tomorrow.\n	     \n	     Q	  Dee Dee, on a totally unrelated matter, some \nRepublicans who are active in the U.S. Chamber of Commerce are \ncomplaining about this new cozy relationship between the White House \nand the Chamber of Commerce.  There are -- the town hall meeting the \nother night, the satellite and all of this relationship.\nDoes the White House feel that you're getting too close to these \nChambers of Commerce?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  That's an interesting charge.  (Laughter.)  \nAfter how many years of Democrats being accused of not paying any \nattention to the Chambers, now there are those who would accuse us of \nbeing too close.  I think that's interesting.  But no, we're thrilled \nby the support we've received from the national Chamber and local \nChambers across the country and we'll continue to work with them on \nthis and other initiatives.\n	     \n	     Q	  What's the status of the President thinking about \ngoing to this Democratic retreat?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  It's on his calendar.  I think he'll almost \ncertainly go.\n	     \n	     Q	  All three days?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  We haven't figured out exactly when he'll be \nthere yet.  \n	     \n	     Q	  Is it open to coverage?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  No, I believe the whole thing is closed.\n	     \n	     Q	  Is he going to have any kind of address, statement, \nanything at all on the gay rights march on the 25th?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  We're still looking at that.  We haven't \nmade a final decision about how we'll -- who will make a statement or \nwhat --\n	     \n	     Q	  Any meetings scheduled with any of the leaders?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  Nothing is scheduled, but I wouldn't rule it \nout.\n	     \n	     Q	  What about an AIDS czar?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  It's coming.\n	     \n	     Q	  Anything on the weekend?\n	     \n	     Q	  There's been a suggestion that he's going to this \nretreat to avoid having to participate in the gay rights -- or appear \nor have any involvement in the gay rights march.\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  No, I think this is something he's been \ndiscussing for a long time -- appearing at the Senate Democratic \nretreat.\n	     \n	     Q	  The weekend?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  Weekend?  Don't know -- the only thing on \nright now is the radio address on Saturday.\n	     \n	     Q	  Any travel plans?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  If it changes -- none right now.\n	     \n	     Q	  He's not going to be off campaigning for his \nstimulus package?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  No specific plans right now.\n	     \n	     Q	  What about mid-week?  Anything likely?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  It's possible.  Yes, I think it's likely \nthat we'll travel next week -- certainly the weekend.\n	     \n	     Q	  Has he called Thurmond about his daughter?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  I don't know.  I'll check.\n	     \n	     Q	  Going to name a drug czar this weekend?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  This weekend?  I don't believe so.\n	     \n	     Q	  And the radio address on Saturday -- is that going \nto be focused on the stimulus package?\n	     \n	     MS. MYERS:  I'm sure it will.\n	     \n	     THE PRESS:  Thank you.
Pity you didn't say something about the use of statistics to justify\ntargeting and persecuting a minority, then.\n\n\n\nWhat in the Tree makes you think we queers CAN'T experience that commitment? \nWhat's stopping us from committing to one partner for the rest of our lives? \nI have every intention of doing so, once I find the right person...and\nwhether that person is male or female, I seriously doubt that a church\nceremony/public vow/licence will make any difference whatsoever in the sort\nof commitment I experience with that person.  You have no conception of the\ndifference marriage makes since you have never known any other way.\n\n\n\n\nYou're getting to the right idea here...just be careful of making statements\nlike the above, and you'll be part of the solution and not the problem.\n\n\nNo flames necessary. :)\n\nDrywid

Residence means\nliving in a particular locality, but domicile means living in that\nlocality with intent to make it a fixed and permanent home.

THE WHITE HOUSE\n\n                    Office of the Press Secretary\n______________________________________________________________\nFor Immediate Release                             April 13, 1993     \n\n	     \n                      REMARKS BY THE PRESIDENT,\n               SECRETARY OF EDUCATION RICHARD RILEY AND\n                   SECRETARY OF LABOR ROBERT REICH  IN \n                GOALS 2000 SATELLITE TOWN HALL MEETING\n	     \n                     Chamber of Commerce Building\n                           Washington, D.C.   \n\n\n\n8:30 P.M. EDT\n	     \n	     \n	     SECRETARY RILEY:  Good evening and welcome to all of you \nin the thousands of communities around the country that are taking \npart in this satellite town meeting for the month of April.\n	     \n	     You know, today is April 13th.  In 1743, Thomas \nJefferson was born, 250 years ago.  I think that's appropriate to \nmention at the beginning of this meeting because since that time he \nhas been, of course, a person who has been one that we've all \nfollowed in terms of our democracy and the importance of education \nhere in this great country.  The success of our democracy according \nto Jefferson really depends upon the success of our educational \nsystem.\n	     \n	     His philosophy of government, his belief in the \nimportance of education is also very meaningful to our special guest \nhere this evening.  Tonight we're so pleased to have with us \nPresident Clinton.  He's come over from the White House to join us in \nthe Chamber of Commerce studios.  \n	     \n	     Mr. President, it's good to have you.  We thank you for \ntaking the time to visit with these communities here on the satellite \nnetwork and we welcome you here this evening.\n	     \n	     Also we have with us Secretary of Labor Robert Reich.  \nAnd, Bob, it's certainly pleasant to have you with us this evening \nalso.\n	     \n	     I have some questions for our two guests, and I'm sure \nmany of you do, too.  So please call us if there's something that \nyou'd like to ask.  The number is 1/800/368-5781 or 5782.  In \nWashington, D.C. the number is 202/463-3170 or 3171.\n	     \n	     I believe the President has a few words that he might \nwant to share with us.  And, Mr. President, I'll ask you to do that \nat this time.  It's great to have you.\n	     \n	     THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much, Mr. Secretary.\n	     \n	     I'm glad to be here with my friends, Dick Riley and Bob \nReich -- also members of my Cabinet -- at the headquarters of the \nChamber of Commerce to support the effort that the Chamber is making, \nalong with its Center for Work Force Preparation, to help to examine \ntonight the whole critical question of how to move our young people \nfrom school to the work place.\n	     \n	     I want to compliment the Chamber on all their efforts, \nrecognizing that without an educated work force we can't grow this \neconomy or remain competitive, and recognizing that we all have to \nwork together -- business and government, labor and educators -- to \nmake things happen.\n	     \n	     This satellite town meeting is a good example of that \nkind of working together.  And if you'll forgive me a little home \nstate pride, I want to say a special word of thanks to the Wal-Mart \nCorporation, headquartered in Bentonville, Arkansas, for providing \nseveral hundred of the sites for this town meeting tonight.  I \nappreciate that a lot, as well as the sites that are provided for all \nthe rest of you.\n	     \n	     I have tried as hard as I could to move toward \nconstructive change for this country.  Secretary Riley talked about \nthis being Thomas Jefferson's 250th birthday.  If Thomas Jefferson \nbelieved in anything, he believed in these three things:  first, in \neducation; second, in real personal liberty, freedom of religion, \nfreedom of speech, freedom of association, freedom of the press; and \nthird, in the absolute imperative of changing as times change.  \n	     \n	     If you go to the Jefferson Memorial here in this \nbeautiful city, which is now bedecked with all of its wonderful \ncherry blossoms, you will see Jefferson saying that we have to change \nwith changing times.\n	     \n	     For us here in America, that means reducing our deficit \nand increasing our investment and putting our people first so that we \ncan compete in the world.  We're here to talk about that tonight --\nabout what we can do to educate and train our people better.  Unless \nwe do that, none of the efforts that all the rest of us make in \ngovernment, even to bring the budget into balance, even to increase \nour investment in other things which will grow jobs, will last in the \nlong run.\n	     \n	     We also have to have people who can carry their load.  \nAnd in a world where the average young person will change jobs seven \nor eight times in a lifetime, that begins with the education system \nand continues into the work force where education must go on for a \nlifetime.  It's not just important what you know, but what you can \nlearn.\n	     \n	     And if I might, I'd like to close just by emphasizing \nwe're doing our best to try to have the most innovative partnership \nbetween the Labor Department and the Education Department and the \nprivate sector to build a good school-to-work transition.  And we're \ntrying to get off to a good start this summer with a program that \nwould create more than 700,000 new summer jobs, including many \nthousands that have a strong education component so our young people \ncan be learning and working at the same time.\n	     \n	     Dick, I think I ought to stop there.  That's a good \nplace we can begin, I think, the discussion.\n	     \n	     SECRETARY RILEY:  Thank you so much, Mr. President.\n	     \n	     Each month we get together and talk about ways that all \ncitizens can work towards reaching the national education goals.  And \ntonight, we'll focus on goal five, and how communities such as yours \ncan prepare students for this world of work.\n	     \n	     This week, the Education Department and the Labor \nDepartment are hosting a conference here in Washington, D.C. called \nSummer Challenge, a program of work and learning, to America's youth.  \nThe aim is to use some special funds from President Clinton's \nproposed economic stimulus package to provide educationally-enriched \njobs and summer school programs for young people in disadvantaged \nareas of the country.  \n	     \n	     Mr. President, let's talk a minute -- you alluded to it \nsomewhat -- about the  Summer Youth Challenge.  Your program calls \nfor more educational enrichment in the summer jobs.  And why in your \nwords is that so important?\n	     \n	     THE PRESIDENT:  I think it's important for two reasons.  \nFirst of all, a lot of the young people we're trying to reach may \nhave had trouble adjusting to school and learning.  And while we want \nthem to have a good experience with a real job, we also want them to \ncontinue to learn during the summer because we know from a lot of \nresearch that a lot of kids that have trouble learning in school may \nforget as much as 30 percent of what they learned the previous year \nover the summertime.  And that is a very unproductive thing for \nschools to have to take up a lot of time teaching what they already \ntaught before.\n	     \n	     Secondly, we want to help these young people progress, \nnot only in terms of work, but in terms of learning.  We want to \nabolish the artificial dividing line between what is work and what is \nlearning because we think that the best and most productive workers \nwill have to be lifetime learners.  And we think that this experience \ncould maybe drive that point home and prepare these young people to \nsucceed in school, or at work, or in college as they go on.\n	     \n	     SECRETARY RILEY:  Well, I think the fact that these are \ndisadvantaged kids -- that gap, that lag you mentioned as they go \ninto the next year, is really even greater.  \n	     \n	     Secretary Reich, of course, you have training programs \nthroughout the year.  And I wonder is you have any comment about this \neducational component of training.\n	     \n	     SECRETARY REICH:  Well, what we've learned, Mr. \nSecretary, is that for many young people, whether it's for the summer \nor for the year, actually on-the-job work experience combined with \neducation is one of the best ways of learning.  Many young people, \nfor example, have a lot -- they have a difficult time learning \ngeometry.  But when they actually are there building something or \nworking on something, and they can see the exact and direct \napplication of geometry, they understand what it's used for.  And a \nlot of young people -- just that sense of connection between \neducation and the world of work is terribly, terribly important.  \nIt's important during the summer, but it's important for a lot of \nyoung people even beyond the summer.\n	     \n	     SECRETARY RILEY:  Thank you.  \n	     \n	     Mr. President, you've called for a youth apprenticeship \nprogram, school-to-work transition.  And I wonder if you would tell \nus a little bit about your concept of that and how you see it \ndeveloping.\n	     \n	     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, first of all, let's talk about why \nit's important.  Most new jobs that will be created in this decade \nwill not require a four-year college degree, but most of them will \nrequire some learning and skills that go well beyond what most people \nget in a high school diploma.  \n	     \n	     If you look at the last 10 years, the average salaries \nof young people that had at least two years of good post-high school \neducation was a good salary that went up over the decade.  The young \npeople who had less than that tended to have lower wages that did not \ngo up, and in many cases in real terms fell over the decade, because \nthey weren't productive, they weren't more valuable to their \nemployers.\n	     \n	     So we think America has a big economic interest in \ntrying to ensure that all the young people who get out of high school \nbut don't go on to college make a transition to work, which includes \ntwo years of further training either in a community college, a \nvocational setting, or perhaps on the job.  And what I have done in \nthis budget, as you know, is to give you and Secretary Reich some \nfunds and some incentives to try to work in partnership with states \nand with the private sector to build these programs state-by-state in \na way that would be customized essentially by the business community, \nbased on the needs of the economy in any given area.  It could \nrevolutionize long-term the quality of the American work force and \nthe earnings of American workers.\n	     \n	     SECRETARY REICH:  I should add, Mr. President -- I think \nyou know this from your experience in Arkansas -- and many of the \npeople watching this program -- that the business community and \neducators, labor groups are already in many of our communities, many \nof our states, building a school-to-work transition program.  In \nfact, there's an awful lot of ferment, a lot of excitement.  The \npeople watching this program probably are the ones who are most \ndirectly involved in that.  And more power to them.  Secretary Riley \nand I are going to do everything we can to build on the successes \nalready out there.\n	     \n	     SECRETARY RILEY:  Bob, we're going to be talking tonight \nabout youth apprenticeship and tech prep, the co-op learning  \ncareer academies.  And what features all those programs that deal \nwith this subject -- what are some of the features that every one of \nthese school-to-work programs might have that   are important?\n	     \n	     SECRETARY REICH:  Well, one thing that we've seen -- and \nyou and I have been working at this for a long time, and you much \nlonger than I -- we've seen that active involvement of the business \ncommunity is absolutely essential.  And I'm so delighted that we're \ndoing this in the headquarters of the Chamber of Commerce.  The \nChamber of Commerce of the United States is committed to doing these \nkinds of programs -- training, education, retraining -- and we've \naimed to work very closely with the Chamber.\n	     \n	     The business community is going to be actively engaged \nin developing almost an audit of the kind of jobs that are needed and \nhelping the educators, community colleges, technical institutions \ndevelop curricula that are relevant for the jobs of the future.\n	     \n	     Communities have got to come together.  I mean, this is \none of the most important things.  You've got to have all of these \nplayers in a community come together and work together and cooperate \ntogether.  You know, too often we have the educators over here and \nthe business leaders over here, labor groups over here and everybody \nis talking, but they're not really working together in a common \nstrategy.\n	     \n	     And the third and final ingredient I would say, Dick, \nwould be a commitment to excellence -- a commitment both to academic \nexcellence and also to skills development excellence.  This is not a \ntracking program we're talking about for kids who are not going to \nmake it.  This is a program that every young person ought to be \neligible for.  If they want to go on beyond that to four-year \ncollege, that's fine.  That ought to be permissible.  But we're \ntalking about the foundation of learning about jobs, the foundation \nskills for on-the-job learning.\n	     \n	     And again, those are the critical components.  It's \nalready being done.\n	     \n	     THE PRESIDENT:  I think -- if I might just interject one \npoint based on my personal experience at home -- the business \ncommunity has a critical role to play, not simply in saying here are \nthe job skills that are needed and here's what ought to be taught, \nbut also in monitoring that excellence.  If you have the right sort \nof partnership there, the people who are paying the taxes and who are \ngoing to then be hiring the workers are not going to permit the \nsecond-rate programs to survive if they have any way to shape and \ninfluence them.  So I think that's very important.\n	     \n	     And when we try to, if you will, fill in the blanks at \nthe federal level, trying to set some standards and provide some \nfunds, one of the things that we want to be sure and do is to make \nsure that the employer has a heavy amount of influence over the \nquality of these programs, because that's really what's going to \ndetermine whether the whole thing is worthwhile.\n	     \n	     SECRETARY RILEY:  That's great.  We've been talking, of \ncourse, about school-to-work and also the jobs and economic recovery \nprogram for this summer and fall.  But let's talk just a moment about \nlong-term school reform.  It's something especially close to me.  Mr. \nPresident, I wonder if you would give us some of your ideas for the \ncommunities out here on Goals 2000 legislation that I think will be \ncoming forth before too long.\n	     \n	     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, as you know, back when you and I \nwere both governors, we spent a lot of time working on our public \nschools and we tried to be very candid with our people in saying that \na lot of these things were going to take some time to materialize.  \n	     \n	     I had a hand in writing the National Education Goals \nthat the governors drafted, along with representatives of President \nBush's administration back in 1989.  And what we're going to try to \ndo this year with your leadership is to introduce legislation in \nCongress that will actually define the things that the national \ngovernment ought to do to try to help the local schools and the \nchildren of this country and the adult learners, too, meet those \ngoals -- making sure that when -- by 2000, people show up for school \nready to learn; that we get a 90 percent on-time high school \ngraduation rate; that children at the 4th, 8th, and 12th grades are \nconfident in the subjects they're supposed to know; that they are \nsecond to none in math and science; that are schools are safe, \ndisciplined, and drug-free.  And, of course, the fifth goal --I took \nthem out of line to say this the last -- is that we have a system of \nlife-long learning in this country.\n	     \n	     And each one of those goals there's a national role, a \nstate role, a school role, school district role, and a private sector \nrole.  And what you've attempted to do in this bill you're going to \nintroduce with me in the next few weeks is to define what our job is; \nand then to give the rest of America a way of defining what their job \nis and seeing whether we're actually meeting the standards of quality \nthat we need to meet.\n	     \n	     It's very exciting.  So far as I know, nothing quite \nlike it has ever been done in the form of federal legislation before.  \nNot mandating and telling people what they have to do with their \nmoney, but actually setting up a framework for excellence and \npartnerships so that we can do our job.  I'm really excited about it.\n	     \n	     SECRETARY RILEY:  Well, I am, too.  And I think really \nit will be an entirely new role for the federal government in terms \nof its relationship with states, serving as a partner really to \nsupport and facilitate and to help out in these education reform \nefforts, all driven by high standards.  That's the point.\n	     \n	     Bob, let me ask you one question, and then we'll get to \nthe telephone calls.  It's about the same subject.  We have, of \ncourse, skills standards that are going to be part of Goals 2000, and \nI wonder if you would comment on that.\n	     \n	     SECRETARY REICH:  Well, you know, we have 75 percent of \nour young people who don't graduate from college.  Very often they \ndon't have very many alternatives.  They do have a wonderful system \nof community colleges and technical institutions, but if we had \nnational skill standards to which they could aspire and which \nemployers would understand as a national credential, many of these \nyoung people would actually find that they were much more eligible \nfor jobs.\n	     \n	     Everybody doesn't have to go to college.  Other \ncountries you have smaller proportions of their population going to \ncollege, but you have a whole level of people who have certain \ntechnical, preprofessional skills.  We can do it in this country.  If \nyou don't go to four-year college you're not a loser.  And we want to \ndevelop those national skill standards.  We're going to be working \nwith the states, with the Education Department, with a lot of private \nindustry in developing those standards.  And I think they will be the \nkinds of things that enable our vocational and technical and other \ninstitutions to rally around, as well as our business community.\n	     \n	     SECRETARY RILEY:  Well, that's great.  Why don't we go \nahead and go to the telephone.  We have a call, I see -- Mayor Bruce \nTodd of Austin, Texas.\n	     \n	     Q	  Yes, Mr. President and Mr. Secretary Reich and \nRiley, we certainly appreciate the opportunity to join you today.  We \nhave some dedicated professionals and volunteers here in Austin who \nhave heard what you have said and are very appreciative.  Let me \nsimply say, amen to some of the comments made already.  We agree with \nmuch of the tone that the Clinton administration has taken, and are \nvery supportive.  \n	     \n	     We have been successful here in Austin of tripling our \nsummer employment program over the last four years.  We expect to \nhave over 2,000 employed this year in the summertime; perhaps as much \nas 3,500 with the federal assistance.  \n	     \n	     Much of the question that we had designed you have \nanswered in your opening comments, so we must be thinking alike.  But \nthe question essentially involved what initiatives after Labor Day \nwould be appropriate.  We know summertime is important.  Year-round \nis even more important.  And what kind of initiatives at the federal \nlevel might be proposed to meet the needs of the youth on a year-\nround basis?  And perhaps more importantly, how can families and the \nlocal community be more involved using the federal initiative? That's \nsomething that we believe is very important to success in this \neffort.\n	     \n	     SECRETARY RILEY:  Mr. President.\n	     \n	     THE PRESIDENT:  I think I'll give everybody a chance to \nanswer the question, Bruce, but let me first thank you for calling, \nand thank you for all the great work that you're doing in Austin.  \nI've seen some of it and I've always been very impressed.  \n	     \n	     First, with regard to the summer program, we hope we can \nstructure it in a way that will enable us to continue the summer \nprogram and that will move a lot of these young people back into \nschools under circumstances that might allow them to do some work in \nthe private sector, too.  We hope that -- Secretary Reich is going to \ntry to set up a system where we create a lot of private sector jobs \nto be matched with the public sector jobs this summer.  And we're \nworking on that.\n	     \n	     Secondly, in the program that I have presented to the \nCongress over the next five years, what we are attempting to do is to \nbuild in an amount of investment that's quite substantial for job \ntraining programs, for school-to-work programs, all of which give \nheavy, heavy weight to local community input -- just the question you \nasked -- but do provide some federal investment dollars, which we \nhope you can put with local dollars to keep people working and being \ntrained on a year-round basis.\n	     \n	     And I will say again, to echo what Secretary Reich said \na moment ago, to try to break down the barrier between what is seen \nas work and what is seen as learning.  An awful lot of young people \nactually have quite high IQs, but actually learn so much better when \nthey're doing than when they're reading or just listening.  So we \nhope that the community involvement part of it will be permanent, and \nwe hope that if the whole budget passes -- and we do have 200 budget \ncuts and more than 200, actually, in the budget -- and some revenue \nraisers, and some new money for education and training, that we'll be \nable to do just what you seem to want based on your question.\n	     \n	     Bob, do you want to say anything?\n	     \n	     SECRETARY REICH:  Well, you took most of the words out \nof my mouth, Mr. President, as usual.  But let me just add one thing, \nand that is that one of the most important aspects of post-high \nschool for a lot of young people who are not going on to college, in \naddition to the school-to-work program, simply is the availability of \njobs.  And we've got to get this economy moving again, obviously.  \nIt's terribly important to get this recovery program, to get the \neconomy back on track.  That's sort of the prerequisite to everything \nelse.  If we don't get the economy back on track -- we have -- I \nthink this is the 16th -- correct me if I'm wrong, Mr. President -- I \nthink is the 16th month we have had seven percent unemployment or \ngreater.  This is a jobless recovery.  A lot of those kids are going \nto be getting out of school in June.  And even if we did everything \nright, they would have a very, very hard time getting jobs.\n	     \n	     SECRETARY RILEY:  Thank you both.  Of course, Goals 2000 \nwill be a permanent, long-term thing that will certainly reach into \nnext year.  It will involve, if passed -- and we certainly hope it \nwill be -- action plans with every state where we can be working \ntogether to reach for the goals in a number of different ways.  And \nthen the state, with all the various school districts, a very \nimportant part of that will be citizen and parent involvement.  And I \nthink everybody will see a great energy out there, once we get that \nmoving.\n	     \n	     The next call is Dr. Harry Heinemann, New York.  \n	     \n	     Doctor?\n	     \n	     Q	  Good evening, Mr. Secretary.  It is a pleasure to \nbe on with you this evening.  As you may know, bridging the school \nand work has been central to La Guardia's educational program since \nits inception in the 1970s, and that includes the college, the two \nalternative high schools that operate on our campus, and the linkages \nwe have forged with the local schools.  We have found this to be an \nextremely effective learning strategy.\n	     \n	     And over the years, we've come to believe that there are \nseveral principles that are very important in bridging the school and \nwork.  And these include integrating theory in the classroom with \npractice in the workplace, with providing all students early exposure \nto careers, as well as providing opportunities for them to reflect \nupon these experiences while they strengthen their skills; and \nlastly, the critical role of the liberal arts, particularly in the \ndevelopment of high performance competencies.  \n	     \n	     My question, then is:  How can the general education \nfaculty and the academic curriculum be more closely integrated with \ntransition to work experience?  And what mechanisms and strategies \ncan you suggest to achieve this integration?\n	     \n	     SECRETARY RILEY:  Well, thank you very much.  I think -- \nand we'll get a response from you all on that, and very interesting \nwork going on there.  We're going to have three people, our next \nguests on the program this evening, that will be some specialists   \nin that area that you're speaking, and I'll certainly pass that on to \nthem and we can discuss it later.\n	     \n	     You all care to comment -- any comments you might have?\n	     \n	     THE PRESIDENT:  I'd just like to say, if I might, one \nthing.  I want to reemphasize this and I don't think I'm being as \nclear about it as I'd like, although I think at least one of the \npeople who will be on the second panel will be able to say it more \nexplicitly than I.  I think this whole concept of applied academics \nis very important.  And I think that we have to basically abolish \nwhat I consider to be a very artificial distinction between what is \nvocational learning and what is academic learning.\n	     \n	     I think we should keep the liberal arts going.  I think \nwe should have a strong component for people who are in the \nvocational program.\n	     \n	     SECRETARY REICH:  It seems to me that we also need to \nrethink our entire tracking system, because a lot of these school and \nwork combinations are important for mainstream students.  They're \nimportant for all students.  It's not just a special group of \nstudents that needs them.\n	     \n	     Some of the experiments that I've seen around the United \nStates -- Dick, I'm sure you've seen them as well -- are mainstream \nexperiments.  They're mainstreaming all the students.  At 11th and \n12th grades they're giving them a combined work and school experience \nand then a transition program.  And again, the kids can either go on \nto college if they want; they can go on to technical community; they \ncan go on to an entirely -- a large variety of possibilities and \ncareer directions.\n	     \n	     But we have to get away from the stigmatizing that often \ngoes on with young people who simply are doing job-related or work-\nrelated work within the classroom, within our schools.\n	     \n	     SECRETARY RILEY:  Thank you, very much.  I think that's \ngoing to be the last call that we have time for.  Mr. President, I \nthink you've got to move on to another matter, and I want to thank \nyou and Secretary Reich for being here.  We appreciate your time and \nyour ideas, and it's been a tremendous help to us.

Well, the fact of the matter is that poverty is imperfectly related to \nsocial and political instability, while economic inequality is much more\nstrongly related.  In virtually all major revolutions including\nEngland (the Puritan revolution), France, Russia and China, the \nrevolutions occurred as economies were undergoing substantial long term \ngrowth and poverty was declining.  What sets off revolutions is massive\ninequality coupled with a perception on the part of those at the bottom\nthat social change is possible.\n\nIf "poverty (were) the main engine of social instability," this typical\nhistorical pattern would not hold.  In fact, revolutions would have been\nfar more typical before the nineteenth century than since that time.\n\n[Much deleted...]\n\n\nSorry, buddy, but some other "blowhards" managed to include the "general\nwelfare" in another portion of the constitution.\n\nArticle I Section 8: "The Congress shall have the power to lay and collect\ntaxes...to pay the debts and provide for the common defence and GENERAL\nWELFARE of the United States..."\n\nI guess they wanted to make sure everyone understood they meant what they\nsaid in the preamble.\n\n\nBut as noted above, the constitution doesn't say that, does it?\n\n\nBut since it explicitly includes both the general welfare and defense\nin Article I, Section 8, I guess you'll grant that botha are constitutional\nfunctions.

: First off they could recognise Iraqu's responsibility in initiating the\n: Iran/Iraq war. Providing technical assistance to Iran to get it's oil\n: production back up to capacity would also be a smart move, at the moment \n: Iran is above it's OPEC ceiling. If they had extra capacity they would\n: use it and bring down the oild price further which is in our interests.\n\nI agree with most of what Phill says, except the point about it being in\nour interests to bring down the oil price.  Consider that both the U.S.\nand Great Britain have domestic sources to partly satisfy \ntheir energy needs.    Pricy OPEC oil impacts both Germany,\nJapan and many other "industrial rivals" more than these two.  \nIn addition, the proceeds from the sale (especially by Saudi Arabia, Kuwait\nU.A.E. etc) are disproportionately reinvested in the U.S. and G.B., \npropping up these economies and further providing an incentive \nto keep prices from falling too low.
The cads! The fact that this is precisely what the US was up to of\ncourse is not mentioned. It is a fact that Regan and Bush sold arms\nto Iran, it is also a fact that they supported and armed Iraq.\n\nStill this is state dept propaganda so none too surprizing.\n\n\nIn the case of Lybia there is the problem that the US only decided\nthat Gadffii ordered the bombing after it needed to make peace with\ndamascus during the gulf war. One day the US is certain that its Syria,\nthe next Lybia. For a strange reason the US will not provide evidence to\nLybian courts for extradition proceedings. Faced with similar demands the\nUSA would reject them as would any other country.\n\n\n\nThe word is "terrorism".\n\n\nThe problem is that after the behaviour of George Bush the USA has an\nimage abroad as doing precisely what it likes and is in its own interests\nthen comming out with a Dysney scripted sugary justification repeating a\nfitting combination of the words "freedom" "dignity" "democaracy" or\nof "terrorism" "dictatorship" etc as appropriate.\n\nThe USA could go quite far to mend the bridges with  Iran. The people there are\nrather pissed off because the USA first supported the Shah who they\nloathed and then supported Saddam when he mounted an unprovoked attack. \nHardly surprizing after the embassy hostage crisis but Iran is meant to be\nthe country run by unreasonable bigots not the USA so if there is to be\nmovement it would be easier for the USA to move.\n\nFirst off they could recognise Iraqu's responsibility in initiating the\nIran/Iraq war. Providing technical assistance to Iran to get it's oil\nproduction back up to capacity would also be a smart move, at the moment \nIran is above it's OPEC ceiling. If they had extra capacity they would\nuse it and bring down the oild price further which is in our interests.\n\nThe Iranian clerics would have an interest in seeking a raprochment \nsimply because a permanent war footing is debilitating. They also need\nwestern technology.
THE WHITE HOUSE\n\n                    Office of the Press Secretary\n______________________________________________________________\nFor Immediate Release                             April 15, 1993     \n\n	     \n                       REMARKS BY THE PRESIDENT\n                   TO LAW ENFORCEMENT ORGANIZATIONS\n	     \n	     \n                           The Rose Garden \n\n\n2:52 P.M. EDT\n\n\n	     THE PRESIDENT:  Good afternoon.  Ladies and gentlemen, \ntwo months ago I presented a comprehensive plan to reduce our \nnational deficit and to increase our investment in the American \npeople, their jobs and their economic future.  The federal budget \nplan passed Congress in record time, and created a new sense of hope \nand opportunity in the country.  \n	     \n	     Then, the short-term jobs plan I presented to Congress, \nwhich would create a half a million jobs in the next two years passed \nthe House of Representatives two weeks ago.  It now has the support \nof a majority of the United States Senate. \n	     \n	     All of these members of Congress know it's time to get \nthe economy moving again, to get job growth going again, to get a \nfast start on the investments we need to build a lasting prosperity.  \nUnfortunately, a minority of the members of the United States Senate \nhave used gridlock tactics to prevent their colleagues from working \nthe will of the majority on the jobs bill.\n	     \n	     When Congress returns, I ask every senator from every \nstate and from both parties to remember what is at stake.  The issue \nis not politics, it's people.  Sixteen million of them are looking \nfor full-time jobs and can't find them.  These men and women don't \ncare about who's up or down in Washington.  They care about paying \nthe rent and meeting the mortgage payment, about putting food on the \ntable and buying shoes for their children, about regaining a sense of \ndignity that comes from doing a day's work and supporting their \nfamilies and drawing a paycheck.\n	     \n	     They're asking those of us who have the privilege of \nserving to put aside politics and do something now to move our \neconomy forward.  I am prepared to do that.  And I have been working \nwith the Senate to come up with an adjusted package that meets some \nof the concerns of those who have been blocking action on the jobs \nplan.  I'm willing to compromise, so long as we keep the focus on \njobs, keep the focus on growth and keep the focus on meeting unmet \nnational needs.  \n	     \n	     Our opponents have been asking for a smaller package.  \nToday I ask them to join me in determining exactly what kind and what \nsize package Congress can approve that actually meets the needs of \nthe American people. \n	     \n	     But even as we make those reductions and the package \nwill be smaller, I believe we must address problems that are on the \nminds of millions of Americans, and one in particular, and that is \nthe need to toughen law enforcement in our society to deal with the \ndramatic rise in violent crime. \n	     \n	     So I will ask, even in this reduced package, for an \nadditional $200 million in federal funding to help local communities \nto rehire police officers who have been laid off because of the \nfiscal problems caused by the national recession.  Together, with a \nmatching effort by local governments, this could put as many as \n10,000 police officers back on the job, and back on the beat in \ncommunities all across our nation.\n	     \n	     At a time when too many of our people live in fear of \nviolent crime, when too many businesses have closed and too many \npeople have lost their jobs because people are afraid to leave their \nhomes, rehiring thousands of officers is one of the best investments \nAmerica can make.  And I ask both Houses of Congress to make that \ninvestment in our people's safety and in their piece of mind.  \n	     \n	     I believe in the need for strong federal action to keep \nthe economy going toward recovery and to create jobs.  Make no \nmistake about it:  I will fight for these priorities as hard as I \never have.  I will never forget that the people sent me here to fight \nfor their jobs, their future and for fundamental change.\n	     \n	     I want to thank the police officers who are here today \nand tell you that not a single one of them knew before they came here \nthat I had determined to ask for more money in this jobs bill to \nrehire police officers.  They came here because they believe in the \nsummer jobs portion of the package.  And I want them to be free to \ntalk about that.  They came here not out of any law enforcement \nconcern other than the fact that they wanted the kids in this country \nto have a chance to have jobs this summer, to have safer streets and \na brighter and more peaceful future.\n	     \n	     I say what I say today not just because it's good for \nlaw enforcement but because it's good for the people who live in \nthese communities.  I have always supported community policing not \nonly because it helps to prevent crime and to lower the crime rate, \nbut because it cements better relationships between people in law \nenforcement and the people that they're hired to protect.  It reduces \nthe chances of abusive action by police officers and increases the \nchances of harmony and safe streets at the same time.\n	     \n	     These are the kinds of things that we are trying to do.  \nI promised in my campaign that I'd do everything I could to put \nanother 100,000 police officers on the street over the next four \nyears.  This makes a good downpayment on that.  This keeps in mind \nthe core of the jobs package.  And this will help us to move forward.  \n	     \n	     So I ask the people in the Senate who have blocked the \njobs bill, let's work together.  I can accept a reduced package if \nyou will increase your commitment to safe streets.  I do not accept \nthe fact that we should reduce our commitment to summer jobs or to \nbuilding our infrastructure or to doing those other things that will \ncreate real and lasting  prosperity for our people.  I have done my \npart now to end the gridlock; I ask you to do yours.  \n	     \n	     I want now to give the people who are here with me on \nthe platform a chance to make some remarks and to be heard by the \nAmerican people -- beginning with Janet Reno, the distinguished \nAttorney General.\n  \n	     \n	     *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   * \n	     \n	     Q	  Mr. President, can you tell us -- do you think that \nthe jobs package could be put in further jeopardy by controversy over \nthe suggestion of a VAT tax at this point in the congressional \ndialogue?\n	     \n	     THE PRESIDENT:  Not at all.  I think it should have --\nthey wouldn't have any relationship one to the other.  First of all, \nI made absolutely no decision on that.  You should know that there's \na lot of support in the business community and the labor community -- \npeople have asked us to consider that because of the enormous burden \nof the present system on many of our major employers, particularly \nmany of those that we depend upon to generate jobs and to carry the \nstrength of this economy.  But I have made absolutely no decision \nthat would even approach that on that or any other kind of general \ntax.\n	     \n	     Q	  Do you personally believe that the American public \nis ready to pay for -- to have another tax to pay for health care?  I \nmean, apart from what business and labor leaders have said --\n	     \n	     THE PRESIDENT:  I'm not going to speculate on that.  I \nwill say this:  The real issue is how quickly we can recycle the \nbenefits of all the savings to cover the cost.  I mean, that is --\neveryone knows that if you do what we're proposing to do, if you \nstreamline the insurance system, if you fix the system so that \nthere's no longer an enormous economic incentive to over-utilize or \nover-provide certain services, if you provide primary and preventive \ncare in places where it isn't now, every single analysis shows \nabsolutely massive savings to the health care system.\n	     \n	     The real question is whether you can transfer those \nsavings to cover those who have no coverage now or those who have \nvirtually no coverage so that you provide people the security.  I \nhave no idea.  The polls say that, but I don't know.  All I know is \nthe polls that I see in the press that many of you have commissioned, \nthey say overwhelmingly the American people want the security of an \naffordable health care system.\n	     \n	     But I don't think that has anything to do with this \nstimulus, and it certainly shouldn't have.  People want a job first \nand foremost.  They want that more than anything else.\n	     \n	     Q	  Now that you've announced your willingness to \ncompromise on the stimulus package, can you tell us what parts of \nyour package you consider vital and uncompromisable?  I assume summer \njobs is one.\n	     \n	     THE PRESIDENT:  I want the summer jobs; I want the \nhighway program and I want the police program.  I still intend -- let \nme say this:  I still intend to fully and aggressively push the crime \nbill, which did not pass the Congress last year.  This is a \nsupplement to that, not a substitute for it in any way.  But I think \nwe need to do that.\n	     \n	     I think we need the Ryan White funds because of the \nenormous health care burdens to the communities that are inordinately \nand disproportionately affected by the problems of caring for people \nwith AIDS.  And there are several other things that I think should be \ndone.  We have to do the Agriculture Department meat inspectors; the \nsafety of the public depends on that.  \n	     \n	     There are a number of other things that I don't -- I \ndon't think any of it should be cut, but I have given Senator \nMitchell and Senator Byrd -- I talked to them.  And Senator Dole \ncalled me yesterday to discuss this, and I told him that I would call \nhim back.  I called him back last night in New Hampshire and we \ndiscussed this.  And I basically asked them to talk today, and said \nthat I would not make any statements about any specifics until at \nleast they had a chance to talk to see whether or not they could \nreach some accord.  \n	     \n	     So I don't want to be any more specific than I have been \nalready, and let's see if they can talk it out.\n	     \n	     Q	  When you talked to Senator Dole and Senator \nMitchell did you tell them about your -- increase also, that $200 \nmillion, that you want that as part of the package?\n	     \n	     THE PRESIDENT:  I did -- I told Senator -- I left word \nfor Senator Mitchell last night about it.  When I talked to Senator \nDole -- I don't remember for sure -- I do not believe I mentioned it.  \nBut I did tell him that I was prepared to reduce the package and I \nwanted to break the gridlock, and I told him that I was working on a \nreformulation of it so that -- in the hope that it would become even \nmore focused on jobs and the kinds of issues that I thought the \nAmerican people wanted us to address.  And this is certainly \nconsistent with that.\n	     \n	     Thank you.
Their testimony would be a contradiction of the plaintiff's charge (and\nwitness) that the occupant moved after the impact, indicating he was alive and\ntrying to get out (and provoking all sorts of sympathetic 'gross, burned alive'\nreactions).\n\n\n	They are two witnesses who didn't come forth until after the first\ntrial.  While it would be "tough luck" for GM if they new about these witnesses\nbeforehand, IMO this constitutes "new evidence".\n\n\n	No, I support rulings that deny new trials on those grounds.
The following was posted and no doubt retyped by Yigal Ahrens and considering \n the importance of the issue and the almost total blackout except in \n California, I am reposting to other appropriates groups.\n \n \n \n From LA Times, Friday, April 9, 1993.  P. A1.\n \n EVIDENCE OF ADL SPY OPERATION SEIZED BY POLICE\n \n By Richard C. Paddock, Times staff writer\n \n SAN FRANCISCO -- Police on Thursday served search warrants on the\n Anti-Defamation League here and in Los Angeles, seizing evidence of a\n nationwide intelligence network accused of keeping files on more than\n 950 political groups, newspapers and labor unions and as many as\n 12,000 people.\n \n Describing the spy operation in great detail, San Francisco\n authorities simultaneously released voluminous documents telling how\n operatives of the Anti-Defamation League searched through trash and\n infiltrated organizations to gather intelligence on Arab-American,\n right-wing and what they called "pinko" organizations.\n \n Representatives of the Anti-Defamation League, a well-known\n organization in the U.S. Jewish community dedicated to fighting\n anti-Semitism, declined detailed comment Thursday but denied breaking\n any laws.\n \n Police allege that the organization maintains undercover operatives to\n gather political intelligence in at least seven cities, including Los\n Angeles and San Francisco.\n \n Groups that were the focus of the spy operation span the political\n spectrum, including such groups as the Ku Klux Klan, the White Aryan\n Resistance, Operation Rescue, Greenpeace, the National Assn. for the\n Advancement of Colored People, the United Farm Workers and the Jewish\n Defense League.  Also on the list were Mills College, the board of\n directors of San Francisco public television station KQED and the San\n Francisco Bay Guardian newspaper.\n \n People who were subjects of the spy operation included former\n Republican Rep. Pete McCloskey, jailed political extremist Lyndon H.\n LaRouche and Los Angeles Times foreign correspondent Scott Kraft, who\n is based in South Africa.\n \n Authorities said much of the material collected by the groups was\n confidential information obtained illegally from law enforcement\n agencies.  They also alleged that data on some individuals and\n organizations was sold separately to the South African government.\n \n In addition to allegations of obtaining confidential information from\n police, the Anti-Defamation League could face a total of 48 felony\n counts for not properly reporting the employment of its chief West\n Coast spy, Roy Bullock, according to the affidavit filed to justify\n the search warrant.\n \n The Anti-Defamation League disguised payments to Bullock for more than\n 25 years by funneling $550 a week to Beverly Hills attorney Bruce I.\n Hochman, who then paid Bullock, according to the documents released in\n San Francisco.  Hochman, a former president of the Jewish Federation\n Council of Greater Los Angeles and one of the state's leading tax\n attorneys, will be out of the city until late next week and could not\n be reached for comment, his office said.\n \n Until 1990, Hochman, a former U.S. prosecutor, also was a member of a\n panel appointed by then-Sen. Pete Wilson to secretly make initial\n recommendations on new federal judges in California.  Hochman is a\n former regional president of the Anti-Defamation League.\n \n The league, which initially cooperated with police, has denied\n repeatedly that its intelligence-gathering operation broke any laws.\n League officials will not confirm or deny whether Bullock was an\n employee and have said they simply traded information with police\n departments about people who might be involved in hate crimes.\n \n But in an affidavit filed to obtain warrants for Thursday's searches,\n San Francisco police alleged that "ADL employees were apparently less\n than truthful" in providing information during an earlier search\n conducted without a warrant.\n \n David Lehrer, executive director of the Los Angeles ADL office, said\n the organization has not violated the law.  "There is nothing\n nefarious about how we operate or what we have done," he said.  "Our\n record speaks for itself."\n \n The police affidavit contends that Lehrer had sole control of a secret\n fund used to pay for "fact-finding operations."  Lehrer, according to\n the documents, signed checks from the account under the name L.\n Patterson.\n \n An ADL official said the account was used to pay for subscriptions to\n a wide variety of extremist publications that might balk at sending\n them directly to the Anti-Defamation League.\n \n Bullock, 58, who has been collecting intelligence for the ADL for\n nearly 40 years, defended his efforts during a lengthy interview with\n San Francisco police.  He said that he gathered names from many\n sources and entered them into his computer under headings such as\n "Skins" and "Pinkos," but that did not necessarily mean that they were\n under surveillance.\n \n "I might never see or call up on 99% of them again," Bullock said.\n "And it doesn't mean anything that they're in the files.  It's not a\n threat to anyone's civil rights that a name appears in my files under,\n say, 'Pinko.'"\n \n In recent years, Bullock worked closely with San Francisco Police\n Officer Tom Gerard, who fled to the Phillippines last fall after he\n was questioned by the FBI in the case.\n \n A former CIA employee, Gerard supplied Bullock with criminal records\n and Department of Motor Vehicles information such as home addresses,\n vehicle registration, physical characteristics and drivers license\n photographs.\n \n Using files gathered for the Anti-Defamation League, Gerard and\n Bullock also provided information to the South African government,\n receiving $16,000 over four years, the documents show.\n \n The file on Times staff writer Kraft, which was apparently sold to the\n South African government, provides some insight into the hit-and-miss\n nature of the spy operation.\n \n The file notes that Kraft's articles "appear frequently in The Times\n and are well researched and written," but little else about the file\n is accurate.  The brief entry confuses The Times' Kraft with another\n Scott Kraft and provides the South African government with the wrong\n Kraft's physical description, photograph and other personal\n information.\n \n Nevertheless, the documents provide illuminating details of how\n Bullock for decades infiltrated all manner of organizations, from\n skinheads to left-wing radicals, searching regularly through the trash\n of target groups.  Using Anti-Defamation League funds, he also ran his\n own paid informants under code names such as "Scott" and "Scumbag."\n \n He worked closely with police officers up and down the coast,\n exchanged information with the FBI and worked with federal agencies,\n including the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.\n \n It was Bullock's work as a paid informant for the FBI -- while spying\n on behalf of the Anti-Defamation League and the South African\n government -- that proved his undoing. The FBI learned that he was an\n agent of a foreign government and began investigating, leading to the\n probe of the Anti-Defamation League's intelligence network.  The\n Anti-Defamation League employed undercover operatives to gather\n information in Los Angeles, San Francisco, New York, Washington,\n Chicago, St. Louis and Atlanta, according to the affidavit and\n investigators.  Joining San Francisco police in searching league\n offices and a Los Angeles bank were investigators from the office of\n San Francisco Dist. Atty. Arlo Smith and the state Franchise Tax\n Board.  The Los Angeles Police Department, which earlier refused to\n cooperate with the investigation, was informed of the searches in Los\n Angeles but not invited to participate.  Investigators suspect that\n some confidential information in the Anti-Defamation League files may\n have come from Los Angeles police officers.\n \n \n \n From Los Angeles Times, Saturday, April 10, 1993.  P. A23.\n \n ADL VOWS TO COOPERATE WITH SPY INVESTIGATION\n \n By Richard C. Paddock, Times staff writer.\n \n SAN FRANCISCO -- The Anti-Defamation League defended its record as a\n civil rights group Friday and said it will cooperate with authorities\n who are investigating whether the organization collected confidential\n police information on citizens and groups.\n \n But San Francisco Dist. Atty. Arlo Smith said that Anti-Defamation\n League employees involved in intelligence gathering could face many\n felony counts of receiving confidential files, eavesdropping, tax\n violations and conspiracy.\n \n Police have accused the Anti-Defamation League of not being truthful\n about its spying operations, which collected information on more than\n 12,000 individuals and 950 political groups across the political\n spectrum.\n \n Hundreds of pages of documents released by prosecutors Thursday show\n that the ADL maintained a nationwide intelligence network and kept\n files on political figures.\n \n Even so, Smith suggested that if the Anti-Defamation League shut down\n its spy operation, prosecutors would take that into account when\n deciding what charges to file.\n \n In a statement released in Washington, National Director Abraham H.\n Foxman described the ADL as "a Jewish defense agency which has fought\n to protect all minorities from bigotry and discrimination for 80\n years."\n \n Foxman said the organization is regarded as a credible source on\n extremist groups and has a tradition of routinely providing\n information to police, journalists, academics, government officials\n and the public.  It has never been the policy of the ADL to obtain\n information illegally, he said.\n \n "Like other journalists, in order to protect the confidentiality and\n physical safety of its sources, ADL will not comment on the nature or\n identity of any source of information," Foxman said.\n \n The Anti-Defamation League refused to acknowledge that one of its\n longtime employees, Roy Bullock, was anything more than "a private\n individual who is alleged to be an ADL 'informant.'"\n \n Among the documents released by prosecutors were detailed statements\n showing how the ADL funneled weekly payments to Bullock through\n Beverly Hills attorney Bruce I. Hochman.\n \n "Roy would penetrate organizations and needed this arrangement to be\n distanced from ADL," Hochman told a San Francisco police investigator.\n Hochman could not be reached Friday at his home or office for comment.\n \n Despite the Anti-Defamation League's assertion that it will cooperate\n with authorities, San Francisco police said the group did not turn\n over all pertinent documents during a voluntary search of the group's\n offices in Los Angeles and San Francisco last fall.\n \n A second round of searches Thursday, this time with search warrants,\n produced a vast quantity of records, primarily dealing with financial\n transactions, Smith said.  Further searches may be necessary and it\n will be at least a month before any charges are filed, he said.\n \n "The investigation, of course, will go wherever the facts lead us,"\n the district attorney said.
GOT HIM!  Cramer is now claiming that pedophilia is a sexual orientation\nrather than a chronicly homosexual condition.  This changes the whole\nargument in as much that is pedophilia is a sexual orientation all\nof its own peds cannot be called homosexual.  Peds are peds who\nmay have a preference as to the sex of the child they molest (though\nmost do not have a preference) but that is a subset of their basic\nped nature.\n\nCramer has as much as admitted that peds and gay men are different\norientations.  All we need now is to get him to admit that\nthe apparent similarities he keeps on about are just optical illusions.\n\nxavier

As a libertarian (with a small l) who voted for Clinton, I think that he\nshould abolish the Selective Service and the draft.  If his conscience\nforbade him to go to war in Vietnam, it should forbid him to perpetuate\nthis system of government-sanctioned slavery.\n\n\nIf our government would pay attention to SERIOUS domestic issues (the ECONOMY)\nand choose to stay out of other people's wars (Iraq, Bosnia, Somalia),\nwe would not be in this fix.  An anyway, couldn't the jobs be replaced by\nimproving our domestic situation?  (I'm not for continued deficit spending,\nbut if Clinton and Congress want to spend, I'd rather they improve the \ninfrastructure than fight other people's wars.)\n\n\nA novel idea:  Getting away from naval bases, what about refurbishing\ndecommissioned Air Force bases as airports?  This would be SO much cheaper\nthan building them from the ground up (Denver's new airport is one of the \nmost appalling examples of pork-barreling and cronyism I have seen in\nmy lifetime).  Even if no more airports are needed, I'm sure Bill Gates\nor Ross Perot would LOVE to have their own private airfields, and the\nmoney from their purchases could be applied to the public debt.

Such connotations\nare quite explicit in the sayings of the Buddha who called his religion the\neightfold Aryan path.   The word was borrowed by the German scholar\nMax Mueller who used it as a synonym for `indo-european', but then the\nNazis proceeded to steal it and started pretending that `aryan' is\nsynonymous with `nordic' which seems highly unlikely.  The people who\noriginally called themselves aryas,  the Iranians, Noprth Indians, the Afghans\nand possibly the Kurds, are none of them nordic.  So the use of the word\nby Westerners, though meant with apparent good humor in this case, is\nnontheless inappropriate.  The only Westerners who may have some claim\nto call themselves Aryans (by descent) are the Celts who seem to have wor-\nshipped a god called Aryaman who is mentioned in the Rigveda.\n\n  If you want to check what I am saying, look at  Mallory's book, ``In\nsearch of the Indo-Europeans" or, just look at the Encyclopedia Britannica.\nThe reason this usage is offensive is that most of Ancient Indian literature\nas well as religion is directly or inderectly due to the Aryans and\nfor Westerners to butt in is really not nice, not to mention the horrible\nthings done by Germans to Jews, using a word to which the Germans have\nno clear claim.
#1\n\nClayton, my man...\n\nYou are a tad out of touch....\n\nFirst, gay comunities all over the country are in the process of excluding NAMBLA\nfrom parades etc.\n\n#2\n\nNobody from NAMBLA is gonna get a job in a day care centre.  The same liberals you are\nupset about are also passing laws that make tough background checks for childcare\npeople.\n\n#3\n\nTell me, how would you feel if your employer fired you for your antigay post on the\ninternet?  Would you be upset ?  I`ll bet you would be pissed!\nTo some, your posts ,ight make the company look bad.\nWhile your posts offend me I dont think it would be right for you to get fired over\nit.\n\nI dont believe the gay comunity is asking for hiring quotas like the affirmative\naction laws of the 60's did.\nMy understanding is that the gay community just wants the same rights the srtraights\nhave.  I dont think people should have their leases cancelled when their landlord\nfinds out they are gay.  I dont think that when someone sees someone walk out of\na gay business and then blabs it all over work that the gay person gets fired.\nDo you REALLY think these are justified ?\n\n#4\n\nClayton, I am told you are a parent a couple times over.\nHave you been following the strip in the paper "For Better or For Worse" ?\n\nI honestly want your opinion as a parent on the strip.  \n\nDo you really care about your childeren\nas much as friends of mine tell me ?  How much do you care about your childeren ?\nHow much do you care about other people's childeren?  Do you care about MY childeren?\nDo you care about my sister's childeren ?\n\nIf one of your kids told you he/she was gay, would you throw them out of your home\nin the middle of the night?\n\nWould you approve of your childeren driving down to San Francisco to trow bottles\nat and beat up on gay people?  Would you condone your childeren beating up on someone\nelses childeren ?

With yet another tax being floated by the Clinton administration to\npay for new ``free'' social programs, I've really begun to suspect\nthat the Canadians, long resentful of their place in the American\nshadow, brainwashed an American draft dodger who fled to Canada some\ntime between 1966 and 1968, tutored him in the ways of Canadian\nsocialism, awarded him with smokeless marijuana cigarettes when he got\nthe correct answers, then returned him to the states (under the\ncontrol of the domineering wife assigned to his case) to attain high\npublic office and destroy the evil individualistic and free market\nforces in America, thus shaping America in the Canadian image.
demon@desire.wright.edu (Not a Boomer) writes...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst, people should be aware that Brett's (no last name listed) \nposts on bit.listserv.politics indicate that he has been  \nhostile toward GM's hiring policies and to the Moseley verdict \nwhen it came out.  Equal opportunity disagreement, I guess.  :-)\n\nMy guess, without seeing the judge's opinion, is that GM's motion \nwas denied on due diligence grounds.  Otherwise, a party to a \ncase could always keep one or two semi-credible witnesses in \nreserve to spring if they lose.  Not exactly a way to promote \nrepose.\n\n						Daniel Reitman
In order of your questions, I oppose it, I oppose it, I oppose it and\n(Huh?  Wha?  Where did _that_ topic come from and what's it got to do\nwith the discussion at hand? :-)\n\nWhen I was discussing the concept of different criminal laws for crimes\nagainst different classes of people (and yes, I do consider laws which\nallow/mandate enhanced penalties following conviction based upon the\nconvict's attitudes towards the class membership of the victim to fit\ninto that category), the category of classes I had in mind was that of\nthe standard civil rights discussion -- classes based upon race, gender,\nethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, etc.  Having you ask about\nclasses based upon one's _profession_ rather than one's personal\ncharacteristics caught me off guard, and I had to think out the question\nfrom scratch.\n\nWhat I finally decided was that the law should not recognize such\nclasses because to do so would be to formally and officially declare\nsome people to be of more worth than others, and that would be anathema\nto the underlying American concept of equal treatment under the law.\n\nLast year, when a federal crime bill was under consideration which would\nhave expanded the federal death penalty to an additional fifty-plus\ncrimes, including the murder of various federal officers hitherto not\nprotected by that "aura of deterrence," critics pointed out the\nabsurdity of having laws which made the death penalty available for the\nmurder of a federal postal inspector but not for ther murder of a\ncivilian teacher, when the latter [arguably] provided a much more\nvalueable service and therefore would be the greater loss to society.\nThis was an emotionally compelling argument, but even the proponents of\nthat viewpoint appeared to tacitly assume that the state should judge\nsome lives as being more valuable than others on the basis of their\n"contribution to society."  I view that doctrine as being both (a)\npersonally repugnant and (b) repugnant to the Equal Protection clause of\nthe 14th Amendment.\n\nAccordingly, I believe that there should be no laws which give any\nprofession-based class of people special protection (via the mechanism\nof supplying stronger statutory deterrence of crimes against members of\nthat class), not even police officers, federal officers or high-ranking\nmembers of the Executive Branch of the federal government.

Correlational data can help establish a theory, but it does not\nprove anything.\n\n\nHeroin _is_ a relatively safe drug.  What makes it unsafe are IV administration\nand shit like adulterants.  There are side effects, like withdrawal, but they\neffect people differently.  \n\n\nStereotypical statement.

(or at least I haven't been arguing this).  there is not enough\ndata to form a scientific conclusion.  that _doesn't_ mean that cannabis\nis benign to users' lungs.  we can form all the theories we want, but they\nare only theories.  some theories are supported by more evidence than others,\nand that makes them stronger.  \n\n\nthe hell I can't!  they state *UN-JUSTIFIED CONCLUSIONS* *AS FACT* as\na *POLITICAL* strategy to stop drug use.\n\n[...]\n\nIn general, I somewhat see what you're saying.

It's not what they did that matters.  It's what *you* do and\nwhat *I* do and what *we* do in response that matters.  Do we\nlessen ourselves by killing in response to killing?  It's\nvengeance.  That's all.  It's no deterrent.

I'll revisit my\nopinion on the death penalty when there are more whites up for\nit than blacks.  I.e., when hell freezes over.
The fact that she was wearing a miniskirt with no underwear was\npresented as evidence that she was a prostitute, and the court\napparently found this compelling.\n\n\nClayton does indeed know the difference.

Once again, it appears that the one-eyed man has appeared in the land of the sighted\nand for some strange resaon has appointed himself the ruler and supreme power.
Your comment here is meant as a put down. It fails for several reasons :\n\n1) You have edited out the context of the action under discussion. \n2) I never brought the legal definition up. I use the English language\nand not the legal dialect. The legal definition of fraud changes from\none country to another in any case. The context of the discussion is morality\nof censorship.\n\n\n\n\nYou are extrapolating from the statement I made concerning a circumstance\nin which such an act of censorship would be permissable to the Teel case.\nIf you had bothered to read the post instead of trying to prove how stupid you\nthought me you would have done rather better. The mode of argument I was using\nwas a form of rhetoric. Argument by example, I describe a wide set of\ncircumstances in which an action is permisable and demonstrate that they\ndo not apply, thus the action is not permisable.\n\nObviously a company posting from a University adress would be squashed,  it\nwould be contrary to the internet comercial use.\n\n\nNow you are clutching at straws. In the context of the discussion it was\nthe fact of association between the company and the post that was important.\nThe typeface etc is inconsequential.\n\n\n\nIf you are implying that I am lying I suggest you read Mark Holohan and Ulick\nStaffords posts into soc.culture.british. If you are suggesting that \nadvocating murder is a trivial matter I would prefer that you state it\ndirectly. \n\nCertainly I oppose the right of Dr Sidiqui and the Ayatolah Khomenhi to\ncall for the murder of Salman Rushdie. Incitement to murder is not part\nof what I consider legitimate freedom of speech.\n\n\n\nThat is irrelevant, the case is not the incremental cost but the facility\ncost. If I decide that a company I am associated with should subscribe\nto USEnet that usenet connection is the property of the company. It is\nquite legitimate for a company to have a political or other agenda and\nregulate the use of its property in accordance with its policy. For example\nif a Microsoft employee were to post "Windows NT is crap don't buy it"\nfrom a Microsoft machine I would consider it reasonable for Microsoft to\nsack that employee. In the same way if a company decides that it has \npolitical objectives it might wish to regulate postings in a political\nmanner. This is no worse than Rupert Murdoch using his papers as a political\nplatform for his views.\n\n\n\nah yes you did not quote them, merely refered to them.\n\n\n\nYour article consisted of a reference to the first ammendment, your signature\nand pretty well damn all else. \n\n\n\nAre you refering to the initial hearings on an injunction or the judgments\non the substantive case?\n\nThe initial hearings that the government won were judged on the not unresonable\njudgment that assertion by the government that the national interest might be\nharmed would be grounds for prior restraint. The second set of hearings on the\nsubstance judged that the government had no case and that the official secrets\nact could not be used to suppress information in thwe public domain already.\nThe part that they won was over the copyright issue which is rather separate.\n\nHere again the issue of censorship is rather different in the case that\ninformation is divulged on the understanding that it will not be communicated\nto third parties. The first ammendment certainly does not apply in this\ncase as the numerous prosecutions of spies in the US proves. \n\nThe crux of the Spycatcher affair was extrateritoriality of British law.\nThe censorship aspect of it arose as a result of the government's\nludicrous attempts to prevent summary of the case in the book. \n\n\n\nFunny I saw that as a rejection of an assertion that you had made. Of course in\nrejecting an assertion I have to make a contrary assertion, since this assertion\nis unprovable I left it at that. \n\nSo far I have not seen you demonstrate a command of the contrary opinion to your\nown. You are attacking my anti-censorship view because I dare to accept the\nvalidity of some pro-censorship arguments while rejecting their conclusions. \nPlus I am not an absolutist. I have this funny idea that the solution to this\nproblem was not decided in 1789 by a group of white male gentry in secret\nsession and sumarized in a single line. Furthermore I don't think that the\nissues are half as simple as you imply.\n\n\nI don't think that you have geered your discourse to any audience save that\nof proving that you are the only person wearing a white hat.

THE WHITE HOUSE\n  \n                    Office of the Press Secretary\n  \n  _______________________________________________________________\n  \n  For Immediate Release	   	     	           April 14, 1993\n  \n  \n                 TEXT OF A LETTER FROM THE PRESIDENT\n                        TO THE SPEAKER OF THE\n                    HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES AND\n               THE PRESIDENT PRO TEMPORE OF THE SENATE\n  \n  \n                           April 13, 1993\n  \n  \n  Dear Mr. Speaker:      (Dear Mr. President:)\n  \n  As part of my continuing effort to keep the Congress fully \n  informed, I am providing this report, consistent with section 4 \n  of the War Powers Resolution, to advise you of actions that I \n  have ordered in support of the United Nations efforts in \n  Bosnia-Herzegovina.\n  \n  Beginning with U.N. Security Council Resolution 713 of \n  September 25, 1991, the United Nations has been actively \n  addressing the crisis in the former Yugoslavia.  The Security \n  Council acted in Resolution 781 to establish a ban on all \n  unauthorized military flights over Bosnia-Herzegovina.  There \n  have, however, been blatant violations of the ban, and villages \n  in Bosnia have been bombed.\n  \n  In response to these violations, the Security Council decided, \n  in Resolution 816 of March 31, 1993, to extend the ban to all \n  unauthorized flights over Bosnia-Herzegovina and to authorize \n  Member States, acting nationally or through regional organi-\n  zations, to take all necessary measures to ensure compliance.  \n  NATO's North Atlantic Council (NAC) agreed to provide NATO air \n  enforcement for the no-fly zone.  The U.N. Secretary General \n  was notified of NATO's decision to proceed with Operation DENY \n  FLIGHT, and an activation order was delivered to participating \n  allies.\n  \n  The United States actively supported these decisions.  At my \n  direction, the Joint Chiefs of Staff sent an execute order to \n  all U.S. forces participating in the NATO force, for the conduct \n  of phased air operations to prevent flights not authorized by \n  the United Nations over Bosnia-Herzegovina.  The U.S. forces \n  initially assigned to this operation consist of 13 F-15 and \n  12 F-18A fighter aircraft and supporting tanker aircraft.  \n  These aircraft commenced enforcement operations at 8:00 a.m. \n  e.d.t. on April 12, 1993.  The fighter aircraft are equipped for \n  combat to accomplish their mission and for self-defense.\n  \n  NATO has positioned forces and has established combat air \n  patrol (CAP) stations within the control of Airborne Early \n  Warning (AEW) aircraft.  The U.S. CAP aircraft will normally \n  operate from bases in Italy and from an aircraft carrier in the \n  Adriatic Sea.  Unauthorized aircraft entering or approaching \n  the no-fly zone will be identified, interrogated, intercepted, \n  escorted/monitored, and turned away (in that order).  If these \n  steps do not result in compliance with the no-fly zone, such \n  aircraft may be engaged on the basis of proper authorization by \n  NATO military authorities and in accordance with the approved \n  \n                                more\n  \n       	    	      	   	     	       	    (OVER)\n\n                                  2\n  \n  rules of engagement, although we do not expect such action will \n  be necessary.  The Commander of UNPROFOR (the United Nations \n  Protection Force currently operating in Bosnia-Herzegovina) was \n  consulted to ensure that his concerns for his force were fully \n  considered before the rules of engagement were approved.\n  \n  It is not possible to predict at this time how long such \n  operations will be necessary.  I have directed U.S. armed forces \n  to participate in these operations pursuant to my constitutional \n  authority as Commander in Chief.  I am grateful for the con-\n  tinuing support that the Congress has given to this effort, and \n  I look forward to continued cooperation as we move forward \n  toward attainment of our goals in this region.\n  \n       	    	      	   	Sincerely,\n  \n  \n  \n  \n       	    	      	   	WILLIAM J.

Considering that Clinton received a draft notice and got out of it (he admits it) the political feasibility of him abolishing it is not something he would\nbe inclined to risk any extra exposure on.\n\n\nIf you read Aviation Week, the C-5 line can be reopened and the C-5s\nwould be delivered a year earlier and cost a billion less for the \nprogram. Politically, though, the C-17 is popular pork.\n\nAgreed. Congress took money from NASA and FHA to fund the second Seawolf.\nThe shipyards are still building Los Angeles Class submarines and there\nis a lack of ASW foes to contend with. The Navy is considering reducing\nthe number of attack subs to 40 (Navy Times) and that would entail\ngetting rid of or mothballing some of the current Los Angeles class.\n\nPolitically, General Dynamics is in Connecticut and we will get\nSeawolf subs whether we need them or not.\n\nIn addition, more bases need to be closed. Probably Long Beach Naval Station\nand others. The Navy is talking about three main bases on each coast being \nrequired to home port a total fleet of 320 ships.\n\nThe question is whether Les Aspin and Clinton will be able to face down\na pork happy Congress.
I totally agree.  Really, the only people this is going to benefit, are\nthose who live in the cities where the train stops.  Who wants to drive\nto the train station from X (Lubbock for example)?  It's probably farther\nto drive to the train station than it is to the nearest national airport.
Alan, you can start by teaching your children that the perpetrators\nof crimes no more represent the "Black community" than racist hateful Whites\nrepresent the majority culture (although there are many ethnic minorities\nwho have fallen into the very trap that you are struggling with, and believe\notherwise). The trap is the easy way out.\n	For yourself, I think it would be a good idea to realize that the\ndemographics related to the crimes you speak of have less to do with race,\nand much to do with socioeconomic status and disenfranchisement. You're\ngoing to find higher crime within *any* community comprised of *any* ethnic\ngroup or subgroup that has become dysfunctional, whatever the factors\nleading to that dysfunction. With ethnic minorities it is more usually than\nnot, as I said, socioeconomic disenfranchisement.\n	If, for example, you lived in an area where there were very few\nBlacks, but quite a few poor-for-generations Whites, you'd see the crime\nstatistics reflecting the dysfunction of those White people. Would you then\nworry about whther your children would begin to see Whites as undesireable\nor whatever? The trap springs into action when our innate compunction to\ndefine "us" and "other" raises its little voice. The trap becomes dangerous\nwhen we stop to listen to that little voice and stop thinking like rational\nhumans.\n	It's interesting that Blacks are traditionally seen as *the* or the\n*most* criminal element in many of our urban areas. I don't know the racial\nmakeup of Phoenix, so I can't speak to your situation. However, I live in\nSan Francisco, a city that loves to tout its "ethnic diversity". Here, we\nhave Black gangs, Hispanic gangs, Asian (yes, the "model minority") gangs,\nand even a few White gangs. The Asian gangs have become a particularly\ntroublesome element for law enforcement here, mainly due (I think) to their\npropensity for engaging in organized criminal activities. But ask people on\nthe street and they'll, 8-out-of-10 times, tell you that Black gangs and\ncrime are what they most fear. During the "disturbance" in Los Angeles last\nyear many of the rioters and looters were not Black. Some were even White! I\nremember being amazed at  television news scenes that showed looting mobs\nwhere there were maybe one or two Blacks at most! My perceptions, gleaned\nfrom TV news, were further corroborated by numerous friends and relatives\nthat live in Los Angeles. This may have been the country's first truly\nmulti-ethnic riot. Yet I know from face-to-face and online discussion that\nin the minds of America the popular perception is that it was a *Black*\nriot!\n	In closing, I'd like to say that you raise some interesting points\nthat really need discussion. Our country has spent too long ignoring the\nracism (and its attendant ills) that is very much a part of our culture. As\na people, we are afraid to face up to some hurtful truths, and the problem\nbecomes compounded *daily*. We cannot afford to do it much longer. I truly\nbelieve that the  well-being of ALL OF US depends on changing our current\ncourse of denial and repression.\n	I wish you and your children, and all other people, of *all* colors,\nluck in avoiding the "trap". \n	Peace, my brother.\n			m.\n--
Last night I heard something about Bill Clinton's sister being\ninvolved in a marijuana bust, and the news being suppressed. I also\nheard something about her being an "ex-con". This source is not\nreliable, though. (It was a collage/booklet advertising a local band.)\n\nCan anyone on the net verify this or provide more details? I'm\nsurprised I haven't seen anything about this in this newsgroup.\n\nAlso, does anyone know what happened to the charges that Shalala was a\nregular pot smoker when she was in college? This ghastly accusation\nwas reported on CNN Streamline News the day she was nominated, then I\nnever heard anything about it again.\n\nIt's almost enough to make me want to start an Act-Up type campaign\nto invade the privacy of closet smokers! (If only this type of\npublicity didn't violate people's rights. . . .)\n\nJake.
When you force people to associate with others against their will,\nyes.
Yes, I have!  Wasn't there a case of a single lion ruling all the land\nfrom South Africa up to Egypt across to the congo?  If my memory serves\nme correctly there was enough game to feed some 100,000 or more lions but he\nwouldn't let the other lions hunt as he wanted it all himself.\n\nHe died of a heart attack brought on by being overweight.\n\nGood thing too as he had designs on Europe, America (north and south),\nand the Falkland Islands.
: \n: No.  I make a distinction between working for yourself to survive and\n: paying dues to Mother Nature in the form of labour and working for\n: Joe propertyowner because you do not have the option of working for\n: yourself.  Joe propertyowner stands between you and the earth you\n: work and expects you to pay him *and* mother nature for the right\n: to survive.  The property laws create a layer of parasites that get\n: fat on the fact that people have *no option* except to work in\n: factories.  \n: \nI want people to be able to get the things they need in life.  Property\nownership may not be ideal, but it is far better at letting people get\nwhat they need to live a productive, fulfulling life.\n\nThe first experiment in America, where property ownership was denied,\ncaused, starvation, hunger, and death.  Few people know that the\nPilgrims originally tried to have common property to grow food and a\ncommon food store.  Many people know the hardships they suffered the\nfirst few winters because of it.  After arriving, the Pilgrims made all\nproperty common.  They all shared in the work and the resulting crops\nwent into a common store.  After much debate the new Governor Bradford\nprivitized the land; assigning plots to each family.  According to Perry\nD. Westbrook:  "The change was immediately justified by the increased\nindustry of the inhabitants and by the larger acreage planted."\n\nexperience that was had in this common course and condition, tried\nsundry years and that amongst godly and sober men, may well evince the\nvanity of that conceit of Plato's and other ancients applauded by some of\nlater times; that the taking away of property and bringing in community into\na commonwealth would make them happy and flourishing; as if they were wiser\nthan God.  For this community (so far as it was) was found to breed much\nconfusion and discontent and retard much employment that would have been\nto their benefit and comfort."\n\nBradford did not blame this failure on the "strangers", but on the basic\nselfishness in all men.  He wrote "seeing all men have this corruption in\nthem, God in his wisdom saw another course fitter for them."  In other\nwords, according to Westbrook, "Bradford found private enterprise to be\nthe most suitable economic policy for mankind in its fallen state."\n\nLet's not make the same mistake that the Pilgrims made.  Private\nproperty allows a society to flourish, the alternative brings\nstarvation, poverty and discontent.
Just observed at the National Model United Nations here in NYC.\n    Just one word on it : AWSOME.\n                                 Peace, matt
es:\n.C\n\nExcuse me for sticking my nose in, but any parent/parents who do not allready \nimmunize their children (especially if it is already free), don't deserve one \nfrigging dime of tax money for health care for themselves, or public health \ncare service.\n\n(I know the immunization program and the coming national health care issue are \nslightly seperate issues, but anybody who wouldn't help their kids, don't \ndeserve my tax help).
Undoubtedly.  In fact, it is the fact that hospitals frequently compete\nfor physicians rather than for patients that (in part) complicates and \nundermines a simplistic free-market analysis of the market for medical care.\n\n\nOnce again, there is no evidence that this is true in regard to kidney\ndialysis.  Although price controls have promoted an expansion of services\nto a much greater volume of patients, RD is still a profitable service.\nOtherwise, one would expect to see evidence of rationing rather than the\nvast expansion that has occurred.\n\n\nCan you spell "loss leader?"  I knew you could.  Grocery stores do not\nattempt to make up the loss on an individual product by selling more of\nit.  In fact, your argument above is that kidney dialysis is a loss leader \nfor other medical treatments where lost revenue can be regained.  \n\nBut the evidence does not support this contention.  Rather, it appears that\nprice controls have disciplined the market by forcing an expansion of\nservice and development of improved lower-cost technology to provide \ncomparable benefits.  Providers continue to profit from RD, they simply\nmake less on each treatment than they would have if the price had \nrisen at the rate that uncontrolled treatments have.\n\nThere is no question that had price controls forced the price of RD \nsubstantially below its actual cost that some or all of the doomsday\npredictions of free-market advocates would have been seen -- restriction\nof service, lagging technological development, etc.  Likewise, it appears\nthat in the VA and armed forces medical care systems, where providers \nare government agencies, some of these negative impacts may occur.  \n(RD patients in the VA system in Spokane, for example, must travel to\nSeattle, 300 miles away, for treatment.)  \n\nThe bottom line, however, is that this is an example of government \nintervention (of a rather extreme sort) that appears to have had beneficial\nresults for both providers and consumers.  Claims that "government\nbureaucracy" inevitably leads to undesirable outcomes in the marketplace\nshould take such such cases into account.\n\njsh
No.  The REAL question:  Should the Feds bail-out IBM ( a la Chrysler )\n  so that important $80K manufacturing jobs wouldn't be lost?
Don't be ridiculous, Kaldis. I suggest you give the "Ugly American"\nconcept, which I can easily see you demonstrating, a good hard second look.\n\n\n    Dear God. Didn't this die out in the fifties with McCarthy and the\nblacklists?\n\n\n    Didn't your mother ever teach you not to generalize? I am a Canadian, and\nI stand up for _too many_ things with _too much_ certitude. \n\n\n    Uh huh. This must explain the world reknowned, record low American crime\nrate. I see now, it's all becoming so clear to me.\n\n\n    No he hasn't.\n\n\n    Remarkable audacity and misguidance. What you take for your own courage,\nsir, is nothing more than simple loud-mouthedness coupled with unrestrained\nbragging.
I'm all in favor of drug legalization, but I do see some problems with\nit. My hope is that people disposed to doing so would simply overdose\nquickly, and be done with it, before making a mess of thisgs.
Well, I don't think your query was exactly polite, but I will TRY to\ngive you a polite responce.  Something atypical of the net, but here it goes.\n\n       Black is a descriptive adjective that describes Mr. King.  From many\nof the newspaper, radio, and tv news reports I have seen, this adjective      \nis commonly in front of his name.  I have NEVER seen anyone complain about\nthe use of this adjective when used in a benign manner.  I did not say that\nMr. King was a no good black!  I do not know Mr. King and would not make this\nascertian without some evidence to this effect.  I used it PURELY as a \ndescriptive adjective in the same manner than many ( most ) news people have\nused it in the past.\n\n\n      The entire second trial was about race, Ted.  I don't feel compelled to\ndiscuss Mr. King's racial background, but had Mr. King been white there would\nnot have been a second trial.  You probably are saying that the beating would\nnot have occurred if he were white, but that is an extremely difficult call\nto make.  It is possible the case, but not definately.  \n\n      I still think your actions are crap, Ted.  They are far more divisive than\nme using the adjective 'black' in a non-derogenory manner.  Would you have\nbeen happier if I had used 'African-american' ?  If so, then you really are\nlost in the world of PC.  You have already been instrumental in getting one\npersons net access revoked, and I wonder if you have sent a copy of my \nmessage to my sys admin with a plea that I am not worthy of posting.
#That describes some straights -- and nearly all homosexual males.\n\nCan you provide any evidence that doesn't ahve massive selection\neffects?\n\nNo, I thought not.\n\nJust slander on your part.
I recommend the book "Adams _v_ Texas", the story of a man (Adams) who\nwas sentenced to death for a crime he didn't commit.  Most of the book\nis the story of the long appeals process, and the problems and delays\ncaused by not being able to introduce new evidence in certain courts.
You said it worked so well with tobacco.  I was being fascisious(I can't spell \nworth a damn)\n\nLook, this is getting ridiculous, first, I think tobacco should be legal.  \nAnybody who can't see the difference between tobacco and marijuana has got to \nbe high.
>It is very difficult for a young person to develop and build\n    >a positive view of themself when they are constantly being\n    >told implicitly and explicitly that they are wrong and\n    >immoral.\n\nYes, that is most certainly true. However, the paragrapgh reflects a value-less\nposition and infers that what is more important than anything else is to\nhave "a positive view" of one's self.\n\nThis of course, is foolish.\n\nShould a mass murderer, a pedophile, a 10-year old pyromaniac have a "positive\nview" of themselves?\n\nOf course not.\n\nA person that engages in behaviour that a large number of people condemn,\nand IF you believe in the concept of "society", then your only choice is\nto expect that person to have a negative view of themselves.\n\n\n-- \nThere are actually people that STILL believe Love Canal was some kind of\nenvironmental disaster. Weird, eh?
That was hardly the point, was it? I was commenting on this all-too-common\nRepublican attitude that if people disagree with us, they must be idiots, they\nmust be sheep being led around by the Evil Liberal Media Conspiracy. This is\na dangerous attitude indeed. Because it's not a very big step from "people\nare sheep, they can't think for themselves" to "people are sheep and need\nfirm leadership from we, who know better"... this sort of attitude makes\nme worry about what'll happen to the United States if the extremist wing\nof the Republican party ever gets back into power again.\n\n\nHey! This is a government-funded newsgroup! Let's have some separation\nof church and state, damn it!\n\n\n\n\nMore like:\n\nBroward: "Clinton's going to raise your income taxes by over $1000!"\nMark:    "No, he's not, only about $204."\nBroward: (silence)\n\n\nOK, I predict that in 1996 the Republicans will STILL be bitter. Yeah, yeah,\nI know, it's not very impressive to predict things that are inevitable...
THE WHITE HOUSE\n\n                    Office of the Press Secretary\n_____________________________________________________________________\nFor Immediate Release                                  April 15, 1993\n\n\n                            PRESS BRIEFING\n                       BY GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS\n\n                          The Briefing Room\n\n\n\n1:04 P.M. EDT\n	     \n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Good afternoon.  \n	     \n	     Q	  Could we do this on the lawn?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That would be nice.  Let's go out \nto the cherry blossoms.  We'll do like the President.\n	     \n	     Q	  Is the stimulus package dead? \n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Absolutely not.  \n	     \n	     Q	  Can you tell us more about the Dole talks?  You \nsaid it was a good visit, but no compromise.\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.  The President had a good talk \nwith Senator Dole last night.  I think that as we said before, there \nwere no specific compromises on either side, although it was a very \ngood discussion about the jobs package and about other issues as \nwell.  As you know, the President first called Senator Dole I believe \nTuesday night to talk about the Russian aid package.  They did not \nspeak -- Senator Dole called him back Wednesday morning -- when the \nPresident was out.  Instead he spoke with Tony Lake, and at the close \nof that conversation, indicated that he wanted to speak to the \nPresident about the jobs and stimulus package.  They finally talked \nabout that yesterday afternoon.\n	     \n	     At the close of that discussion they said that they \nwould have another talk last night, which they did, when the Senator \nwas up in New Hampshire.  And although there were no specific \ncompromises made on either side, they did say that they would \ncontinue to have some discussions.  And that's where we are.\n	     \n	     Q	  Well, who is giving in?  Where is it standing --are \nboth making concessions?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know that it's at that \nphase.  No compromise has been made.  As the President has said \nconsistently, he intends to come forward with an adjusted package.  \nHe believes in the package, but he believes that if it's going to \ntake adjustments to get the minority to release it, he's willing to \nmake those adjustments.\n	     \n	     Q	  On the subject of a VAT --\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Oh, boy.\n	     \n	     Q	  Can we stay on this for one more minute?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Sure.\n	     \n	     Q	  We have a problem with the five minutes --\n	     \n	     Q	  I know no decisions have been made, but what would \nlead the health group to believe that a VAT might be necessary?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Sorry, Andrea, I'm not going to go \ndown that road.  No decisions have been made.  As the President said \nthis morning, a number of groups, a number of members of Congress, a \nnumber of other organizations have recommended that this be looked \nat.  The working group is looking at it, but no decisions have been \nmade.\n	     \n	     Q	  To follow, have they done that directly through \nhim?  Have labor and business groups been in touch with the President \nabout it?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not to my knowledge, although \nthere's a lot of people who have public decisions in support of the \nVAT.  But the President has not made a decision.\n	     \n	     Q	  At the meetings that he's had with his own task \nforce advisers, have they discussed the funding issue and what the \npossible options would be?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think that that has been \npresented for a decision, no.\n	     \n	     Q	  Not for a decision, but has it been discussed as an \noption?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, there are a lot of levels of \nbriefing.  I do not believe that the VAT has been presented to the \nPresident as, okay, this is something for you to decide on.  \n	     \n	     Q	  You're not saying he didn't know it was being \nconsidered, though, are you?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, he said it's being considered.\n	     \n	     Q	  He knew that.\n	     \n	     Q	  But has he discussed that with his advisers?  \nThat's what I'm asking.\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President has said it's being \nconsidered.  I do not know what level of discussion there has been \nover the VAT.  It is something the working groups are looking at.  I \ndon't even know that it's --\n	     \n	     Q	  But he didn't say he was considering, did he, at \nthis stage?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, he is not.  I think we're \ngetting into something of a metaphysical debate right here.  What is \nconsidered -- \n	     \n	     Q	  Well, he is the one who said, I haven't reviewed \nit.\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That is true.  That is what I just \nrepeated. \n	     \n	     Q	  George, is there any concern here that as a result \nof the definite statement he made in February and the promise that if \nit were to be considered he'd let us know, and having it trickle out \nthe way it did, that there may now be the development of a \ncredibility gap on this issue and others?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think so.  I mean, it is \nnow public knowledge that this is being considered.\n	     \n	     Q	  Is he or you at all embarrassed about the absolute \nstatements that were made from this platform to the effect that it \nwas off the table and was not being considered, and then to have it \ncome out not from you people, but --\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, wait a second.  It came out \nfrom the administration.  What are you talking about?\n	     \n	     Q	  What I'm saying is, though, that the President said \nhe would let us know. \n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Right.\n	     \n	     Q	  You people then said -- you said, I believe, that \nit's not going to be on the program.\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  On March 25th.\n	     \n	     Q	  On March 25th. \n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Circumstances change.\n	     \n	     Q	  Well, I understand.  But we have to find that out \nby rooting around in the fine print of an interview\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Rooting around -- I know you did do \na very good job there to read the USA Today article.  But this is --\n(laughter) -- the Deputy Director of the OMB and the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services.  I mean, that is common anytime you guys \nwrite a story that has an unattributed quote from somebody in the \nClinton administration, the headline is -- I'll look at it right \nhere, and AP story -- "Clinton wants more money for spying."\n	     \n	     Q	  What about his remark that if it were being \nconsidered, he'd tell us about it?  \n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  And the administration's concerned, \nand he'd let you know.\n	     \n	     Q	  And did he?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.  Absolutely.  What did he say \nthis morning?\n	     \n	     Q	  It had to be dragged out of you here yesterday.\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It didn't have to be dragged out of \nme.  We had the Deputy Director of the OMB, we had the Secretary of \nHealth of Human Services say it was being considered.  That is his \nadministration.  That is his administration policy.\n	     \n	     Q	  Were these authorized trial balloons, or were they \norchestrated leaks?  I mean, what was the --\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  They were asked questions, they \nanswered the questions.\n	     \n	     Q	  You're saying here that it didn't have to be \ndragged out, that you more or less made it clear yesterday you were \nconsidering it.\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Absolutely.  I was very clear.  \nPainfully clear.\n	     \n	     Q	  Was there a particular political strategy in making \nit clear the administration is considering a new tax increase on tax \nday?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, it was just this issue is being \nconsidered.  They were asked if it was being considered; they \nanswered that it was being considered.\n	     \n	     Q	  George, The New York Times --\n	     \n	     Q	  Why do it yesterday?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  They were asked.\n	     \n	     Q	  The New York Times reports today that Secretary \nReich and the chief economist at the Labor Department used apples and \noranges numbers in order to portray last month's unemployment figures \nin a way that was supportive of the President's job stimulus bill, \nbut which turned out to be totally false.\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know if it was totally \nfalse, but I think -- (laughter) -- the chief economist at the Labor \nDepartment did grant that it was an inappropriate mixing, and they \nsay that. \n	     \n	     Q	  The question is, is the President concerned about \nbehavior that amounts to corrupting government data?  And what's he \ndoing about it, if so?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The chief economist has said that a \nmistake was made, it won't happen again, and that's the end of the \nmatter.\n	     \n	     Q	  Isn't that the same information that goes to the \nPresident?\n	     \n	     Q	  If I could go back to the stimulus package --\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  There's two separate pieces of \ninformation.  I think that's where the confusion was.\n	     \n	     Q	  When did you all first learn about this mistake \nthat was made?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I read the article this morning.\n	     \n	     Q	  And as far as you know, is the President aware of \nit?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think so.\n	     \n	     Q	  And was he aware of it before he read about it in \nThe New York Times?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know.  Not to my knowledge.\n	     \n	     Q	  Did you ever hear about it before this morning?  \nAnything?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I didn't.\n	     \n	     Q	  Wasn't the President given an erroneous spin on \nthis for his own purpose?  For his speeches, for his arguments?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well again, I'm not sure.  Both \nstatements are true.  What the Labor Department has granted is that \nmixing them in one sentence, essentially, was misleading.  They said \nit was a mistake.  They said they wouldn't do it again.\n	     \n	     Q	  Did they drop it -- is this something that you \nchoose to spin or make an issue of?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Whenever fewer people are out of \nwork, we're gratified.  But that doesn't take away from the need to \nget this jobs package going.\n	     \n	     Q	  If I could go back to the stimulus package for a \nminute.  You said that the President plans to come forward with an \namendment.  Is the timetable still what it was -- that the amendment \nwould be laid down on Monday and voted on on Tuesday, or did he, in \nthe conversation with Dole, talk about the possibility of putting \nthat off for a few more days to give more time for the discussion?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think at this point there's no \nchanges in the schedule at all.  I don't know that they discussed the \ntiming like that.\n	     \n	     Q	  Do you believe that you're closer or getting closer \nthis week than you were last week?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I believe that we're going \nto pass a jobs package.  The President is prepared to make \nadjustments in order to get that to happen.  I don't know where the \nvotes are on cloture at this particular time.  I don't know what's \ngoing to happen until we have a vote.  But the President believes \ndeeply in this jobs package and wants to get it done.\n	     \n	     Q	  Has there been any indication that this situation \nhas changed?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We're going to continue to work on \nit.  We'll know when the votes are taken.\n	     \n	     Q	  George, last week you said that there are -- or \nvarious people in the administration were saying that you couldn't go \nthrough Dole, you were going to have to try and go around him because \nhe was immovable on this subject of a compromise, or at least the \ncompromise he wanted was not anything like the one that you could \naccept.  This week you're talking to him.  Is that because you've \nrealized that the peeling off effort wasn't going to work?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That's because Senator Dole wanted \nto talk to the President about the stimulus package.\n	     \n	     Q	  He initiated the conversation?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.\n	     \n	     Q	  Secretary Reich this morning said that, in fact, \nthe President is not willing to compromise on this bill at all.  You \nsay he's making --\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know that that's exactly \nwhat he said.  I think he said he didn't have any indication that \nthere was any compromises yet or that there would be a compromise, \nand the President doesn't want to compromise.  And the President \ndoesn't want to compromise.  But if he has to make adjustments to get \nit through, he will.\n	     \n	     Q	  Officials here yesterday said that Panetta was \nworking on a series of adjustments that might be made public before \nthe actual vote.\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's possible.\n	     \n	     Q	  Today?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm not sure exactly when that will \nhappen, but I think that it's very possible that we'll come forward \nwith some sort of a different package, or Senate Democrats will come \nforward with some sort of a different package in order to get it \npassed.\n	     \n	     Q	  As we understood his conversations with Dole, the \nfirst one was some discussion of this and I'll get back to you \ntonight with some details or some adjustments, or whatever the phrase \nis.  Did he offer him some details or some adjustments?  \n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think it's a question of how \ndetailed.  I mean, I think they had a general discussion about the \npackage last night, subsequent to their conversation yesterday \nafternoon.  I believe that there will be follow-up discussions today \nin the Senate, not necessarily between the President and Senator \nDole.  And let me just reiterate, neither side has made specific \ncompromises at this date.  When we have something we'll let you know.  \nAnd I'm not suggesting that Senator Dole has accepted anything that \nwe've talked about or that we've offered anything in a hard way.\n	     \n	     Q	  What are the follow-up discussions if not the \nPresident and Dole?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think Senator Mitchell is going \nto talk to Senator Dole.\n	     \n	     Q	  Is that a threat?  (Laughter.)\n	     \n	     Q	  Did the President say to Senator Dole, all right, \nhow about this number as an overall size, or did Dole say to the \nPresident, I can go as high as this?  Did they talk numbers?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think it was a negotiation \nin that respect.  It was more of a discussion about their positions.\n	     \n	     Q	  Did they discuss actual numbers?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm just not sure.  I know they \ntalked about the basic outlines of the packages.  I think they talked \nabout the programs they cared about.  I don't know if they got to the \nlevel of this many x-billion dollars. \n	     \n	     Q	  Does Dole have to sign off before there is a \npackage?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, of course not.\n	     \n	     Q	  Did the White House have anything to do with the \nprotesters who showed up in New Hampshire today where Senator Dole \nwas speaking?  Was that in any way organized by --\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not to my knowledge, no.\n	     \n	     Q	  And has the President been in touch with Senators \nKohl or Feingold?  \n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think he's talked to them, \nno.\n	     \n	     Q	  George, is the President considering the more \npalatable fact of having a national sales tax instead of having the \nhaves having to continuously pay for the have-nots?  And is he going \nto scrap his proposed tax on the privileged few, with the haves \nhaving to pay for the have-nots?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President believes deeply that \nthe tax rates on upper income Americans, as he presented in his \nbudget, should go up.  And I think for the second half of your \nquestion, I'll refer you to my briefing from yesterday.\n	     \n	     Q	  George, on the subject of accuracy in information, \nyou suggested the other day that the stimulus package included money \nthat would solve the water problem in Milwaukee.  Apparently that is \nnot true.  It's actually waste water money.\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's waste water money for \nWisconsin, and some could go to Milwaukee. \n	     \n	     Q	  But it would not affect the drinking water problem \nbecause it's waste water money, right?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It would affect the water treatment \noverall. \n	     \n	     Q	  But the implication from your statement the other \nday was that it would help fix this disease problem in Milwaukee now.  \nWould you agree that's not the case?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm not sure of the specifics.  I \nknow that it goes to the overall water treatment in Wisconsin.\n	     \n	     Q	  A leftover question from this morning, which was, \nwhen did the President find out that the task force was deliberating \non a VAT?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm not sure exactly when.  I just \ndon't know.  I assume it came up over the last -- certainly between \nthe time that we had commented on in the past and two days ago.  \n	     \n	     Q	  So sometime since March 25th?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think that's right.  I don't know \nthe exact date.\n	     \n	     Q	  George, the President this morning mentioned that \nsome labor and business groups are for the VAT tax.  Apparently, the \nNational Association of Manufacturers talks about perhaps the VAT tax \nbeing okay if it replaces the BTU tax.  So does the President feel \nthat perhaps this might be in place of some other tax he's proposed, \nor is this totally in addition to the other taxes he's already \nproposed?  \n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think we've said all we have to \nsay about the VAT at this point.  I mean, there's just no -- this is \nbeing considered by the health care working groups, and that is all.  \nThe President hasn't made any further decisions beyond that. \n	     \n	     Q	  But it would be to finance health care, it wouldn't \nbe to replace some other tax that finances -- it wouldn't replace the \nincome tax, for instance?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  There have been no discussions on \nthat.\n	     \n	     Q	  In terms of getting a VAT tax through Congress, \nSenator Dole's press release today said VAT -- on tax day.  Do you \nthink -- does it have a chance of getting through Congress?  Would it \nhave a chance?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I have no idea. \n	     \n	     Q	  Is that a consideration whether you all put it \nforward?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That would become a consideration \nif the President were to decide to do it.  It's not in consideration \nnow.\n	     \n	     Q	  You said at the beginning of the briefing that \ncircumstances had changed and that had caused the VAT to now be under \nconsideration.\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes, what the President referred to \nthis morning.  These groups came forward and said this is something \nthat has to be considered.\n	     \n	     Q	  Those are the circumstances that have changed?  \nThat's the only difference between now and when he emphatically ruled \nit out that groups have asked it to be considered?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That's what he said. \n	     \n	     Q	  Is that true?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.\n	     \n	     Q	  Was there, in fact, some understanding that sin \ntaxes would not produce enough money for the health care benefits?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm not going to get into the \ndeliberations.\n	     \n	     Q	  But, George --\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No.  What the consideration is, as \nthe President said, groups came forward and said this is something \nyou ought to consider.  The working groups are looking at it. \n	     \n	     Q	  Is that the only thing that's changed since his \nprior statement and your prior statement on the VAT?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.\n	     \n	     Q	  Can you explain how those groups -- how that \ninformation got to him that groups wanted it?  Was it just reading \nthe newspaper or did groups make presentations?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think the groups -- as you know, \nthe health care task force has met with dozens of groups.\n	     \n	     Q	  But this is the President's knowledge that these \ngroups had come forward.\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think he was referring to what \nwas coming to the working groups.  Obviously, there have also been \npublished positions in the newspapers.\n	     \n	     Q	  Have certain groups briefed him on the group's \npresentations to them?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know if they've briefed him \n-- I mean, how detailed the briefings have been.    I know that the \nworking groups decided to look into this after being pressed by these \ngroups.\n	     \n	     Q	  What kind of arguments did the groups make that \nwere persuasive enough that the President would change the position \nthat he had enunciated previously?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know, it's just they've had \nlongstanding positions that this would be a good way to finance \nhealth care.\n	     \n	     Q	  The President wasn't aware of those longstanding \npositions?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He may have been at some level.  \nObviously, he's been a governor for a long time and he knows the \nbasic arguments for and against a VAT tax.\n	     \n	     Q	  What we're trying to figure out here -- you're \ntelling us that the only change, the only thing that affected this \nchange in the President's attitude toward the VAT between February \nand now --\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President's attitude hasn't \nnecessarily changed.  I mean, he has not made a decision.\n	     \n	     Q	  I know, but the President said that it was off the \ntable.  So did you.  And you're saying that the only thing that's \nchanged is the positions of these groups, except you're also \ndescribing them as longstanding positions.  I don't see the change.  \nIf these groups haven't had any change in their position that's been \nmade to the President --\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, they've made the \npresentations to the health care task force.\n	     \n	     Q	  There's no relationship at all between the fact \nthat sin taxes that he had said -- suggested in February that he \nfavored will not produce enough revenue to finance --\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think he ever suggested \nthat they would produce all the revenue.\n	     \n	     Q	  Well, he suggested that he thought that those were \nappropriate ways to finance health care.\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He did say that.  I don't know that \nhe said anything to refute that.\n	     \n	     Q	  But, in fact, has the task force discovered that \nthere wouldn't be enough revenue from those taxes to finance the kind \nof core benefits --\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I don't think that the task \nforce ever suggested that there would.\n	     \n	     Q	  George, if he advocated a VAT tax, would that break \nhis promise not to raise taxes on the middle class to pay for his \nprograms?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I can't comment on a hypothetical \nsituation.\n	     	  \n	     Q	  But does that promise -- would that promise not to \nraise taxes on the middle class to pay for the programs prevent him \nfrom seeking a VAT tax?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President has made no decisions \non the VAT tax.  When he does, we'll tell you and we'll explain the \nimplications then.\n	     \n	     Q	  Which specific groups can you cite -- business, \nlabor or otherwise -- whose recommendations to the health care task \nforce has prompted this consideration?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't have the specific.  I just \ndon't have that.\n	     \n	     Q	  George, can you tell us to what extend these other \nalternatives, for instance, the employer tax or the sin taxes or \nother financing options are also still on the table and what these \noptions are?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, as members of the task force \nand representatives of the working groups have said, they are looking \nat a wide variety of options.  I think that Ira Magaziner said that \nthere are 20 different options under consideration.  But I'm not \ngoing to comment --\n	     \n	     Q	  What's the scope --\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm just not going to comment on \nthem, no.\n	     \n	     Q	  What's the scope of the need?  How much are you \ntalking about that has to be produced by one or a combination of the \n--\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That's what the health care task \nforce is looking at.\n	     \n	     Q	  Since there's not going to be any briefing on the \nMiyazawa visit, two questions:  One, generally what does the \nPresident hope to use that meeting for, but more specifically, is his \ntask complicated by the Japanese anger over the Vancouver note and \nthe remark about market access at the press conference?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The Vancouver note?\n	     \n	     Q	  Does no mean yes.\n	     \n	     Q	  Yes and no.\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I don't know.  I saw the \nPrime Minister's press conference where he was asked the question \nabout that note and he gave a very gracious and complete answer when \nhe was asked the question.  The questions of trade are something that \ncertainly will be discussed between the Prime Minister and the \nPresident.  There is obviously a trade imbalance between Japan and \nthe U.S. that we want to do something about.\n	     \n	     Q	  Also in those comments the Prime Minister made he \nsuggested that the United States should come down heavy on him in \nterms of trade.  Are you going to oblige?  \n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:   I think the President will state \nour views on trade very clearly and our views on the trade deficit \nvery clearly.  I don't necessarily want to agree with your \ncharacterization of the Prime Minister's comments.\n	     \n	     Q	     that we need specific export targets, specific \nnumerical targets -- is that what he's going to discuss with \nMiyazawa?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  They're going to have a broad \ndiscussion of a wide range of trade issues.  I don't want to get into \nthose specifics until after the meeting.\n	     \n	     Q	  Why?\n	     \n	     Q	   That's the crux of the issue, right?  Whether or \nnot -- does the President believe that without specific numerical \ntargets, it is really, as he said in his press conference, sort of \nhopeless that this is going to change very much?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President believes that we must \nhave pressure on Japan to turn the trade imbalance around.  I do not \nwant to get into the specifics of how that would be done.\n	     \n	     Q	  But does the President believe that their stimulus \npackage announced yesterday will rectify the imbalance?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think, first, the President wants \nto get a full briefing on the stimulus package from Prime Minister \nMiyazawa himself, and then he'll make the comment on it.\n	     \n	     Q	  How about the Russian aid package?  There seems to \nbe some confusion about how the U.S. views that, Secretary \nChristopher saying -- or Bentsen saying the Japanese may need to do \nmore, the Japanese saying that that's not what they heard?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, we're going to continue to \nwork with all our allies in the G-7, and we're going to continue to \npress for help for Russian reform, Russian democratic reform.  And I \nthink that, so far, we had a very good announcement out of Tokyo and \nwe're going to continue to work with our allies for bilateral \npackages.\n	     \n	     Q	  Do you think the Japanese need to do more?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We're going to continue to work \nwith all our allies to do as much as we can.\n	     \n	     Q	  Secretary Christopher was asked today on the Today \nShow this morning what he thought of Margaret Thatcher's comments on \nthe Bosnia policy.  And he said, "It's a rather emotional response."  \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Over an emotional issue.\n	     \n	     Q	  Right -- to an emotional problem.  Does the White  \nHouse condone that kind of remark?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think that Secretary \nChristopher's remarks speaks for itself.  The President believes also \nthat this is a deeply troubling situation that we're trying to find \nanswers for. \n	     \n	     Q	  But that specific -- "rather emotional response" -- \nspecific term?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, it speaks for itself.\n	     \n	     Q	  In connection with that, doesn't it seem that with \nthe numbers of people who are being killed at this very moment, is it \ngood American policy to put off some decisions that might be made now \nto help Boris Yeltsin win a referendum?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  For example?\n	     \n	     Q	  To take stronger action, to take military action -- \nair strikes, anything that can be done?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President believes that what \nmust be done now is to push harder for sanctions.  He is also -- as \nyou know, the administration has been discussing lifting the arms \nembargo.  He believes those are the appropriate ways to increase \npressure at this time.\n	     \n	     Q	  What is your response to the critics who would say \nthat the U.S. is now stymied by trying to help Boris Yeltsin retain \nthe presidency?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  They're wrong.  We're pressing hard \nfor the Serbs to come to the negotiating table.  We're pressing hard \nfor increased sanctions, and we're talking to our allies about the \narms embargo.\n	     \n	     Q	  You were putting great store in Vance and Owen \ngetting people to agree to that.  Now, Vance and Owen have both said \nthat military force to some extent would be acceptable.  Does that \nchange your thinking?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Clearly, we're going to listen to \nwhatever people who have put so much time into a situation have to \nsay.  But at this point, the President is moving forward on sanctions \nand talking about the arms embargo.\n	     \n	     Q	  A follow-up on a Dee Dee comment this morning.  She \nsaid she would be able to provide some administration officials who \ncould document the effect the sanctions are having in Bosnia.  Are \nyou going to be able to do that, or do you have anything --\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think that's what she said.\n	     \n	     Q	  That's exactly what she said.\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think that's true.  But \nwhat she said -- we would look into the situation of what kind of \nevidence can be provided in Bosnia.  Obviously, if there are \nconnections between the Bosnian Serbs and the Serbs in Belgrade and \nwe are tightening the screws on the Serbs in Belgrade, that will have \nan effect over time.  I do not know day by day, minute by minute, \nwhat kind of help is being given between the two and what the exact \neffect has been.   But, clearly, we are slowing the shipment of goods \ninto Belgrade.  We are having an effect on the Serbs there.  What \nkind of effect that will eventually have on the Bosnian Serbs I don't \nknow.  But one thing I would say is if it were having no effect at \nall, I don't know why they'd be fighting it so much.\n	     \n	     Q	  Are the First Lady's tax returns going to be \nreleased?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think there's a joint tax return.  \nAnd it will be probably later today.\n	     \n	     Q	  Is the President considering signing an executive \norder banning discrimination against homosexuals in the federal work \nforce as part of the gay rights march here next week?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think there's any proposal \nfor that at this time, not that I know of.\n	     \n	     Q	  It's something that the President promised during \nthe campaign that he would do.\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I have not seen any -- I don't \nthink it's anything that's on his plate right now.\n	     \n	     Q	  Is he meeting with gay rights leaders at any point \non this issue?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know about on this issue.  \nI assume that he'll meet with representatives of the gay and lesbian \ncommunity sometime soon, as he meets with representatives of lots of \ndifferent groups and communities.\n	     \n	     Q	  Do you know if that's scheduled --\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's probably going to be tomorrow.\n	     \n	     Q	  Probably going to be tomorrow?  (Laughter.)\n	     \n	     Q	  It's a good thing you asked.\n	     \n	     Q	  Who's probably going to be there?  (Laughter.)\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know.\n	     \n	     Q	  How long --\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know.  That's all I know.\n	     \n	     Q	  Do you know if it's at 3:00 p.m. tomorrow?  \n(Laughter.)\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know what time it is.  I \ndon't even know for sure if it's going to be tomorrow.\n	     \n	     Q	  Environmental groups have asked him to make a major \nspeech next week of some kind.  Is that going to happen, do you know?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know if they've asked, but \nI think the President has always planned, as he did last year, to \ngive a speech on Earth Day and I expect that he will.  If it's not \nexactly on Earth Day, it might be a day before or something like \nthat.\n	     \n	     Q	  Is he planning to sign or announce the signing of \nthe biodiversity treaty in connection with Earth Day?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I don't know the specific \ntiming of something like that, but it's certainly something under \ndiscussion and something we've been working on.\n	     \n	     Q	  Campaign finance reform?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We're working on it.\n	     \n	     Q	  Do you think it will be next week?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm just not sure.\n	     \n	     Q	  The biodiversity treaty is something you're working \non?  I missed the question.\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes, something we're working on.  \nHe asked if it was ready to be signed, and I said I didn't know \nanything about that but it's something we've certainly been working \non.\n	     \n	     Q	  Do you know what organizations might be represented \nin this meeting with the gay and lesbian groups?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't.\n	     \n	     Q	  Do you know if he is going to reconsider being out \nof town on the day of the march?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He's got to be at the Senate \nmeeting in Jamestown, and I believe he's also going to be giving a \nspeech to the American Association of Newspaper Publishers in Boston \non Sunday, as he did last year.\n	     \n	     Q	  Would you have told us if she had not pressed you \non the question?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  On what?\n	     \n	     Q	  On the gays.\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  When we went through the \nPresident's schedule for the day, certainly.\n	     \n	     Q?	    George, what day is the publisher's speech?  Is \nthat Sunday?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think it's a Sunday.\n	     \n	     Q	  And Saturday he'll be in Jamestown?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.\n	     \n	     Q	  So you're just going to be in Jamestown for one \nday?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, I'm not sure.  I don't know how \nlong the Senate thing goes.  It might go overnight.  I just don't \nknow.\n	     \n	     Q	  You would have made the gay meeting public, right?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm certain if we had the meeting \n-- I don't know about open to the press, but we would have told you \nabout it.\n	     \n	     Q	  I mean, because it is, as far as I can tell, the \nfirst time in history a President has met in the Oval Office with --  \n\n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I didn't say it was going to be in \nthe Oval Office.  (Laughter.)  But I didn't -- I'm not say that it's \nnot, but I didn't say that it was.  (Laughter.)\n	     \n	     Q	     at the White House in the Bush administration \ngay officials were invited to a bill signing ceremony and the White \nHouse had to repudiate having done that.  So I just wanted to make \nsure --\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the President wouldn't do \nanything like that.\n	     \n	     Q	  Certainly not.\n	     \n	     Q	  What marching orders did the President give to \nGeneral Vessey?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  They had a very good discussion for \nabout half an hour today.  He wanted -- the most important thing was \nhe had a full accounting for American POWs and MIAs.  He will \nobviously look into the circumstances surrounding this new document.  \nThe President stressed that he wanted the fullest possible accounting \nand said that only when we have that can we even consider any changes \nin our policy towards Vietnam.  He'll be looking at Vietnam's \nresponse to the questions raised by the document and he'll also look \ninto investigations on discrepancy cases, increased efforts on \nremains, implementing trilateral investigations -- and access to \nmilitary archives.  \n	     \n	     And Ambassador Toon also briefed the President on the \nactivities of the joint commission and on the document.\n	     \n	     Q	  Vietnam says it's a fake.  What is the DOD analysis \nat this stage?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's not completed yet, and it's \nalso the first thing that General Vessey will bring up with the \nVietnamese.\n	     \n	     Q	  A number of Defense officials have been saying that \nthey think that the 600 or so prisoners referred to are, in fact, \nnon-Americans that the Vietnamese had captured who they referred to \nas Americans from time to time.  Do people -- \n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We don't have any final \ndetermination.  We're going to wait for the complete review; when we \nhave it, we'll make a judgment.\n	     \n	     Q	  I know you don't have any final determination, but \ngiven all of the intense public interest in this, do you think that \nthat's a likely possibility?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I just don't want to characterize \nit in any way until the review is complete.\n	     \n	     Q	  George, was there a topic scheduled for the speech \nin Boston?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No. \n	     \n	     Q	  Is the President going to have a press conference \ntomorrow with Miyazawa?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think so, but I'm not positive.  \nYes, I expect, yes.\n	     \n	     Q	  Was Toon in with Vessey?  \n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes. \n	     \n	     Q	  He was in on the meeting?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.\n	     \n	     Q	  What was the question?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Was Ambassador Toon in with Vessey, \nand the answer is yes. \n	     \n	     Q	  Do you have any response to The Wall Street Journal \nreport this morning the President's distressed about some of his \npress clippings and that perhaps he's distressed with you about that?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No.  Well, I do have a response.  I \nthink the article was highly misleading to the extent that it implied \nthat the President has had restricted access to the press.  I would \npoint out that he's answered 358 questions on 77 occasions, more than \nany of his predecessors. I would also point out it also --\n	     \n	     Q	  How many questions?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Three hundred fifty-eight, on 77 \noccasions.\n	     \n	     Q	  How many were while he was jogging?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, no, that's actually a very \ngood question, Andrea.  And I would point out further that the \narticle also implied that these questions were only answered at \ntightly controlled photo opportunities, which is just patently false.  \nHe's had 13 press conferences in either the East Room, the Oval \nOffice or the Roosevelt Room or the Briefing Room, in addition to \nquestions taken at photo opportunities, and that is only the --\n	     \n	     Q	  Oval Office press conference -- when was that? \n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He's answered questions in the --\nEast Room.  He's had five in the East Room, he's had one in the Oval \nOffice, he's had one in the Rose Garden, he's had one or two in the \nRoosevelt Room.  And this is just to the White House, Washington \nPress Corps.  In addition to that, he's had 17 interviews with local \ntelevision anchors.  He's met with the editorial board of The \nPortland Oregonian.  He's had an hour-long interview with Dan Rather. \nHe's had interviews with local press from California, Florida and \nConnecticut --\n	     \n	     Q	  Can you address the question of the attitude?  The \narticle implies that he doesn't --\n	     \n	     Q	  Why doesn't he like us?  (Laughter.)\n	     \n	     Q	  Did you really get blamed for that Post story?\n	     \n	     Q	  The story is that you -- are you held responsible \nfor it.\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think I'm going to comment \nabout this.\n	     \n	     Q	  Are you denying that the President has shown \ndispleasure publicly?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I am not commenting on the \ndiscussions between the President and myself.\n	     \n	     Q	  Did the President write that letter to Chris \nWebber?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  What?\n	     \n	     Q	  The letter to the University of Michigan basketball \nplayer?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Oh, yes.\n	     \n	     Q	  That is an authentic letter?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.\n	     \n	     Q	  Since the President first talked about the VAT in \nFebruary, he said at the time that he thought there probably should \nbe exceptions made in basic necessities such as food and clothing.  \nDoes he still hold that position given the impact it could have?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I just can't comment on a \nproposal he hasn't made.\n	     \n	     Q	  George, does the President have some agenda for \nthis meeting with the gay leaders tomorrow?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I think it will just a \ngeneral meeting on the wide range of issues that they care about \nincluding AIDS and other issues -- civil rights.\n	     \n	     Q	  The military issue?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm certain it will come up.\n	     \n	     Q	  Is he using this event to name the AIDS --\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think so.\n	     \n	     Q	  George, what specifically is the President doing to \nprepare for tomorrow's meeting with the Prime Minister Miyazawa?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He's had briefing memos.  He's had \ngeneral discussions with members of the Treasury Department, the \nTrade Representative and others.\n	     \n	     Q	     report yet?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know if he has the report \nreferred to in The Times, but Ambassador Kantor was here to brief him \ntoday.\n	     \n	     Q	  He was?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.\n	     \n	     Q	  Does he intend to use any of these instances that \n--\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I don't know that the \nreport's been presented.  But obviously, the President will press \nhard in any case where he thinks that a violation has occurred.\n	     \n	     Q	  In terms of the Wall Street Journal, the thrust was \nthat there's a real schism here -- a hostility.  Do you think he \nfeels that way?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not at all.  As I said on the \nrecord in the article, I think the President likes reporters.  Again, \nI think that the thrust of the article was still misleading.  The \nthrust of the article was that in some way, some attitude which the \nPresident may or may not have is affecting access when, in fact, he \nhas the most open, accessible administration than have any in recent \nhistory.\n\n	     Q	  Can we come up to your office?  (Laughter.)\n\n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  If you're invited.  \n	     \n	     THE PRESS:  Thank you.\n\n                                 END                    1:34 P.M. EDT
Would you please define "nth derivative of debt"?  Last time I asked\nyou seem to have disappeared....\n\n	And it's the deficits themselves that came down to 2.9% of GNP.  The\nnumbers are posted in the previous posting.\n\n\n	Cute, Paul, but with no numbers you still look foolish.\n\n\n	Paul, like many others, is confusing the deficit with the debt.\n\n\n	Not in terms of GNP, the one universally accepted measure of deficits\n(at least among rigorous economists :)\n\n...\n\n	Semantics.  Lindsey proves otherwise.  Taxes make people change their\neconomic activities.\n	Or shall we debate whether it is the gun, the bullet, or the person who\ndoes the killing?\n\n\n	Or whether this gentleman can win the same praise as Lindsey. :)
Once again, Mark, you don't specify the means through which the government\nis to be prevented from becoming the tool of business interests.  As a \nleft-wing, big government, conventional liberal, I'm just as willing as\nyou are to vote against anti-competitive regulations that favor auto\ndealers.  \n\nBut what I hear from libertarians is a desire to limit incumbents' terms,\nto weaken government by eliminating its power to enforce antitrust laws,\nand a desire to eliminate legislator's pay.  Each strikes me as a \nparticularly ineffective way to insure that auto dealers and other special\ninterests cannot influence public policy.  In fact, they seem clearly\ndesigned to accomplish the opposite.\n\njsh

Which points to an anti-bias-against wrt\nblacks.\n\nIn any case, for violent crimes and burglary and drug selling, blacks are\nreported 53%, arrested 44%, and are present in jails/prisons 47% (1988).\n\nConsidering that 12% of the population is black, 6% are black males, and\nsome percentage of that is out of the high/low age groups, we do have a\nsituation where (if I remember my old calculations right) 4% of the\npopulation commits almost half of the really nasty crimes.\n\nBlacks with similar histories (crime) to whites get the same sentences,\nexcept in the South, where they receive around 20% less on paper!!\n\n\n\n-- \nThere are actually people that STILL believe Love Canal was some kind of\nenvironmental disaster.

THE WHITE HOUSE\n\n                    Office of the Press Secretary\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nFor Immediate Release                                  April 5, 1993 \n\n                       REMARKS BY THE PRESIDENT\n        EN ROUTE TO CAMDEN YARDS FOR ORIOLES OPENING DAY GAME\n	     \n                              MARC Train\n                       En Route to Camden Yards\n\n\n\n11:45 A.M. EDT\n	     \n	     Q	  Mr. President, what do you think of Jesse Jackson's \nprotest today?\n	     \n	     THE PRESIDENT:  I think it's an informational protest.  \nI think it's fine.  The owners put out a statement few days ago, \nwhich they say was the first step in, you know, efforts to increase \nminority ownership and minority increases in management.  I think we \nshould.  I'm encouraged by Don Baylor's appointment out in Colorado.  \nAnd I think it's time to make a move on that front.  So, I think it's \na legitimate issue, and I think it's -- like I said, it's an \ninformational picket and not an attempt to get people not to go to \nthe game.  So, I think it's good.\n	     \n	     Q	  Do you think they're moving fast enough?\n	     \n	     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I think that it was a good first \nstep.  And I think you'll see some movement now.  And I think it's an \nissue that deserves some attention, and they're obviously going to \ngive it some.  And I think that Reverend Jackson being out there will \nhighlight the issue.  So I think it's fine.\n	     \n	     Q	  Mr. President, how about the logjam in the Senate \non the economic stimulus plan?  Do you think they'll be able to break \nthat and get cloture?\n	     \n	     THE PRESIDENT:  I don't know, we're working at it.  I \nmean, it's a classic -- there was an article in the paper today, one \nof the papers I saw, which pretty well summed it up.  They said, you \nknow, this is a -- it's just a political power play.  In the Senate \nthe majority does not rule.  It's not like the country.  It's not \nlike the -- it's not like the House.  If the minority chooses, they \ncan stop majority rule.  And that's what they're doing.  There are a \nlot of Republican senators who have told people that they might vote \nfor the stimulus program but there's enormous partisan political \npressure not to do it.  \n	     \n	     And, of course, what it means is that in this time when \nno new jobs are being created, even though there seems to be an \neconomic recovery, it means that for political purposes they're \nwilling to deny jobs to places like Baltimore and Dallas and Houston \nand Pittsburgh and Philadelphia and Portland and Seattle.  It's very \nsad.  I mean, the block grant program was designed to create jobs in \na hurry based on local priorities, and it's one that the Republicans \nhad always championed.  Just about the only Democrat champions of the \nprogram were people like me who were out there at the grassroots \nlevel, governors and senators.  I just think it's real sad that they \nhave chosen to exert the minority muscle in a way that will keep \nAmericans out of work.  I think it's a mistake.\n	     \n	     THE PRESS:  Thank you.
It is a bit unfair to call blame the Clinton Administration alone...this\ninitiative was underway under the Bush Administration...it is basically\na bipartisan effort of the establishment Demopublicans and\nRepublicrats...the same bipartisan effort that brought the S&L scandal,\nand BCCI, etc.
I've read about more than a few of these programs that ran into\nproblems in convincing parents to get their children immunized even\nwhen they were delivered to their doorstep.

If a six year old child does a funny trick and you say well done he will\ndo it again and it may be funny. Then they may repeat it over and over\nagain bu you still have to pretend its funny even though it isn't any\nmore. Once they are older than six you expect them to realise that doing\nthe same thing over and over again isn't funny any more.\n\nBasicaly Ed fails to be amusing because he is merely crass. He does not\nmake jokes that have any political content beyond attempting to ridicule\ntheir target. Calling someone Slick Willie is not funny even if you put\non a red nose while you say it, it was a good debating point used on the\nspur of the moment 12 months ago but now its use merely demonstrates that the\nuser couldn't think of anything original to say.\n\n\nIn the UK there is a tradition of old retired Colnels who bore the dinner\nguests rigid with their descriptions of old campagns. Ed is clearly one\nof this type of people who fails to see when a joke is spent.

I have to agree with you... the police may have carried it a bit too far\nbut Rodney King was no angel either. And I don't think ANY guilty\nverdicts should have been returned. I'm sure you know why they handed\ndown guilty verdicts on two of the officers. It's quite simple really,\nit was a compromise to avoid rioting in the places where minorities\nthink it's right to riot. I hate to say this, but I would have liked to\nsee them riot with everyone prepared. It would be open season if your\nskin was even slightly brown.\n\nHey, my motto is, you don't fuck with me or my stuff and you don't get\nkilled.

Agreed.  \n\n\nIt is a failure of libertarianism if the ideology does not provide any\nreasonable way to restrain such actions other than utopian dreams.  Just\nas Marxism "fails" to specify how pure communism is to be achieved and\nthe state is to "wither away," libertarians frequently fail to show how\nweakening the power of the state will result in improvement in the human\ncondition.\n\n\nThis is a strawman argument and fails on several grounds.  In this case,\n"limited" and "big" government are not defined.  I would point out that\nLebanon, Somalia, and the former Yugoslavia are by some definitions nations\nwith "limited" government, while the US, Canada, and nations in Western \nEurope (where "people would rather live") are often pointed out as \nnations with "big government" from a libertarian point of view.  \n\nThe argument is not between those who want "limited" government and those\nwho want "unlimited" government.  It is between those who believe\ngovernment regulation in a capitalist economy serves worthwhile ends and\nthose who believe such regulation is neither desirable on empirical \ngrounds nor justifiable on ideological grounds.\n\njsh
---\n51 Arrested for Defying Judge's Order at Abortion Protest Rally\nThe Miami Herald, April 11, 1993\n\n   Melbourne, Florida --   [...]\n\n   Circuit Judge Robert McGregor's order prohibits anti-abortion pickets\n   within 36 feet of the property line of Aware Woman Center for Choice.\n   Even across the street, they may not display pictures of dead fetuses\n   or sing or chant loud enough to be heard by patients inside the clinic.\n\n   The protesters say the ruling all but wiped out the First Amendment\n   to the Constitution.\n\n   ``This is our sidewalk,'' said Joe Carroll, 33, a landscaper who\n   marched with his children, Mary Grace, 8, and John, 7.\n\n   ``I am not a rescuer.  I am not a trespasser.  It's just that this is\n   my sidewalk.  I am not really protesting abortion.  We are protesting\n   denial of our rights of assembly, religion, speech.  This judge is\n   trashing the Constitution.''\n\n   The children's grandmother led them away, sobbing, as Carroll and\n   his father were arrested.\n\n   Outside the clinic, Eleanor Smeal, president of the Washington,\n   D.C.-based Feminist Majority Foundation, called for the Florida\n   Legislature and Congress to pass laws as tough as the judge's\n   order, which covers only Brevard and Seminole counties.\n\n   ``This cannot go on,'' she said.  ``This is not freedom of speech,\n   this is total psychological warfare with violence.

Perhaps 1%, but most likely not more than 2%.  A new study\n(discrediting Kinsey) says so.
Judging from past experience (the '87 March, a Peace and Justice March the \nsame year, and 3 different Pro-coice Marches), The Park Service will come out\nwith an estimate that is approximately 1/2 the estimate that organizers will\ncome up with - though the last Choice march I went to had a sign-in system, \nand the numbers ended up closer.  And then you've got the media types in their\nhelicopters, rolling dice.\n\nI believe the MOW plans and handing out some sort of wristband thingy, and \nbasing their count on those.

I would doubt any civil rights case would be in order for the point that you\nmentioned.  Even if it were possible, I think it is a bad idea since it smacks\nreal strongly of double jeopardy.  A civil case for damages is fine since that\nis a trial that would proceed regardless of the first.  I think a bad precedent\nhas already been set in the King trial in L.A. and something like this would\nmake it worse.  Regardless of how bad anybody feels about this decision, it\nmust stand that charges of assault were not not proven against the three\nmarines and that's how it should stand.\n\nFrank (who is still mad, but now somewhat sane)\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFrank R.

Yes, very serious.  I claim that I can substantiate my statement that\nRudman says he doesn't believe Perot was investigating him.  You claim\nPerot was investigating him.

OK Phil, you're right. So far the "evidence" suggests that Nixon was a victim\nof overzealous underlings and Kennedy was a womanizing disgust-o-blob with\na dash of megalomania. After crushing the CIA and FBI who's to say Kennedy \nwouldn't have created his own version of American Friendly Fascism?\n\nUnfortunately however, we don't have all the evidence. So far this nation's\ncitizens have been privy to about 12 hours of the total 4,000 hours of Nixon's\ntapes. What's on the rest of those babies? Some archivists have alluded that\nthere is "evidence" to suggest that Nixon and his cronies, including George\nBush, were aware of the plot to murder Kennedy before he was shot in Dallas.\n\nAsk your local D.A. what the charges are for the above crime.\n\n\nAnd so I must ask you, Phil me putz, when all this shit finally comes out\nwhen you and I are old men, I would appreciate the privilege of sticking a pole\nup your ass and parading you down Main Street with a sign on your chest:\n\n"I was an Apologist for the American Fascist Regime circa 1944 -- 2010"\n\n(How's that for a lovely Brecht-ian image:-)\n\n\nThere, that ought to get a reaction.

Yo--earth to Clayton--*my* philosophy?  I have never discussed this with you.\nI know it's a minor point, but, gee, dude, you have no idea what economic\nand political principles I adhere to.

At what point does the\nperpetrator become completely innocent altogether?  You know, this lends\na whole new meaning to the term "the moral high ground".\n\n\n\n\nI will pass the info on.

This statement is just so blatantly disgusting and free of any implicit\nneural activity that I will almost completely ignore it.\n\n\n\n\nSigh.

Some survey conducted by the U.S. government and some group (I don't know \nwhich) did what they were calling on all the news shows this morning, "The most\ncomprehensive survey of sexuality in the past 50 years".

The Selective Service Registration should be abolished.  To start with, the\ndraft is immoral.

Finally, the government has us\non many lists in many computers (the IRS, Social Security Admistration and\nMotor Vehicle Registries to name a few) and it can find us if it needs to.\nMaintaining yet another list of people is an utter waste of money and time.\nLet's axe this whole department, and reduce the deficit a little bit.
In <1993Apr15.143320.8618@desire.wright.edu>, demon@desire.wright.edu sez:\n\nThere's this minor thing called "interest of finality/repose".  What\nit means is that parties aren't dragged into court over and over again\nbecause the losing side "discovers" some "new" evidence.  I don't know\nabout you, Brett, but I suspect GM had the resources to find just\nabout as many expert and fact witnesses as it wanted before the trial\nstarted.  Letting them re-open the case now is practically an\ninvitation to every civil litigant on earth to keep an ace in the hole\nin case the verdict goes against him.\n\nBTW, in federal criminal cases, Rule 33 does permit a motion for a new\ntrial "based on . . . *newly discovered* evidence" if made within 2\nyears of the verdict.  (Emphasis mine.)  If you're trying to make a\nbackhanded point about criminal justice in a discussion that has\nlittle to do with criminal trials -- as the estimable David Brock did\nin his amusing WSJ piece last week -- save your breath.\n\n\n\n\nYup.  Which is why they shoulda been brought around the first time\nthrough. \n\n\n\nUnless there's some reason to believe that this supposed bias predated\nthe trial (as opposed to being a product of it), and that GM was\nunfairly prevented from discovering it (by venireman concealment or\notherwise), why should GM be allowed to complain?
And not only that, but if the drugs were legal we could have pharmacists instead\nof pushers selling them, and the pharmacists could be obligated to not only\ninform the purchasers of the dangers of drug use, but also show them how to use\nthe drugs in relatively safe ways.  And the dangers of impurities (responsible\nfor much of the suffering that drugs cause) would be all but eliminated.
Nice dodge. I give it a 9.2.\n\nNow to answer your questions. I do not believe that there should be a\ndraft. The armed services should be voluntary. Can you say the same\nabout taxes.\n\nI've answered your question. Would you now answer mine.

It is also widely stated (in non-mainstream sources) that the CIA had a\nlarge part in the overthrow of the popular (and popularly-elected)\nleft-leaning Premier Mossadegh in 1953.

And who's advocating that?  Hate crimes laws are aimed at the motivations\nof the acts.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThen why do we really need national health insurance then? Wouldn't it just make\nmore sense to find some way to cut down on the cost of malpractice insurance?\n\nAnd maybe that's not such a good thing. I also read somewhere that it is next to\nimpossible in Canada to litigate against the health system-class action suits\nare nearly impossible, and you can't sue the provincial health officials at all.\n\n\nOh no. Don't let the AMA know about this. They have enough power as it is. Ask\nmost Americans whether they'd like the doctors' lobby to get more powerful.\n\n\nWell, yeah, tell us about the National Defense Medical Centre outside Ottawa.\nTheoretically it's limited to service personnel, but some studies I've heard\nabout have suggested that about half the patients there are civilians who not\nonly have connections but aren't "urgent" at all.\n\nThe problem is, in a system where hospitals' annual budgets are approved by the\ngovernment, how do you keep political considerations out of medical decisions?\nI bet that if you're an MP or MPP, or good friends with one, you're put on any\nhospital's "urgent" care list no matter how minor your problem. Which is OK \nunless you're someone who gets bumped off the list for some bigshot.\n\n\nHmm. How much difference would it make in the figure of percentage of GNP spent\non health care if dentistry and optometry were included in the accounting? \nMaybe Canada spends proportionately just as much on health care as we do.\n\n\nSo what happens if the health care systems financially collapse. Bob Rae, the\nsecond least popular man in Ontario, warned Ontarians a few years ago that if\nthey didn't stop cross-border shopping in such huge numbers, "the services they\nexpect from the province just won't be there in a few years" (Fortunately for\nthem (and less fortunately for the retailers here in Western New York) the \nCanadian dollar went back to a more realistic value). He didn't say so, but I\nknew he meant the OHIP. What would happen if his warning turned out to be the \ntruth? Would the private insurers take up the slack? They'd be under no \nobligation to. Of course, they could eventually make money again, but if what\nyou say is true, they'd be loathe to do so (and out of practice in handling \nsuch basic services, too).\n\n\nWould that it were free. Americans would start another revolution if they had\nto pay taxes at Canadian rates.
How can a witness tell that someone in a burning truck is dead rather than\nunconscious?\n\n\nWhat kind of witnesses?

If this were grounds for a new trial, then the loser\ncould *ALWAYS* get a new trial, and keep doing so until the loser\nbecomes a winner (and then the other side would come up with new\nexpert witnesses).

In regard to Woody's post, I thought I would remind him of something in\nthe midst of his tirade against academia:\nAs a member of the generation likely to pay for the crap Reagan and his cronies started with the deficit according to the brilliant Laffer curve (NOT!)

[Patrick's example of anti-competitive regulations for\n            auto dealers deleted.]\n\nLet me try to drag this discussion back to the original issues.  As\nI've noted before, I'm not necessarily disputing the benefits of \neliminating anti-competitive legislation with regard to auto dealers,\nbarbers, etc.  One need not, however, swallow the entire libertarian\nagenda to accomplish this end.  Just because one grants the benefits of\nallowing anyone who wishes to cut hair to sell his/her services without\nregulation does not mean that the same unregulated barbers should be \nfree to bleed people as a medical service without government intervention.  \n(As some/many libertarians would argue.)  \n\nOn a case by case basis, the cost/benefit ratio of government regulation\nis obviously worthwhile.  The libertarian agenda, however, does not call\nfor this assessment.  It assumes that the costs of regulation (of any\nkind) always outweigh its benefits.  This approach avoids all sorts of \ndifficult analysis, but it strikes many of the rest of us as dogmatic, \nto say the least.\n\nI have no objection to an analysis of medical care, education, \nnational defense or local police that suggests a "free market" can provide\na more effective, efficient means of accomplishing social objectives\nthan is provided through "statist" approaches.   With some notable\nexceptions, however, I do not see such nitty-gritty, worthwhile \nanalysis being carried out by self-professed libertarians.  \n\njsh

If you want to see environmental disasters, go to eastern Europe or some\nparts of the FSU (former Soviet Union).  This is because they had no\nenvironmental protection laws and were trying to increase productivity\nat any expense to justify their political systems.  Luckily for us, some\nof our politicians with vision passed some environmental laws.  That\nisn't to say that they shouldn't be modified, but all I ever hear from\nyou is that the environmental laws were dreamed up by a bunch of\nleft-wing tree-huggers intent on putting us back on horseback.

Geez, where have you been, Ryan?  I proposed this theory *months*\nago.  Let's take it one step further, even.  If, as the surveys show,\nup to 33% of all men have *had* a homosexual encounter, then there must\nbe an even *larger* percentage of people who have had homosexual erotic\nfantasies.  But if less than 10% of the population is gay, what can we\nsay about these people who don't identify as gay but have demonstrated\ngay potential.  Obviously, a large chunk of these people *chose* (or,\nmore accurately, were forced to choose by force of religion and social\nsanction) to put those feelings aside, to be heterosexual.\n\n   Obviously, Cramer and Kaldis fall into this category.\n\n   These people are the ones who are so hung up on "choice."\nObviously, since *they chose*, everyone must have, and homosexuals are\njust flaunting their "perversion" by choosing not to go along with what\nsociety has dictated.\n\n   Of course, I'm that most awful of perverts.  I chose, I gleefully\nadmit that I was heterosexual until I met the right man and *chose* to\nindulge in my homoerotic potential.  Take that!\n\n      Elf !!!\n--\nelf@halcyon.com  (Elf Sternberg)

---------------------------\nThe federal government has used such laws to allow mutliple charges in\norder to prevent more crimes than would nromally occur just from two people\nbeing pissed off at each other. The federal government has an interest in\nthe intent of the perpetrators in the pursuit of preventing violations of\ncivil rights. It's the way they broke the back of the Klan, by putting a\nlot of people away for a very long time for harrassing blacks specifically.\nIt is a principle that has been well recognized as constitutionally valid\nsince over 100 years ago. It has been used whenever a select group was\ngetting bashed or harrassed more than any other person would just for being\npart of a minority. It is the only way we made the defeat of the south\nstick after the Civil War. People who harrassed free blacks, when normally\nthey wouldn't find themselves harrassing just anyone walking around were\nexpeditiously tried and jailed for 5 to 8 years until nobody wanted to try\nit anymore. Now with the 14th amendment guarantee of equal protection under\nthe law, the law can use multiple crime and severe penalty involving intent\nas much as is needed to protect even one human that is a hated minority to\nsomebody. They can call out the national guard just for them, as they did\nthe school girls in Alabama during desegregation in the 1950's, and the\npresident can nationalize the state militia and turn the guns of the\nmilitia that were being used to bar blacks right around to point at the\nthousands in the crowd with an order to shoot that they would have to obey\nor face possible death by firing squad under the Uniform Code of Military\nJustice for failing to obey a direct order while under arms! And by god,\nthey did! Those southern boys turned right around an fixed bayonets! And\nthe governor was left standing and was arrested by the federal marshalls\nthat had brought the order to nationalize the guard. And that's why we need\nsuch an ability in federal jurisdiction.\n-RSW
Your statement is a common misconception, but it just isn't true. In the\nGerman Weimar system, the Chancellor was not necessarily the leader of the\nlargest Reichstag party; the Chancellor was appointed by the President and\ngenerally was the leader of a coalition of parties who could form an effective\nmajority in the Reichstag. Beyond that, the implication that Hitler rose to\nthe Chancellorship because a majority of Germans wanted Nazi rule is false\nas well. Before President Hindenburg appointed Hitler Chancellor in January\n1933, the German people did not show a particular desire to be led either by\nHitler or by the Nazi party. These are the results of the March 1932 election\nfor President, the closest Hitler ever came to direct election: Hindenburg\n49.6%, Hitler 30.1%, Thaelmann 13.2%, Duesterberg 6.8%. In the runoff election\nin April the results were: Hindenburg 53%, Hitler 36.8%, Thaelmann 10.2%.\nSo we can see that Hitler personally was supported by only about a third of\nGerman voters.\n\nSimilarly, the Nazi party never received more than 37% of the vote in\nReichstag elections. That occurred in July 1932. In the November 1932 election\nthe Nazis *lost* two million votes and 34 seats, down from 230 to 196 out of\nthe 608 in the Reichstag. Comparitively, the Socialists had 121 and the\nCommunists 100. The Communists had gained 11 seats, and the German National\nparty, which had supported the previous government, had picked up a million\nof the Nazis' lost votes to gain 15 seats (up to 52). I think the other large\nparty was the Catholic Center party (I don't know how many seats they had but\nI think they were declining), and there were numerous other small parties.\nThus the Nazi vote was on the decline at the time Hitler was appointed\nChancellor.\n\nWhat brought Hitler to power was *not* the demand of the German people for\nHitler or the Nazis to run things, but the inability of the other parties to\nput their differences behind them in favor of forming an effective government\nfor the country. Germany did not have an enduring democratic tradition, and\ntheir parliamentary system lacked effective center parties that favored the\ninterests of the majority of the population. Instead what they had was a\nnumber of small parties who were unable to put aside their own specific\nobjectives in order to combine against the Nazis, who were out to end the\ndemocratic process. In fact, part of the problem was that some of the other\nparties with substantial representation, like the Communists, were also\nout to end the democratic process, but with different results in mind, and\ngenerally didn't mind seeing parliamentary democracy go under.\n\nGermany had already had a non-Nazi Chancellor with a majority coalition\nfor five months while the Nazis had been the largest Reichstag party, and\nthere certainly was no danger of a revolution in favor of the Nazis.\nIf anything the Nazis were starting to get desperate because they had failed\nto get enough support to make Hitler President and their popular vote had\nbegun to decline.\n\nHitler was not Hindenburg's first choice to be Chancellor, not even his\nsecond choice. First, von Papen had been Chancellor since June 1932. After\nthe November election when the Nazis *lost* seats, Hindenburg first prevailed\non von Papen to remain as Chancellor. But there were intrigues behind his back\nand support for him was lacking. So then Hindenburg turned to von Schleicher,\nwho became Chancellor for two months. Eventually he too was unable to hold\ntogether a working coalition of parties to oppose the Nazis, who refused to\nparticipate in any government that was not led by a Nazi Chancellor. Some of\nthe Nazi leadership, particularly Gregor Strasser who was the #2 man in the\nparty at the time, wanted to participate in a coalition government. But others,\nknowing the party's support was waning, figured that their best hope to gain\npower lay in undermining the democratic process. Nevertheless, the country\nwas governed for seven months by Chancellors who were not Nazis, even though\nthe Nazis were the largest Reichstag party. The failure of these men to\nachieve a working coalition was due to the inability of their coalition\nparties to work together.\n\nHere's how William Shirer puts it in _The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich_:\n\n   The cardinal error of the Germans who opposed Nazism was their\n   failure to unite against it. At the crest of their popular strength,\n   in July 1932, the National Socialists had attained but 37 percent of\n   the vote. But the 63 percent of the German people who expressed their\n   opposition to Hitler were much too divided and shortsighted to combine\n   against a common danger which they must have known would overwhelm\n   them unless they united, however temporarily, to stamp it out.\n\nTrue, the German people supported Hitler after he became Chancellor. But\nthat doesn't change the fact that there was not overwhelming support for him\n*before* he was in power. The German people were not crying out for Hitler to\ntake over, no matter how bad economic conditions were. The leftist parties\n(Socialists/Communists) probably had more support in total than the Nazis.\nHitler used the fact that others were passively or actively willing to see\nthe government paralyzed as a means to taking it over.
It seems to deter those who are executed from future criminal activity.\n\n\nWhy don't you compare the rates at which blacks and whites commit crimes?\nBlacks commit crimes disproportionately, so in a perfectly fair penal\nsystem, blacks would be disproportionately represented.\n\n(Note: black vs. white crime rates is not a racial thing.  It's probably\nan economic thing: poor people are more likely to commit crimes, and blacks\nare more likely to be poor.  The way to reduce the proportion of minorities\nin prison is to increase the wealth of minorities.)

Since we are talking in theory and opinion, then I'll put in my $.02.\n	First, a rebuttle. Personally, I love under-dogs. Unlike \nbandwagon jumpers, I abandon teams when they start winning. People that\ncheer for winners just because they are winners are insecure people who are\nafraid to be associated with something negative.\n\n\nOn this one point, I agree. The reason that people bash WASP's is \nbecause they have been on top for a long time. Whoever is on top is\ngoing to oppress whoever is below them so that they can stay on top.\nIf Hannibal had pushed on to Rome after his victory at Cannae we might\nall be bashing the blacks for oppressing us peacefull white people \nfor all these centuries. I seriously doubt that if the blacks had \nconquered the world that they would have treated their colonies any\nbetter/worse than the whites did.\n	The white race did some unspeakable things to the other races of\nthe world. But they only did what any other conquering race would have done\n(ie. Khan). The real question is, should we carry over that blame to the\npresent generation who didn't participate in the crimes? Would it do \nany good? Has it done Bosnia any good? They are fighting wars that stopped\nhundreds, even thousands, of years ago. \n	My opinion is, if there are inequities now, then let's change\nthem. But don't blame me for what my ancestors did. It wouldn't settle\nanything anyway.\n\n\nThat's where you are dead wrong. You don't join up on a side just because\nthey are winning. That makes you spineless. Winning, in high school and\nafter high school, is still the best way to be popular, but it doesn't make\nyou right. All the best causes in history were loosing causes (with only\na couple exceptions). Winning only makes a difference to other people, not\nto yourself. And what good is the opinions of other people if they only care\nhow you appear (ie. a Winner).\n\n	If you can't beat them, fight them every inch of the way. \n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n"At that moment the bottom fell out of Authur's mind.

Enemy?  Sounds like that's the viewpoint of the stereotypical rednecked\nconservative -- 'always been commies, always will be.'  I suggest you\nlisten very carefully to the stuff Yeltsin and his people are saying\nand compare that with the very anti-West slogans coming from his\nopponents in the Russian congress.  I sure know who I want to back.\n\nOh, BTW, Germany has sure come back as a terrible enemy after WWII,\nhasn't it?\n\nBetter to let them degenerate into civil war?  Remember all those\nnuclear weapons in Russia.  I cannot imagine that they would not\nbe used in a civil war.  If nationialists take over and, even if\nthey prevent a civil war, most feel they must take back large\nparts of land that are in other countries (like Ukraine.)  I also cannot\nimagine Ukraine giving up land without a fight, possibly nuclear.\n\nHow does this affect us?  Well, we are on the same planet and if\nvast tracks of Europe are blown away I think we'd feel something.\nA massive breakup of a country that spans 1/6th the planet is\nbound to have affects here.  (Of course, there is also the\nhumanitarian argument that democracies should help other\ndemocracies (or struggling democracies).)\n\n\nSeriously.  Everyone has different opinions on what is stupid.\nMy two "causes" are aid to Russia and a strong space program.\nSomeone else will champion welfare or education or doing studies\nof drunken goldfish.  That is why we have a republic and not a\ntrue democracy.  Instead of gridlock on a massive scale, we\nonly have gridlock on a congressional scale.\n\nBTW, who is to decide 'stupid?'  This is just like those who\nwant to impose their 'morals' on others -- just the sort of\nthing I thought Libertarians were against.\n\nActually, my politics are pretty Libertarian except on this one issue \nand this is why it is impossible for me to join the party.  It seems\nthat Libertarians want to withdraw from the rest of the world and\nlet it sink or swim.  We could do that 100 years ago but not now.\nLike it or not we are in the beginnings of a global economy and\nglobal decision making.

THE WHITE HOUSE\n\n                    Office of the Press Secretary\n\n_____________________________________________________________________\nFor Immediate Release                                   April 5, 1993\n\n\n                            PRESS BRIEFING\n                       BY GEORGE STEPHANOPOLOUS\n\n\n                          The Briefing Room\n\n\n 10:10 A.M. EDT\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  As you know, the President is soon \nto be on his way, on Amtrack to Camden Yards.  He'll be throwing out \nthe first pitch.\n	     \n	     Q	  It's MARC, the Maryland Area Transit, it's not \nAmtrack.\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Oh, it's not Amtrack?  Well, he's \ngoing from Union Station, you're right.  Excuse me.\n	     \n	     Q	  George, what exactly are you prepared to do to \nbreak the logjam with  ??? Senate?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, as you know, there are \ndiscussions between Senator Mitchell and Senator Dole this morning, \nand I think that the President is going to continue to make the point \nthat he believes that our investment package, our jobs package needs \nto be passed as quickly as possible.  We need this investment for \nsummer jobs, for immunization, for highway construction, for the \nimportant programs that will put people back to work right away this \nsummer.  And the President continues to believe his program should be \npassed.\n	     \n	     Q	  Will he compromise, that's the question?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, as you know, the discussions \nare going on this morning in the Senate betwen Senator Mitchell and \nSenator Dole, let's see what they come up with.  But the President \nbelieves his jobs program should go forward.\n	     \n	     Q	  George, would the President be willing to accept $8 \nbillion for one year, which apparently appears to be the compromise \nbeing offered by --\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I don't know what is being \noffered by either side.  The Senate discussions are going on right \nnow, let's see what happens today.\n	     \n	     Q	  Would he go that far -- no matter what the \nRepublicans have offered so far, would he go that far, $8 billion per \nyear?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President believes that his \nprogram should be passed at this time.  Clearly, we're going to be \nwilling to listen to what the Senators might or might not be able to \ncome up with, but I'm not going to get into figures right now.  Let's \nsee what happens.\n	     \n	     Q	  It's reasonable to assume, isn't it, from what has \nhappened so far that a compromise is going to be necessary in order \nto get a vote?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the Republicans seem more \nintrested in stopping progress on the President's jobs bill, than in \ndoing something to create --  MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the \nRepublicans seem more interested in stopping progress on the \nPresident's jobs bill than in doing something to create real action, \nreal jobs this summer for the American people.  I think there's no \nquestion about that.  There's been some frustration of legislative \nactivity over the last few days.\n	     \n	     Q	  So, you'll need to compromise to get your package \nthrough?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We'll see what happens with the \nconversations between Senator Mitchell and Senator Dole this morning.\n	     \n	     Q	     prepared to compromise --\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President's prepared to listen \nto what Senator Mitchell has to say this morning after his meeting \nwith Senator Dole. \n	     \n	     Q	  Does he feel that he has been defeated in his --\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not in the least.  In fact, he's \nbeen very successful so far in the beginning of his term.\n	     \n	     Q	  How?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He passed his budget in record \ntime, in six weeks, and it's a budget which reduces the deficit by \n$500 billion over five years.  And it's a budget which provides for \nimportant investments in our future.  Right now we've also had strong \npassage of his jobs program through the House.  Simply because a \nminority of Republicans in the Senate choose to perpetuate gridlock \nand hold up action on the President's jobs program is not a sign that \nhe is not succeeding overall.\n	     \n	     Q	  He can't beat this, can he?\n	     \n	     Q	  The fact is they can do that?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the Republicans can stop \naction.  There's no question about that.\n	     \n	     Q	  What are you going to do about it?\n	     \n	     Q	  George, what do you know about these alleged notes \ntaken by Boris Yeltsin during one of the meetings in which it appears \nthat the President told Boris Yeltsin not to trust the Japanese; that \nwhen they say yes they mean no?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think that's a complete \nmisreading of what happened at the meeting.  The context of the \nconversation was that President Clinton was actually reassuring \nPresident Yeltsin at the time about his conversations with Prime \nMinister Miyazawa over the Kuril Islands and the Prime Minister's \nbelief that Japan would play a constructive role in the G-7 process.  \nI mean this was a casual comment about Japanese courtesy and \netiquette but overall it was in the context of a conversation where \nhe was reassuring President Yeltsin that he believed the Japanese \nwere serious about their commitment to the G-7 process.\n	     \n	     Q	   Are you saying that the President said that when \nthe Japanese say yes they mean no?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That's not -- I don't know the \nexact words and there was a much longer discussion about he did say \nsomething along the lines that he believes that on this issue Prime \nMinister Miyazawa intends to really go forward with the G-7 process.\n	     \n	     Q	  Have there been any attempts to explain this to the \nJapanese because apparently the Japanese press has picked this up and \nthere appears to be --\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I've seen the reports in the \nJapanese press and it actually does put the situation in context.  It \ndoes talk about the Japanese -- understanding the Japanese points of \nview.  I don't think it's going to be a problem.  I believe that \nthere may have been some diplomatic context just to clear things up \nbut I'm not positive.\n	     \n	     Q	  George, was the specific comment that was made \nspecific to the Kuril Island situation or was it a general \nobservation on Japanese etiquette?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The discussion was about --\n	     \n	     Q	  The specific comment is what I'm asking about that \nhas alleged to have been translated from the Russian notes, "when the \nJapanese say yes they mean no."\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, it was a combination.  I mean \nI don't think that's the whole sentence.  I think that the specific \ncomment was a broad, general observation followed up by a specific \nfinish to the sentence where he said in this case he believes that \nPrime Minister Miyazawa means to keep the commitment.\n	     \n	     Q	  Was he saying it facetiously first?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think it was just a casual \nobservation.\n	     \n	     Q	  And then you say diplomatic contacts were made to \nclear it up.  Has the President sent a message?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, I don't think the President \nspoke; I believe that Secretary Christopher has made some calls but \nI'm not sure exactly how many.\n	     \n	     Q	  Well, this obviously is a bigger deal than you're \nmaking it out to be if Christopher has had to make some calls.\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, no.  It was just that we got \nthe reports in Vancouver and the Secretary wanted to make sure that \nit was understood and make sure there was absolutely no \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  -- reports in Vancouver, and the \nSecretary wanted to make sure that it was understood, and make sure \nthere is absolutely no misunderstanding, and I don't believe there is \non.\n	     \n	     Q	  What is our position about the Japanese?  That they \nmay have to say one thing, but actualy mean another?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No.  The position on the Japanese \nis as the President stated to President Yeltsin throughout the two \ndays.  He said that he had had a good conversation with Prime \nMinister Miazawa prior to the Summit.  He reiterated the U.S. \nposition, the long-standing support for the Japanese position on the \nKuril Islands, but also reiterated Prime Minister Miazawa's \ncommitment to move forward on the G-7 process and to play a \nconstructive role.  And I think President Yeltsin was very glad to \nhear that.\n	     \n	     Q	  After listening to Secretary Christopher on Iraq \nfor the last few days, I'm a little confused.  What is the U.S. \npolicy?  Do you want to see Saddam Hussein overturned?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's the same policy that Secretary \nChristopher has reiterated, and all of the U.S officials have \nreiterated.  We expect full and complete and unequivocal compliance \nwith all U.N. resolutions.  Right now we do not have that compliance.\n	     \n	     Q	     throwing it out further that if Iraq complies, \nSaddam can't stay in office?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Right.  I think that that's -- our \njudgment is that it is not possible for Saddam Hussein to comply with \nthe resolutions and stay in power.  But the important point is that \nwe expect compliance by Iraq with all U.N. resolutions, and we will \ncontinue to demand it.\n	     \n	     Q	  And are you concerned the Iran will become the \ndominant power in the area --\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Secretary Christopher has also \nspoken to Iran over the last several days, and he says we also expect \nfull Iranian compliance with all international norms, and stopping \nsupport of terrorism.\n	     \n	     Q	  That's a very glib statement that he won't stay in \npower if he complies with U.N. resolutions.  On what logic do you \nbase that?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Right now Saddam Hussein is not \ncomplying with the U.N. resolutions at all.  He is not respecting the \nrights of his people, as is required by the U.N. resolution.  He is \nnot fully complying with all the resolutions regarding inspections.  \nHe is not fully complying with all the resolutions regarding \narmaments.\n	     \n	     Q	  Well, when do you think that if he did comply he \nwould be out of power?\n\n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, right now his power rests on \nthe repression of his people.  If he stopped doing that it would make \nit more difficult for him to stay in power.\n	     \n	     Q	  George, back on the stimulus package, why is it \nthat you and the President accuse the Republicans of playing pure \npolitics and perpetuating gridlock?  Why is it that -- what evidence \ndo you have that they just don't have a genuine idealogical \ndifference with you that's in good faith?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the fact that several times \nin the past the Republicans, many of the ones who are now leading the \nfight for the filibuster, have supported the very funding they now \nseek to stop, most especially, the highway funding.  \n	     \n	     Q	  George, in regards to that, some of the moderate \nRepublicans said that the White House erred by not being more open to \nthem during the -- while the plan was put together, that they had \none, sort of, proforma meeting between the White House and the Senate \nRepublicans, and that was it.  Does the Administration look back and \nthinks perhaps it could have done a better job of working with some -\n-\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I'm not sure that it's true \nthat there was only one meeting.  I mean, the President met with the \nRepublican leadership on at least two occasions before the \nintroduction of his package.  He met with the entire Senate \nRepublican Caucus also for lunch, and went up there.  We are \ncontinually in contact with as many Republicans as we can find who \nhave an interest in the President's package.  We are interested in \nwhat they have to say, as well.  But we believe that this program is \nimportant, and we're going to continue to fight for it.\n	     \n	     Q	     your all or nothing, do it with the Democrats \nalone strategy, did you maybe miscalculate the ability to get it \nthrough?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I mean, I think that there is \nno question that under the Senate rules a determined minority can \nfrustrate activity.  I mean, there is just no question about that.  \nYou only need 40 plus one to keep going.  40 plus one to keep going \nand to stop any action, and that's what the Republicans are doing.\n	     \n	     Q	     going to rethink the way you attempt to get \nother things passed as you go through this process for the rest of \nthe summer?\n	     \n	     Q	     work with Republicans and try to woo some \nRepublicans into your camp?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think we're going to continue to \nlook for the support of Republicans whenever we can get it on the \nPresident's intiatives?\n	     \n	     Q	  But on this one -- how are you going to do it \ndifferently than you did it on this one because on this one you \nreally did stiff the Republicans from the beginning and made it clear \nthat it was a Democratic majority that would get this through and \ncould get it through and you really didn't need Republican votes?  \nAre you going to take a different tack when you have to go for \nparticular votes?  When you have to go through --\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I can't see into the future and \nunderstand every possible turn in the legislative road.  Clearly the \nPresident's going to continue to reach out when he can.\n	     \n	     Q	  You don't have any regrets then about the way you \nhave handled it up to now and you don't plan any changes in your \napproach in dealing with the Republicans in Congress based on this \nexperience?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Obviously the President would like \nhis package passed as quickly as possible and he's going to continue \nto press for that.  We will continue to reach out to Republicans, \nthere's not question about that.  And we'll continue to reason with \nthem and try and find appropriate avenues for cooperation.  In this \ncase the Republicans have chosen to unify around a filibuster, around \na plan to frustrate action not a plan to move forward.\n	     \n	     Q	  They're being denied any other legislative means of \nputting their proposals forward.\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think they're being --\n	     \n	     Q	     any ideas.\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think their amendments are being \ndefeated; I don't know that they're being denied.\n	     \n	     Q	     to present them.\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That's not exactly true.  I mean \nthey get the votes --\n	     \n	     Q	     that theirs can be passed though by the \nparliamentary rules under which they're playing.\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Unless they get a majority in \nsupport all the way around, no, that's not exactly true.\n	     \n	     Q	  George, one more on Iraq.  Is the administration \nbacking any of the Iraqi opposition?  Grooming any new leadership?\n	     \n	     Q	     backing any of the Iraqi -- leadership?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Oh, I -- again, we're pressing for \nIraqi compliance.  I don't know if we can get into the business of \ngrooming leadership.  I believe there have been some contacts, at \nsome levels, with Iraqi opposition groups.  I don't know  about \nanything recently.\n	     \n	     Q	     Jesse Jackson, who, of course, is not the \nPresident's best friend, has, however, been told that there is to be \nsome kind of town meeting, or some kind of involvement by the \nPresident, pre-empted the ball game -- Los Angeles.  Will he consider \nsomething like that, or any other kind of intervention there?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, as you know, the President \nappointed Commerce Secretary Ron Brown, about 10 days ago, to be a \nspecial envoy to California, and coordiante cabinet activities around \nthe California economic situation, including the situation in Los \nAngeles.  \n	     \n	     I believe there will also be visits out to Los Angeles \nby the Education -- or have been visits by the Education Secretary, \nMr. Riley.  I believe that Transportation Secretary Pena and HUD \nSecretary Cisneros are also going out.  And there may be other visits \nby Cabinet officials over the next several days and weeks.  I \nwouldn't rule out the possibility of a visit by President Clinton to \nCalifornia.  Obviously, he is following the situation closely, and is \nconcerned about making sure that we make the right long term policy \ndecisions that will help create the kind of economic opportunities \nwhich help prevent disturbances.  But we're going to continue to \nwatch it.\n	     \n	     Q	  George, as a follow-up, Reverend Jackson is also \nsupposed to be outside the ball park today, in Baltimore, with a \ngroup of supporters protesting the lack of minorities in baseball \nmanagement.  Does the President have a position on that?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President has received \ncorrespondence from Reverend Jackson.  I know that Reverend Jackson \nhas also spoken with the White House Chief of Staff, Mack McLarty.  \nHe clearly raises serious questions.  There has been some progress in \nbaseball over the last several years, but still not enough.  But the \nPresident intends to continue to go to the ball game.\n	     \n	     Q	  Is he going to say anything about it today, or see \nReverend Jackson while he's out there?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know if he is going to see \nthem, but as I said, the President believes that Reverend Jackson has \nraised some serious questions, and it's something that, as I said, \neven though there has been progress, it's clearly not enough.\n	     \n	     Q	  Did Reverend Jackson ask him not to go to the ball \ngame?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm not sure about that.  I believe \nthe characterization the Reverend Jackson is talking about is an \ninformational pickett.  I don't know that he asked him not to go to \nthe ball game, but he sent a long, detailed, formal letter outlining \nhis concerns with the situation in major league baseball and the \nPresident read it.\n	     \n	     Q	  George, the Orioles are playing the Rangers, the \nmanaging partner of the Rangers is George W. Bush.  Is he going to be \nthere, and is he going to meet with the President?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know.\n	     \n	     Q	  What is the Mubarak schedule?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I know that President Mubarak is \ncoming tomorrow morning for a working meeting, they will have a \nlunch, and I believe that he is having dinner tonight with Vice \nPresident Gore.\n	     \n	     Q	  And joint statements tomorrow --\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I believe so, yes.  At the end, \nyes.\n	     \n	     Q	  Is there evidence, George, that the Egyptians did \nwarn the U.S. about a potential terrorist bombing -- terrorist \nactivities?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  As reported in The New York Times, \nI mean, I think that President Mubarak did say that there has been \ngeneral conversations with the Egyptians, as there have been for a \nlong period of time.  We do have general intelligence sharing, I \nmean.  But President Mubarak was very careful to point out that there \nwas no specific information on this visit that was passed forward.  \nThe President will continue to investigate the situation, but he also \nreiterates his belief that we cannot tolerate terrorism of any kind.\n	     \n	     Q	  George, he did make specific -- or the Egyptians, \napparently, did issue specific warnings about this individual who, \nforgive me --this individual who, forgive me the name escapes me at \nthe moment, and said the Egyptians were more or less rebuffed in \ntheir attempts to get some kind of action.\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I don't know if I would \nagree with your characterization of the Mubarak interview.  He did \nsay that they gave general warnings about the possibility of a \nnetwork in the United States and upon which we took appropriate \naction.  But there was no specific information on this specific \noperation at all.\n	     \n	     Q	  So, the White House doesn't feel that any of the \nlaw enforcement agencies whether it be the CIA or FBI who would have \nreceived this kind of information was lax or derelict in its duty in \nnot pursuing some kind of --\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, not at all.\n	     \n	     Q	  What's next with Serbia?  It got only a passing \nmention in the news conference yesterday --\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  You didn't get to ask your \nquestion.\n	     \n	     Q	  Yes, exactly.  Was there any agreement on concerted \naction between the two countries?  And even if there wasn't, what \ndoes the U.S. do next?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think the U.S. is clearly going \nto move forward in the U.N. today continuing discussions with our \nallies on a sanctions resolution and we'll continue to look for ways \nto press the Serbians to come to the negotiating table and sign an \nagreement.\n	     \n	     Q	  George, why do you think sanctions is still an \noption?  I mean the Serbians make it clear that at least the \nleadership is surviving just fine and they feel like they can wait \nyou out and even the administration officials we had in the other day \nsaid there's no evidence that they're going to have an effect any \ntime soon.  The Bosnian Serbs have said no to the peace plan.  When \ndoes no mean no and you have to do something different?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I mean we are doing something \ndifferent.  We're moving forward on further sanctions through the \nU.N. and those discussions will continue.  We're going to continue to \ntry and tighten the noose on Serbia, and I think that every \nopportunity we have to do that will have an effect over time.\n	     \n	     Q	  Are we looking again at lifting the arms embargo? \nMR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President has said that this is something \nthat is under consideration.\n	     \n	     Q	  George, do you have any more on Hugh Rodham's \ncondition, how he's doing?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  As far as I know nothing's changed.\n	     \n	     Q	  George, -- week after Mr. Mubarak?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's a little unclear.  I think \nwe'll be able to get you more either tonight or tomorrow morning \nafter the Mubarak visit.\n	     \n	     Q	  Is he going somewhere for Easter?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not that I know of.\n	     \n	     Q	  What more can you tell us about the additional aid \nto Russia that the President plans to ask Congress about?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He's going to be consulting with \nthe Congress and with our G-7 partners over the next couple of weeks.  \nI know that he spoke last evening with Congressman Gephardt and their \ndelegation before the -- the congressional delegation meets with the \nRussians this week and those consultations will continue over the \nnext several weeks.\n	     \n	     Q	  Do you expect that package to be of the magnitude \nof the one announced Sunday?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm not going to discuss the \nmagnitude.\n	     \n	     Q	  How about the list of Cold War restrictions, where \ndo you stand on that --\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  As the President said yesterday, \nhe's going to be looking for that list from the Congress this week \nand reviewing it.  He believes -- he's going to try and get it this \nweek and he's going to review the list, and we're going to take a \nhard look at it.\n	     \n	     Q	  But they're making it up?  I mean it's no White \nHouse involvement, Congress is compiling this list?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think he's going to talk to the \ncongressional leaders about compiling the list but I'm certain we'll \nbe able to get our own researchers working as well.\n	     \n	     Q	  George, isn't lifting the arms embargo more of a \nprobability than a possibility?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's something that's under \ndiscussion.\n	     \n	     Q	  Secretary Christopher has said that it's a matter \nof time and -- for months before that happens.\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, all I can say is that it's \nsomething that the President is reviewing.  Right now we're working \nwith our allies in the U.N on a sanctions resolution, and we'll \ncontinue to review other matters.\n	     \n	     Q	  George, can you tell us anything about the schedule \nthis week?  Any travel?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  They just asked about that.  I \ndon't have anything more beyond tomorrow's visit with Mubarak right \nnow.\n	     \n	     Q	  Are there consultations, George, with any Jewish \nAmerican organizations concerning Jackson-Vanick?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  As you know the National Conference \nof Soviet Jewry has a list of, I believe, \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  -- as you know, the National \nConference of Soviet Jewry has a list of, I believe, 200 Refuseniks.  \nWe'll certainly take a look at that and continue appropriate \ndiscussions.\n	     \n	     Thanks.

# #The official and legal term for rape is "the crime of forcing a FEMALE \n# #to submit to sexual intercourse."\n# \n# Please, supply me with some references.  I was not aware that all states\n# had the word "FEMALE" in the rape statutes.  I am sure others are surprised\n# as well.  I know thats how it works in practice (nice-n-fair, NOT!!), but\n# was unaware that it was in the statutes as applying to FEMALES only,\n# uniformly throughout the U.S.\n# \n# -Chris\n\nThere may be some confusion here.  The Uniform Crime Reports program\nrun by the FBI defines rape as a female victim only crime -- even\nthough some states have the laws de-sexed.  I suspect that this causes\nmale victims of rape to be left out of the UCR data.
If the heading is true, Mr. Frank should be ashamed of himself.\n\nNothing makes me gag more than people who don't respect the\nrights of others to voice their opinions.  My idol Lenny Bruce\nonce commented about "that asshole Time Magazine" when they\nadvocated censorship of his material.  Time actually sided\nwith the cops' and their arresting of Bruce at his shows,\nwhereby he routinely would say "cocksucker", then the cops\nwould rush the stage to arrest him.  My, how the times haven't\nchanged...\n\nI can't help but think of how Lenny would be received in today's\npolitically correct arena.  Heck, I even support the right of\nneo nazis to speak their opinions and march down the streets.\n\nAnd before Mr. Frank or anyone else makes any wisecracks about\nanti-Semitism...I'm Jewish, a longtime member of AIPAC and the JNF,\nand have contributed over $1000 apiece to these fine groups.  I'm\na regular contributor to every pro-Israel group I can find, but I\nstill support the right of people like Arf to speak up and vomit\nhis propaganda.\n\nI want to know just WHO these people are !!!\n\nI'm basing all this on the assumption that Mr. Frank did indeed\nwrite to some sysadmin requesting Mr. Teel to be admonished.  If\nthis is not the case, I hereby retract these nasties directed\ntoward him.  If not, I stand against Mr. Frank and his trashing\nof the First Amendment.
Nationwide, the immunization rate among toddlers is about 50%, but\n    it is reportedly as low as 10% in some inner-city neighborhoods.\n    I bet more than 10% kids living in such neighborhoods are already \n    covered by Medicaid.\n\n    Here in Massachussets, we have had a universal immunization program,\n    the kind of Clinton seems to be proposing, for many years (two decades?).\n    Mass' immunization rate is 65%.

# 179 Czech Republic  # 180 Republic of Slovakia  They were admitted early\n      this year.  Liechenstein was also recently admitted.  Also San Marino.\n       Both within the last 12 months.  Incredible what passes for a nation-sta\n           state nowadays.
Note that the laws that don't agree with you were passed to protect\na class of people who couldn't get justice from the state courts;\nspecifically civil rights workers in Missisippi in the 60's. The \nfederal protection of individual rights supersedes the non-feasance\nof the state. Something similar has long been traditional ( well\nhe's queer so I beat him up...) for gays\n\n\nAs Anatole France said; "The law in its impartial majesty forbids the\nrich as well as the poor from sleeping under bridges."\n\nEquality of law can be construed in any number of ways. For example\nthe fact that all property thefts, regardless of value, are not\npunished equally is an inequality which protects those who have\na lot of money from having it stolen. You could easily define\nequality to regard the property in terms of it's significance\nfor the owner. This would a form of equality that would be skewed\ntoward poorer people.\n\nIn fact, most anti-gay bashing laws are constructed to offer equal \nprotection. They make it an offense to damage people based on a \nmotivation of hatred for sexual orientation. Thus the law in its\nimpartial majesty protects hets as well as gays from being bashed.\nI'm sure that's a great relief to Douglas Meier.
This seems a strange argument to make considering that Canada's\nviolent crime rate in general is far lower than that of the U.S.  (Our\nnon-gun crime rate is greater than their *entire* crime rate).  It\nwould seem strange to suggest that it, to, were the result of gun\ncontrol laws.\n\n       I think if we looked we'd find very specific (cultural and\nenforcement) reasons why the non-gun rate is low as well, and then\nthat reasons could be applied to the with-gun rates as easily.\n\n\n       Aside from the fact that I find the idea of being punished\nbecause somebody might steal something from me and go and commit a\ncrime with it a silly solution, it still doesn't address the\nquestion of Canada.  (Which is now, by the way, blaming their rising\ngun-crime rate on the U.S.  Strange that the border used to "magically"\nkeep the guns out, but now isn't.)\n\n\n       The other side of the coin, of course, is that far "illegal drugs"\nare purchases legally or stolen from people who purchase them legally. \nI've still not been convinced that guns, a commodity which criminals\nhave shown their perfectly willing to pay for from illegal sources\n(stolen either from police, military, or civilian) we wouldn't simply\nsee South American sources from which drugs come start smuggling guns as\nwell, since there's a thriving gun manufacturing industry down there.\n\n\n        And as was not pointed out in the study, but in critiques\nof it, (two seperate articles by James Wright and David Kopel come\nto mind) it was pointed out that the difference was *also* almost\nentirely minority related.  That is, the gun crime rate skyrocketed\nfor poor minorities (Blacks and Hispanics primarily) while when you\ncompared the white majority they were virutally identical.\n\n        The problem with the NEJM study was they compared minority vs.\nnon-minority percentages but failed to take into account the relative\nconditions of those minorities.  That there was an eqaul percentage of\nnomn-whites was about as far as they went.  They failed to take into\naccount that the non-whites in either city were not living in the\nsame conditions.\n\n        If the situation was entirely based on availability of guns,\nthen we'd expect that the white rates, the two groups which are\narguably fairly comparative in the two cities, would have a far\nhigher rate in Seattle.  Yet the majority in Seattle is not only\nnot significantly higher when the minorities are excluded, but slightly\nlower.\n\n\n\n       The point is, of course, that many of the U.S. "inner-city"\nproblems are not mirrored in Canada.  As such  if there is a condition\nwhich is significantly different in Canada from the U.S., and violent\ncrime is highly correlated to that area, suggesting that gun control\nis the source of Canada's low rate is highly questionable.  (As one\nCanadian pointed out on talk.politics.guns, Canada's major gun control\nin 1978 did not result in either a reduction or a slowing of an increase\nin violent crime rates, which have been rising steadily since.  Apparently\nthey didn't even mirror the U.S.s very large drop of violent crime in\nthe early eighties.\n\n\n       True only to a certain extent.  Take Washington D.C., where\ngun control was instituted while it had crime problems true, but that\ncrime proceeded to explode afterwards.  Similarly for New York.\n\n       The question is not simply a point in time where crime was high\nor low.  Did the gun control significantly and positively impact\nviolent crime.  Since it's gone up in those areas, often faster than it\nwas going up before, you can't simply dismiss the high crime rate by\nsaying gun control was caused by it.  Yes, gun control may be instituted\nto deal with high crime.  But if the crime is not positively impacted, you\ncan't continually say that that crime rate was entirely a cause of\nthat gun control, since much of that crime rate increased after gun control\nwas implemented, just as happened in Canada.\n\n\n       As would be expected if violent crime was generally independent\nof gun control.\n\n\n       Would this be the laws which made manufacturers liable for what\nothers did with their guns, and suddenly the police found nobody would\nsell to them?
I wonder if he realizes the irony of a Federal Secretary\ninvoking a rabid anti-federalist in support of federal education\nprograms?
Isn't is funny how someone who seems to know nothing about homosexuality \nuses a very flawed (IMHO) source of information to pass jusgement on all \nhomosexual and bisexual men.  It would seem more logical to say that since \nthe heterosexual group of men is larger then the chances of promiscuity \nlarger as well.  In my opinion, orientation has nothing to do with it.\n\nMen are men and they all like sex.  I am a gay male.  I have had sex three \ntimes in my life, all with the same man.  Before that, I was a virgin.\n\nSo... whose promiscuous?\n\nJust because someone is gay doesn't mean they have no morals.  Just because \nsomeone is heterosexual doesn't mean they do.  Look at the world....  \nStatistics alone prove that most criminals are by default hetero...\n\nLook closely at the person, not the group.\n\nAll flames will be ignored.  :)\n\nLater,
Candidate Clinton promised to tax the rich, and most folks thought that\nwas a pretty nifty idea.  Then President Clinton said he wanted families\nwho make more than $100,000 to bear 70% of the new tax burden, and many\nwere quick to complain that their six-figure income does not make them one\nof the well-to-do.  It's particularly ironic (to me) that it's in those\ntraditionally liberal enclaves of the Bay Area and academia where the\nwealthy are struggling so to fit themselves into the mantle of "just\nregular working-class folk".\n\nNobody will ever admit to being rich; everybody's middle class.  So who\nare The Rich?  Well, I'll throw out some stats from the 1990 Census and\nlet you be the judge...\n\nVa negvpyr <mzimmersC5E1qK.Fn9@netcom.com>\nmzimmers@netcom.com (Michael Zimmers) jevgrf:\n} In article <1qcdvbINN5ti@elroy.jpl.nasa.gov>\n} > [...]\n} >that would be about $55 to 65 thousand US, and that is what tenured\n} >professors can expect to make.  For a PhD with say 10 years experience,\n} >$65,000 is a lot less than what he could be making in industry.  \n} \n} Oh?  As a 12-year veteran of Silicon Valley, I've seen precious few\n} employment ads that call for PhDs.  And $65K is hardly chump change;\n} it's well above the median *household* income for the state.\n\nBay Area average household income is in the mid-$40,000 range.  National\naverage is $31,889.  The Bay Area has nearly twice the national average\nof six-figure income households (9.1% vs 4.8%*).  The cost-of-living here\nmay be high, but I don't think it's twice the national average...\n\n} >In Los Angeles, modest home prices can be $500,000.  \n\nA 1,500-square-foot tract house in a Bay Area working-class neighborhood\ngoes for about $250,000.  I doubt that the Los Angeles market is all that\ndifferent.  It would appear that this definition of "modest" is perhaps a\nbit immoderate...\n\n} So what?  They're no cheaper for those who are gainfully employed.\n} \n} >In California, $65,000 is not upper-middle-class.\n} \n} It depends upon your definition; it's clearly above average.\n\nIt is more than what two-thirds of California households make.  Seems\nto me that belonging to the upper one-third is not an unreasonable\ndefinition of "upper-middle-class".  Note that if that professor's\nspouse earns $35,000 they become one of Clinton's "rich" families.\n\nHere's a breakdown of national, California, and Bay Area household incomes:\n\n   <$30K  $30-50K   $50-100K  $100K+\n------------------------------------\nUS  49%     24%        23%      4% * the Census Bureau did some weird\nCA  41%     26%        26%      7%   rounding here...more like 5%\nBA  34%     25%        31%      9%\n\nAnd to add a little prespective:\n\nA minimum wage earner working 40 hours/week makes $8,840/year.  The poverty\nline for a family of four is $15,171.  If they make up to twice that, the\ngovernment considers them to be "working poor".  Say we decide to call this\nthe "lower-middle-class".  Then how 'bout:\n\n$30-50K annual income is "middle-class".  $50-100K is "upper-middle-class".\n$100K+ is "rich".  $1,000K+ is "filthy-rich".  and $10,000+ is "Bill Gates".\n\nmake sense? ;^)\n\n-timr
Of course, one again faces the question of how one circumscribes government\npower (and keeps it circumscribed) in a complex society when it is in the \ninterest of neither capitalists nor consumers to refrain from using \ngovernment power for their own ends.  But apart from that little \nconundrum...\n\nIt would seem that a society with a "failed" government would be an ideal\nsetting for libertarian ideals to be implemented.  Now why do you suppose\nthat never seems to occur?...\n\nI wouldn't call it "vague."  I'd call it elastic.  All "regulation" is \nnot necessarily the same.  By opposing all government regulation, some \nlibertarians treat every system from a command economy to those that\nregulate relatively free markets as identical.  That's one reason\nmany of the rest of us find their analysis to be simplistic. \n\njsh
I am glad that you recognize that people should not engage in denial\nand repression, and should acknowledge such. The United States, with\nits people, have recognized that repression has taken place, with the\nloss and outright abrogation of civil liberties and constitutional\nprotections of citizens. This recognition has taken the form of the\ncivil rights law (let's just discuss the federal level for now), such\nas 18 USC 241 et. seq., 42 USC 1981 et. seq, et. al.\n   With this recognition of repression, at times manifested in the\nform of collective guilt, I want people to recognize denial. \nThough it can be said that white people numerically commit more\ncrimes in the United States, because white people are a majority,\nit can also be said that black people commit a disproportionate\namount of crime in the United States, in their relation to their\nnumbers in population.\n   My views are out of experiences when I was a police officer\nin a large metropolitan area, and of a citizen. Unless people\naccount for their behavior, and for the behavior of their immediate\ncommunity, nothing will improve.\n\nRegards,
SPEAKING OF VAT:  Did anyone see CNN's report yesterday (4/15)?  It \nwas quite hillarious (no pun intended).

When they got to the final \nstage (the actual retail sale) the small stack of quarters added to the\nlarge stack already there was said to be "the amount paid by consumers."\nIn other words, they completed ignored the fact that at each stage the\ntax would of course be passed on to the next buyer with the retail consumer\npaying the full load.\n\nThese are not journalists--they're lap dogs.

Just ask yourself these questions:\n\n1) Why would anyone borrow money from themselves at interest?\nThe Federal government does * NOT * * NOT *\nThe Federal reserve Bank is private.  The American people are\nbeing ripped off royally.  100% of the income tax goes to pay\non the Federal debt to the Federal Reserve Bankers.  Not one\ndime goes for services.  Services like the military and\nwelfare come from excise taxes and the like.\n\n2) Why do we the American people stand for this?????

THE WHITE HOUSE\n\n                    Office of the Press Secretary\n_____________________________________________________________________\nFor Immediate Release                                  April 14, 1993\n\n\n\n                            PRESS BRIEFING\n                       BY GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS\n\n\n                          The Briefing Room\n\n\n12:40 P.M. EDT\n	     \n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I guess I'm just prepared to take \nquestions today.\n	     \n	     Q	  George, Bob Dole says that the Clinton \nadministration's policy on Bosnia is a failure and that he wants the \nUnited States to take the lead in lifting the arms embargo so that \nthe Bosnian Muslims can defend themselves.\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  As you know, President Clinton has \nsaid that that suggestion is under active consideration.  Obviously, \nthis is a tragic situation in Bosnia.  And if the Bosnian Serbs don't \ncome to the negotiating table in a constructive way, we'll look \nseriously at pressing for lifting the arms embargo.  In the meantime, \nwe're going to continue to press for a tough sanctions resolution in \nthe U.N.  We're going to continue to work on the Serbs to come to the \nnegotiating table.  But the prospect of an arms embargo is something \nthe President certainly will consider if the Serbs don't come to the \ntable.\n	     \n	     Q	  How much longer are you going to give them to come \nto the table, George?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We're working on that right now.\n	     \n	     Q	  It's been a long time.\n	     \n	     Q	  On February 19th, the President mentioned the value \nadded tax in Ohio.  And when he was asked about it later by \nreporters, he said -- quote -- "That is a radical change in the tax \nsystem of the United States.  It's something I think we may have to \nlook at in the years ahead."  Questioned again about it later he \nsays, "It is not something that is now under consideration.  If we \nstart considering it, I'll tell you."  It wasn't a trial balloon or \nanything, he said.  I was just discussing the tax response to a \nquestion.  Donna Shalala, quoted in USA Today this morning -- quote -\n- "Certainly we're looking at a VAT."  What's gone on?\n	     \n	     Q	  The same with Alice Rivlin this morning.\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The health care task force is \nreviewing a number of options.  They haven't made any decisions yet.  \nAnd as I have said from this podium time and time again, we're not \ngoing to comment on decisions that haven't been made.\n	     \n	     Q	  But you have also said from this podium time and \ntime again --\n	     \n	     Q	  Wait a minute.  Whoa, Nelly.  Whoa.  \n	     \n	     Q	     that that was not under consideration.\n	     \n	     Q	  Yes.  Clinton says, "It is not something that is \nnow under consideration."  Is that no longer true?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I believe the working group, as Ms. \nShalala says, has looked at this prospect, but no decisions have been \nmade of any kind.\n	     \n	     Q	  Well, I know.  But he said he'd tell us about it if \nit was ever under consideration.  I take it that now he is and he \ndidn't tell us about it or --\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Did he say if it was under \nconsideration or if it was something to be proposed?\n	     \n	     Q	  "If we start considering I'll tell you."\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  If it's something to be proposed?\n	     \n	     Q	  "If we start considering it, I'll tell you."  \nThat's a direct quote.\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The task force has looked at a \nnumber of different options.  They have not made any decisions yet.  \nThe President has not made any decisions yet.  This is -- one of the \nproposals under consideration by the task force was to go out and \ncast as wide a net as possible for different ideas on how to reform \nthe health care system.  They have cast a very wide net.  They have \nlooked at hundreds of different proposals -- probably thousands of \ndifferent proposals.  But the President has not made any decisions.\n	     \n	     Q	  Well, is the President aware of their consideration \nof this option?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know if he's been briefed \non any preliminary conclusions or anything like that from the task \nforce on this specific proposal of any kind.  I don't know that \nthat's gotten to his level.  He started yesterday to go through with \nthe task force a very wide range of decisions and I don't believe \nthat that's been presented to him, no.\n	     \n	     Q	  Well, he's not relying on the USA Today to tell him \nwhat his task force is considering in the way of taxes.\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, he's going through it in a very \ndeliberate fashion.  There are a number of decisions that have to be \nmade.  I don't know that this proposal has reached that decision-\nmaking point.\n	     \n	     Q	  If this is still under consideration, that's a \nchange, at least from what we've been told by Dee Dee, I think about \nthree weeks ago or so.  She said, that is not an option, talking \nabout the -- had a big argument with somebody over this, so I \nremember it specifically -- and said it not once, but twice.  Is that \nnot the case?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I don't know if this has \nbeen presented to the President as something that is being looked at \nat some level in the task force.\n	     \n	     Q	  It was ruled it out, though.  I mean, unlike other \noptions that you've kept in the mix, this one specifically was ruled \nout.\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, this is something that is \nbeing looked at, but no decision has been made of any kind.  I mean, \nit doesn't -- it's not necessarily material until you get to the \ndecision-making phase.  The working groups are looking at hundreds of \ndifferent options.\n	     \n	     Q	  If it was ruled out before and it's not ruled out \nnow, then something has changed, George.  Yes, no?\n	     \n	     Q	  When a guy says in February --\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the working groups are \nlooking at the widest possible range of options.\n	     \n	     Q	  So something's changed.  They weren't looking at it \nbefore; they're looking at it now.\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I don't know if the working \ngroups have gotten to that point yet.  They are casting a very wide \nnet.\n	     \n	     Q	  How was it possible that you and Dee Dee were able \nto sell -- definitively rule it out as an option previously and now \nare saying that, in fact, it is being considered?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, the working groups are \nlooking at a wide range of options.  They have not --\n	     \n	     Q	  Do you deny that you and Dee Dee ruled it -- flatly \nruled it out on several occasions in the past month?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't deny that -- I mean, those \nare the President's words.  Those are very clear.\n	     \n	     Q	  Subsequent to the President's words, do you deny \nthat within the last month you and Dee Dee have both publicly ruled \nit out?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know about the timing.  I \nthink what we did was refer back to the President's words and say \nthey stand.\n	     \n	     Q	  So don't they stand any longer?\n	     \n	     Q	  March 25th, Clinton said for the next four to five \nyears it was ruled out.\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, those words -- the President \ndid say that in February.  The working groups are on a separate \ntrack, and as I said, I don't believe --\n	     \n	     Q	  Separate from the President?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't believe this has been \npresented to the President.\n	     \n	     Q	  Are they considering something that the President \n--\n	     \n	     Q	  Has ruled out?\n	     \n	     Q	     has ruled out?  I mean, will the President \nconsider a VAT tax?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, the working groups have not \npresented this to the President.  They have looked at a wide range of \noptions.  I suppose that if an argument is made, he will clearly \nlisten to it.  That does not mean he has decided to do it.\n	     \n	     Q	  Can we put this another way?  In his answer in \nOhio, he looked at the VAT in terms of restructuring the whole tax \nsystem.  Under those -- that was the circumstance that he said it \nmight be considered at some future point.  Is that no longer the \ncase, or is that the only way that he can see a VAT emerging?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I guess I'm not sure exactly what \nyou're asking.\n	     \n	     Q	  He talked about the VAT in the context of a \nrestructured tax system, not as a specific way to finance health \ncare, for example.\n	     \n	     Q	  Or anything else.\n	     \n	     Q	  Or anything else.\n	     \n	     Q	  It was always in the context of substituting for \nother taxes at a time of a dramatic overhaul of the whole tax system.\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Right.\n	     \n	     Q	  Has that change, too?\n	     \n	     Q	  Is that still his view?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I haven't spoken about those \nspecific comments.  I think -- I can just go back to it -- are the \nworking groups -- have they examined the possibility of a VAT?  Yes, \nthey have.\n	     \n	     Q	  Certainly we're looking at a VAT, she said.\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  They have examined the possibility \nof a VAT.  Has it been presented to the President?  Has he made a \ndecision?  No, he has not.\n	     \n	     Q	  What kind of a deal do you have when you've got the \nPresident's appointed task force, obviously not oblivious to his \nruling something out except in the context of some huge down the line \nreform, goes ahead on its own and considers a tax which he has \nspecifically ruled out in any context other than much later, and then \ngoes ahead and announces that that's what they're looking at?  Is the \nPresident concerned about that sort of thing?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think that the President's \nconcern is to make sure he gets the best health care proposal \npossible.  He's concerned with making sure that they have the most \nthorough process for examining all the possible alternatives, all the \ndifferent alternatives.  If a decision is made to go forward with \nsomething like that it's certainly something the President will \nexplain and justify.  But no decision has been made along those \nlines.\n	     \n	     Q	  What does it mean exactly, though, when the \nPresident rules something out?  Does it mean it can get back on the \ntable later if a more persuasive argument is made?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That's just -- that's indisputably \ntrue.  If you -- but, at the same time, he has not ruled it in.  He \nhas not made a proposal.\n	     \n	     Q	  What makes him open to it now when he wasn't open \nto it before?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He's certainly willing to listen to \nthe argument.\n	     \n	     Q	  Was he willing to listen to the argument for a \nshort-term tax this year, and he wasn't willing to listen to it in \nChilicothe?  He's now open to it --\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The context of his comments was \nthat it was not something -- he wanted to be clear that this is not \nsomething he was proposing, not something he was floating.\n	     \n	     Q	  Not something he was considering.  Those are his \nwords -- "It's not something that's now under consideration.  If we \nstart considering it, I'll tell you."  You're now acknowledging, are \nyou not, that it is under consideration and --\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm acknowledging that the task \nforce has studied this proposal.  I am also stating that the \nPresident has not made a decision on it.\n	     \n	     Q	  But the door is open for the President to \nreconsider including this as part of --\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Obviously, the working groups are \nlooking at it.  Again, but the President has not made a decision.\n	     \n	     Q	  Do you know if they will make a presentation on \nbehalf of the VAT to him?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know that.  I assume that \nif -- I don't know what stage they are it in proposing.  I don't know \nthat they're going to make the conclusion that this is something they \nshould present to him.  I know this is something the working groups \nare looking at.\n	     \n	     Q	  Do you understand, George, that none of us are \nasking these questions in context of a decision that the President \nhas made, only about what the President is considering?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I understand that, and I am \nacknowledging that the working groups have examined the issue of a \nVAT.\n	     \n	     Q	  And the President will consider it?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I assume that he will consider the \nargument if it is presented to him.\n	     \n	     Q	  Does that mean the President -- that working groups \nthink that when the President says no, he means maybe?  (Laughter.)\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think that means that the working \ngroups are trying to do the most thorough job possible.\n	     \n	     Q	  George, can I ask you another question about \nBosnia?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Sure.  (Laughter.)\n	     \n	     Q	  No, he wants us to stay on this.\n	     \n	     Q	  Let's do gays in the military.  (Laughter.)\n	     \n	     Q	  No, he got out of that swamp.\n	     \n	     Q	  I think we've gotten the bottom line on that VAT.  \nReggie Bartholomew, your Special Ambassador in Belgrade, today said \nthat if the Serbs do not accept the agreement that has been worked \nout -- quote -- "We will do our part to pursue the lifting of the \narms embargo together with our allies."  That seems to go a bit \nfurther than what you've just said --\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Sounds almost exactly what I just \nsaid.\n	     \n	     Q	  Well, do you accept -- in other words, you accept \nwhat Reggie --\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the President has said that \nthis is something that's under consideration.  It is something he \nwill consider if the current actions don't bring the Serbs to the \ntable.\n	     \n	     Q	  Isn't there some kind of timetable here?  \n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes, there is a timetable.  There's \ngoing to be a vote on the U.N. resolution in about 10 days.\n	     \n	     Q	  That's on sanctions, that's on tightening the \nsanctions.\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That's right, that's sanctions.  \nAnd we believe that that will ratchet up the pressure, and we hope \nthat that will bring the Serbs to the table.  As you know, Mr. \nBartholomew also met with Mr. Churkin of Russia, and they are also \nworking on ways to bring the Serbs to the table.  We will continue to \npressure them in many different ways and this is one possible option \nas well.\n	     \n	     Q	  The question is whether there's a timetable for \nconsideration or a vote on a decision on lifting the arms embargo, \nnot the sanctions.\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The next vote in the U.N. is on \nsanctions.  As far as I know, there are no votes scheduled on lifting \nthe arms embargo.  But it is something that we have discussed both \ninternally and with our allies.\n	     \n	     Q	  Why did Reggie Bartholomew tell the Serbs that the \nU.S. would do that?  What was the point of his telling them that?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, clearly, I mean, this is \nsomething that's under consideration, and this is something that we \ntake quite seriously if they do not come to the table.  They should \nknow the consequences of failing to come to the table.\n	     \n	     Q	  Have they been given a deadline?\n	     \n	     Q	  Warren Christopher has been saying the same thing \nand it hasn't seemed to change the Serbs' behavior in the least.  Why \nshould the Serbs take any heed of a threat to lift the arms embargo \nwhen so far everything that's been done has had no effect on the \nfighting in Bosnia?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I just don't accept the premise of \nyour question.  It has had an effect; the embargo is having an \neffect.  \n	     \n	     Q	  What effect?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  If the Serbians choose not to heed \nour warnings, then they will face the consequences.\n	     \n	     Q	  What effect has it had in Bosnia?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the effect that it has had on \nthe Serbians, it has tightened up -- they are not getting their \nshipments through.  We can brief more fully --\n	     \n	     Q	  In Bosnia, George.  In Bosnia what effect has it \nhad?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, it's hard to say if it's \nstopped the aggression to date.  That is why we're continuing to \npress for the Serbians to stop.  But we believe that over time we \nwill continue to weaken the Serbs and that will have   an effect.  \nI'm not saying it's going to happen overnight; it clearly hasn't \nhappened overnight.  But we believe that over time the sanctions can \nweaken the Serbs.  If it fails to work and if the Serbs fail to come \nto the negotiating table, we'll move forward with the embargo.\n	     \n	     Q	  Isn't there a working deadline, George, of the 24th \n-- the same date as the U.N. -- the scheduled U.N. vote?  Hasn't the \nUnited States said, along with many of the other NATO allies, that if \nthe Serbs aren't willing to sign on to the peace accord by then, that \nwe'll seek -- haven't we said that we will seek --\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We've said continually we're going \nto --\n	     \n	     Q	  But on that deadline?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't have a specific date, but \nwe're going to move forward with the resolution, the U.N. resolution, \nby around that time.  And if that fails to take effect, if that fails \nto bring the Serbs to the table, we will clearly consider other \nactions.\n	     \n	     Q	  Isn't this awfully incremental?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We're taking a step-by-step \napproach.  We're ratcheting up the pressure and we're going to \ncontinue to do that.\n	     \n	     Q	  Is there a possibility, George, that by the time \nall these incremental steps are taken the Serbs will have achieved \ntheir goals and then what's the purpose?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think the purpose is to get the \nSerbs to stop the aggression.  We are pursuing that goal on many \ndifferent fronts.  We are pursuing it through the U.N.; we're \npursuing it through direct talks; we are pursuing it through \ntightening the sanctions.  And we will consider lifting the arms \nembargo.  We are turning the screws up on the Serbs and we will \ncontinue to do that.\n	     \n	     Q	  But if the efforts have been unsuccessful in \ngetting the Serbs to stop the aggression how effective will any \ncampaign be to have the Serbs give back what they've gained?  I mean, \nonce they're entrenched --\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I can't speculate on that.  We're \ngoing to continue to press for them to come to the table now.  We're \ngoing to continue to find ways to stop the aggression.  But I can't \nsee into the future.\n	     \n	     Q	  George, on the stimulus package, House Republicans \nsay they're going to hold a series of town meetings on Saturday to \ntry and explain the details of your package.  They cite polls which \nshow that the more people learn about it, the less they like it.  \nWhat's your strategy to counter that?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The strategy we have is the one \nwe're going to continue.  As you saw, the President today pointed up \nthe very real benefits of the summer jobs program that this package \nwill provide:  700,000 new summer jobs this summer for kids in inner \ncities and suburbs to do productive work.  We are also going to point \nout the benefits of the highway money, the investments in highways.  \nWe're going to point up the benefits of immunization.  We're going to \npoint up the benefits of Head Start.  We are going to say that the \nRepublicans have a choice:  they can take action to create jobs or \nthey can perpetuate the gridlock of the last four years. \n	     \n	     Q	  Does it concern you, though, that the House now, \nthe House Republicans are after you as well as the Senate?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The House Republicans voted against \nit before.  They made a mistake then; they're making a mistake now.\n	     \n	     Q	  George, does it strike anybody in the \nadministration that it's a bit strong to describe, as the President \ndid this morning, the summer jobs program as -- quote -- "a \nreaffirmation of a promise of America"?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not at all.  I think it's the \npromise of America to give kids a chance to reach their full \npotential. \n	     \n	     Q	  Government-funded jobs?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  To give people a chance to work?  \nAbsolutely.  That is the promise of America.\n	     \n	     Q	  I want to follow up on something I asked yesterday \n-- where does 700,000 summer jobs, where does that figure come from?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That is on top of.  I did look at \nit.  There are currently 600,000 summer jobs in the pipeline.  This \nwill be on top of the 600,000, so it will be a total of 1.3 million.\n	     \n	     Q	  The 700,000 would be created by the stimulus \npackage?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.\n	     \n	     Q	  Where does that number come from?  Because we've \nbeen told all along that the stimulus package would create 500,000 \nnew jobs.  And according to Panetta, that breaks down to something \nlike 200,000 full-time jobs and 150,000 summer jobs.\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes, but the summer -- that's when \nyou do their full-time equivalence.  I mean, 700,000 individuals will \nreceive jobs this summer.  When you calculate it for the full-time \njob effect, you have to do -- I don't know what the exact formula is.\n	     \n	     Q	  Seven hundred thousand part-time jobs --\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  -- 150,000 or --\n	     \n	     Q	  One to four because it's three months.\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Thank you.\n	     \n	     Q	  Can I follow up on that?  Did the President \nmisspeak this morning when he said that some of the government money \nfor these summer jobs will pay for private -- for kids to work in the \nprivate sector?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not necessarily.  I mean, I think \nthat there will be grants available.  That's one of the ways that you \npay for the jobs.  At the same time, he's also issued a challenge to \nthe private sector to hire kids on their own as well.  \n	     \n	     Q	  Tax dollars, for instance, would pay for kids to \nwork at Time-Warner?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think the Time-Warner is actually \nsomebody coming forward and actually doing a grant.  That's going to \nbe the bulk of it.  There could be isolated instances, though, where \nthere would be grants to businesses.\n	     \n	     Q	  Has the President spoken with any Senate \nRepublicans this week?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  \nNo, but there's been a lot of contact with Senate Republicans in the \nWhite House.\n	     \n	     Q	  At a lower level.  But the President hasn't?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President has not, no.\n	     \n	     Q	  Getting any closer to get the votes?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We're continuing to work on it. \n	     \n	     Q	  Anybody leaning your way?\n	     \n	     Q	  On Haiti, The New York Times seems to be reporting \nsomething of a breakthrough in Aristide's attitude towards the coup \nleaders.  Can you confirm that there has been this change, and what \nimpact will it have on the process?  And what did Pezzullo have to \nsay yesterday in his report?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Pezzullo did brief the principals.  \nI can't confirm what's actually happening in the talks.  I would \nleave that to the negotiators themselves.  But Mr. Caputo has \nreturned to Haiti.  We have received a briefing here at the White \nHouse from Ambassador Pezzullo.  And as we have said time and time \nagain, we believe that assurances of security are important to a \nfinal resolution to a broader political settlement.\n	     \n	     Q	  George, yesterday you offered some selective \nbreakdowns of how the stimulus would impact some states and cities.  \nCan we get a complete breakdown by state of how these jobs would be \nimpacted?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think we have it for most states, \nyes.  And I think we can get it out.\n	     \n	     Q	  Could you make that generally available?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I believe we can.\n	     \n	     Q	  And could you do it by the component of the \nstimulus?  In other words --\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know if we can do -- I know \nthat we can do it by summer jobs and other jobs.  I don't know how \ndeeply it can be broken down.  But clearly, we can break it down into \nsummer jobs and other jobs.\n	     \n	     Q	  And can I follow up?  Is this the information that \nJeff Eller and the rest of the White House is using in the ads in the \nstates?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know if they're ads, but \nthey're press releases.\n	     \n	     Q	  Can you describe what those press releases contain?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  All we're doing is pointing out the \nbenefits of this package to various states.  For instance, I know \nthat today Senator Dole is heading up to Vermont and New Hampshire.  \nAnd I would point out that the stimulus package, the jobs package \ncreates 1,000 jobs in Vermont.  It creates 2,000 jobs in New \nHampshire.  And the people of those states should remind him that \nthis is important. \n	     \n	     Q	  Where are the releases going?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  They go to the states.\n	     \n	     Q	  To whom?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We can get them.  It's no problem.\n	     \n	     Q	  Can we get it?\n	     \n	     Q	  Why don't you put them out here as well?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think we can.\n	     \n	     Q	  This afternoon?  Would that be possible?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'll have to check.  I don't know.  \nBut as soon as we can.\n	     \n	     Q	  Are you focusing these press releases on states \nwhere there are moderate or pragmatic Republican senators?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think we're trying to get as many \nas we can.  It's actually quite difficult to pull this together and \nwe're doing our best.  We're putting them out as we get them.\n	     \n	     Q	  Why are you so closely tracking Senator Dole's \nschedule?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I was just following it. \n	     \n	     Q	  Are press releases going along to states where he's \nvisiting?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm not sure.  I think that \nprobably there are press releases going to Vermont.  (Laughter.)\n	     \n	     Q	  Will there be a man in a chicken suit waiting?  \n(Laughter.)\n	     \n	     Q	  George, as the President goes about the business of \ndefending what's in his stimulus package, he doesn't address what \nseems to be the Republicans' main point, that you're funding it with \ndeficit spending rather than "if it's so important, why not come up \nwith the funding for it" seems to be the Republican argument.  And \nhow do you answer that?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  What was answer is, we are paying \nfor it over time.  And if you look at our budget, we pay for this \npackage over time.  We believe right now the economy needs a jump-\nstart for jobs.\n	     \n	     Q	  You're not claiming, are you, that that doesn't add \nto the deficit this year?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm saying we're paying for it over \ntime.  I didn't say that.\n	     \n	     Q	  I know that, George.  But I mean, from the \nbeginning, the question -- we do have annual budgets and things --\ndeficit spending will pay for that this year, will it not?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  This year they clearly will.  But \nover time our budget fully pays for this program.\n	     \n	     Q	  What you're saying is that there are savings that \nwould cover this if it were this year in future years?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Absolutely.  That's exactly what I \nsaid.\n	     \n	     Q	  I know that, but there is going to be outstanding \ndebt, it will add to the national debt from this year --\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, we're reducing the deficit by \n$500 billion -- $514 billion over the next four years.\n	     \n	     Q	  You mean you're reducing it below what it would \nhave been?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Exactly.\n	     \n	     Q	  In fact, you're adding a very large amount to the \nnational debt over the period of --\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  But we're reducing it far more from \nwhat it would have been.  That's true.  \n	     \n	     Q	  Washington-type reduction.  (Laughter.)\n	     \n	     Q	  You're getting to be a grumpy old man.\n	     \n	     Q	  George, has any decision been made about the White \nHouse or the President's participation in the gay rights march coming \nup in a week and a half?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We're working on the President's \nschedule now.  I believe he's going to be at the Senate Democratic \nretreat in Jamestown that weekend.\n	     \n	     Q	  Will he address it by phone?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know about that.  It's a \nlittle far out, but I believe he's going to be in the Senate retreat.\n	     \n	     Q	  So will he have the leaders in a day or two before \nthe speech?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know.  I would expect that \nat some point he would meet with the leaders of some of these groups.  \nI don't know the schedule on it, though.\n	     \n	     Q	  Will there be an AIDS czar appointed prior to or in \nconjunction with the event?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm just not sure.\n	     \n	     Q	  April 22nd is Earth Day.  What is the President \ngoing to do to mark that, and is it the case that he is going to sign \nthe biodiversity treaty that day?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I know there's been some work on \nthe biodiversity treaty.  I don't know about signing it that day, but \nI would expect he'll have a statement on Earth Day or right around \nthen.\n	     \n	     Q	  Where is the work on the biodiversity treaty?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'd have to check with Katie \nMcGinty.  I just know that there's been some work done, but I don't \nknow exactly what.\n	     \n	     Q	  When is Earth Day?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The 22nd, I think.\n	     \n	     Q	  Why is it you know that he is going to have a \nstatement on Earth Day but you don't know if he's going to have a \nstatement on the gay rights march?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I said I don't know if he's going \nto meet or when he's going to meet.\n	     \n	     Q	  Do you have a statement on the gay rights march?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't, actually, no.  I wouldn't \nbe surprised if he did, though.\n	     \n	     Q	  Do you have some details on the Miyazawa visit?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's a working visit on Friday and \nthe President is looking forward to that in discussing a number of \nissues including Russian aid and the Japanese stimulus package and \nthe trade issues between the two countries.\n	     \n	     Q	  There was some expectations that a second aid \npackage to Russia was going to be unveiled at the G-7 meeting and, if \nI understand, it hasn't happened.  Why is that or what's the status \non that?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The G-7 meeting is still going on \nand, as you know, Secretaries Bentsen and Christopher have talked \nabout the outlines of a possible package.  But we're going to \ncontinue to consult with Congress and our G-7 allies on that.\n	     \n	     Q?	    We will not then make any kind of announcement \nduring the two-day meeting?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The meeting's not over yet.  \n	     \n	     Q	  Is that when you're going to make one?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm not ruling out the possibility.\n	     \n	     Q	     the President's going to announce it tomorrow.\n	     \n	     Q	  Bentsen said that.\n	     \n	     Q	  Yes, Bentsen said it would be tomorrow.\n	     \n	     Q	  So did Christopher.\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'd have to look at that, but I \nbelieve it is more likely that the announcement will come out of \nTokyo.\n	     \n	     Q	  George, has there been further consideration here \nabout going to -- sending the President out to Los Angeles?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know that there's -- it's \nnot something we've ruled out.  We don't have a date set for it.\n	     \n	     Q	  George, you all have a position or do you support \nImmigration's plan to settle 4,000 Iraqi prisoners in the United \nStates?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's the first I've heard of it.\n	     \n	     Q	  George, there was a report today about the --\n	     \n	     Q	  Fortunately.  (Laughter.) \n	     \n	     Q	     about the pace of appointments and says that \nPresident Clinton is behind President Bush in the number of positions \nthat people have been nominated for.  Are you going to speed up the \npace of nominations or where do you stand with it?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We filled 814 of the President's \nappointments.  And it's broken down -- we have 384 Schedule C; 147 \nnoncareer SES; 213 PAS full-time.  I'm not sure what that means --\n(laughter) -- 70 PA full-time.  And this is about the same -- it's \nabout the same pace of President Bush.  Obviously, as you move along \nfarther, once you -- each level of appointment actually has a \nmultiplier effect and frees up far more appointments.  So we expect \nthe process to speed up.  But we're at the pace of Bush.  Obviously \nwe'd like to get these done as quickly as possible.  \n	     \n	     I would point out that the FBI background checks and the \nbackground check is far more comprehensive and it takes more time \nthan our predecessors, and that is part of the holdup.  But we're \nworking on it.\n	     \n	     Q	  Is that because of Nannygate?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think that's an awful big part of \nit, yes.\n	     \n	     Q	  In the story this morning, you were at \napproximately the same pace as Bush in making appointments, but way \nbehind in winning confirmations.\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That's where the background checks \ncomes into play.  That's the problem.\n	     \n	     Q	  That's the background checks problem?  Because I \nmean, you have a Democratic Senate --\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, that's not the -- you make the \nappointments, and then it takes quite a bit of time to fill out all \nthe forms and have the background checks done.  That's exactly where \nthe problem is.\n	     \n	     Q	  What's the President doing this afternoon, and \nwhat's on the plan for tomorrow?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He's got some meetings -- just \noffice meetings this afternoon for the most part, on a variety of \nissues that -- probably a half-dozen different issues.  And then \nhe'll be -- tomorrow we'll have an event, probably again focused on \nthe stimulus and jobs package out of here at the White House.  And \nFriday is the Miyazawa meeting.\n	     \n	     Q	  Will you be releasing his tax return tomorrow, \nGeorge?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Either tomorrow or Friday.\n	     \n	     Q	  Is there going to be a pre-briefing regarding the \nJapanese Prime Minister's visit tomorrow?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know about tomorrow, but \nwe'll probably get something done, as we usually do, for these \nvisits.\n	     \n	     Q	  Was Reverend Jackson here this morning and do you \nknow what that was about?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He was here.  He met with a group \nof us here at the White House, including Mack McLarty.\n	     \n	     Q	  Who?\n	     \n	     Q	  Reverend Jackson.\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Reverend Jackson.  Mack McLarty, \nme, Gene Sperling, Bruce Reed, Jeff Watson, Mark Gearan. \n	     \n	     Q	  Talking about Haiti?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We talked about general urban \npolicy.  He is about to go to Los Angeles.  He was just back from \nMississippi, where we had a good victory last night; and he's going \non to Los Angeles.\n	     \n	     Q	  Did he request the meeting?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Actually, no.  He's in continual \ncontact with the President.  He had written a letter on a variety of \nissues, and so we asked him to come in and talk about it.\n	     \n	     Q	  George, Dole is having a fundraiser for Jeffords \ntonight in Vermont.  Have you guys been  in contact with Jeffords at \nall on this?\n\n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think there's been some contact, \nsure.\n	     \n	     Q	  Can you tell us about the contacts?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm not sure -- \n	     \n	     Q	  Do you know who contacted him or what was said?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I know that Howard Paster talked to \nhim and they just has a general talk about the package.\n	     \n	     Q	  And did he express his support for it now, or is he \n--\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I can't divulge the details of the \nconversation, but there have been conversations.\n	     \n	     Q	  The L.A. Times is reporting that abortion --\nelective abortions is likely to be included in the basic health care \npackage.  Is this something the President is considering?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again --\n	     \n	     Q	  Along with the VAT?  (Laughter.)\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's certainly something that's \nbeen looked at, but no decisions have been made.\n	     \n	     Q	  What was the question?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The L.A. Times story on whether \nabortions will be covered by the President's health plan.\n	     \n	     Q	  Did the President in his meeting -- did you in your \nmeeting with Reverend Jackson ask his advice, solicit his advice \nabout what kind of stance the White House should take in the wake of \nthe verdict in L.A.?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, we certainly talked about the \nsituation in Los Angeles and the long-term prospects for economic \ndevelopment and other issues.\n	     \n	     Q	  For instance, did you discuss whether it would be \nhelpful for the President to go there or not?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, we discussed a wide range of \nissues related to Los Angeles.  That was certainly one of them.\n	     \n	     Q	  Letting you perhaps go out on the way you came in, \nI need to go back to Bosnia just for a second and ask --\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Oh, good.\n	     \n	     Q	     your reaction to Margaret Thatcher's comments \nthat you're just sitting by and watching a massacre.\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, we've been pushing very hard \non a number of fronts for more aggressive action.  We will continue \nto do that.\n	     \n	     Q	  Can you tell us if you've made any progress in your \ntalks on the stimulus package getting a compromise?  I mean, we don't \nhave any feel except talks are ongoing.  Have you talked to like 20 \npeople or --\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know the numbers.  We've \ntalked to several people and we've had wide-ranging sessions.  \n	     \n	     Q	  Anyone leaning your way?\n	     \n	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I can't get into that.  We're just \ngoing to keep working through Tuesday.\n	     \n	     THE PRESS:  Thank you.\n\n                                 END                    1:10 P.M. EDT
THE WHITE HOUSE\n\n                  Office of the Press Secretary\n                 (Vancouver, British Columbia) \n______________________________________________________________\n\n\n                       BACKGROUND BRIEFING\n                               BY\n                 SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS\n\n\n                          April 4, 1993\n	     \n                          Canada Place\n                  Vancouver, British Columbia  \n\n\n9:40 A.M. PST\n	     \n	     \n	     Folks, we're about to start the BACKGROUND BRIEFING \non the aid package.\n\n	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Good morning.  The \nPresident -- President Clinton and President Yeltsin agreed \nyesterday on a series of American initiatives to support economic \nand political reform in Russia, and it's valued at $1.6 billion.  \n\n	     Before taking your questions and running through the \nbasic outlines of this package, I want to make a few points.  \nFirst, this is the maximum that the Clinton administration can do \nwith available funds to support Russian reform.  All of the funds \nhave been allocated and appropriated by the Congress.  There is \nno need for the administration to go back to the Congress to fund \nany of these programs.  All our Fiscal Year '93 funds currently \nare available, so in effect, all of these programs can begin \ntomorrow.\n	     \n	     The second point is that this package is designed to \nsupport Russian reformers.  All of the initiatives in the package \nare directed at reformers and for their benefit, and all have \nbeen worked out with prior consultation with the Russian \ngovernment.\n	     \n	     Third, the President is determined that we will \ndeliver on these commitments this year.  The package is designed \nto maximize our ability to support reform.  In designing it we \nwanted to avoid making commitments that we could not meet, and we \nfeel very confident that we can meet all of these commitments in \nfront of you.\n	     \n	     Fourth, I'd like to note the special importance of \ntrade and investment.  I think it's fair to say that Russia's \ncapital and technology needs throughout the next decade extend \nwell into the hundreds of billions of dollars.  No collection of \ngovernments can meet those needs; only the private sector can do \nso.  And so the President and President Yeltsin agreed to make \ntrade and investment a major priority in the relationship.  \n	     \n	     They also agreed that there would be a new joint \ncommission on energy and space formed, headed on the U.S. side by \nVice President Gore; on the Russian side by Prime Minister \nChernomyrdin.  And the goal of this effort is to break through \nthe barriers to trade and investment on both sides and to promote \na vastly expanded relationship.\n	     \n	     If it would be helpful I'd be prepared to run down \nthe first page, which is a summary of U.S. assistance, and just \ngive you some general background on what these programs are.  \nI'll do it quickly and then I'll be glad to take questions.\n	     \n	     The first group of initiatives are humanitarian food \nand medical assistance.  This is part of our effort which has \nbeen underway for several years to provide basic humanitarian \ngrant food assistance so that the Russian government can assure \nthere's at least a minimal amount of bread on the shelves in the \nmajor cities.  That's $194 million in grant -- that is from Food \nfor Progress, the grant portion of Food for Progress.  We'll also \nbe continuing our grant assistance in medicines and \npharmaceutical supplies, and that's $30 million.\n	     \n	     The second item is concessional food sales.  As you \nknow, the United States has had a long-term grain relationship \nwith Russia.  It's important to us and it's important to Russia \nthat we continue that relationship.  The President has chosen the \nFood for Progress program which is a concessional loan program.  \nThe value over the next seven months is $700 million.  These are \nconcessional terms.  The exact terms have not been worked out, \nbut I think it's fair to say there will be a grace period on \nprincipal of six or seven years, and concessional rates \nthereafter for the life of the deal.\n	     \n	     The third program is a collection of private sector \nsupport.  We think this is one of the most important things we're \ngoing to do.  Privatization and the creation of small businesses \nis the number one priority of the reform government in Moscow.  \nAnd so the President has decided to create a Russian-American \nenterprise fund capitalized this year at $50 million.  And the \ngoal of this fund is to make direct loans to small businesses in \nRussia, to take equity positions in those businesses.  \n	     \n	     The President has also decided to create a \nprivatization fund which would work directly with the Russian \ngovernment in its priority objective of trying to convert state \nenterprises from a state-owned basis to a private basis.  He has \nalso agreed -- the President has also agreed to establish a \nEurasia foundation.  This would be a private foundation led by \nprominent Americans to fund democratization projects in Russia.\n	     \n	     The fourth grouping you see there in the summary \npage is democratization itself.  I think it's fair to say that \nthis administration has given a new impetus to the goal of \npursuing democratization in Russia.  You see that we have a total \nof $48 million in programs, various programs.  The detailed \ntables give an indication of some of the programs that we're \nlaunching.  \n	     \n	     The President is also calling for the development of \na democracy corps, which will be an overarching umbrella group to \ntry to incorporate all of the disparate private and public \nefforts now underway from the United States to support reform in \nRussia.\n	     \n	     The fifth program you see is Russian office of \nresettlement.  This is a new initiative created and \nconceptualized by this administration.  This is a demonstration \nproject.  What we'd like to do is work with the Russian military \nto help resettle Russian officers returning from the Baltic \nstates and other parts of the former Soviet Union.  We want to \nmake sure that we work out the best way to do that, whether it's \nwith Russian labor and Russian materials or using prefab American \nconstruction.  And so we've decided to fund on a demonstration \nbasis the construction of 450 housing units.  We'll be working \nvery closely with the Russian military on this.  And I would say \nthat we have a long-term commitment to this project.  \n	     \n	     The sixth area is energy in the environment.  They \nare two issues that the President feels strongly about.  Our \ninitial efforts will be feasibility studies to look into the \npossibility of enhancing their energy production, both oil and \ngas; and equally important trying to cut down on the leakages in \nthe oil and gas pipeline systems, which cause so much \nenvironmental damage.\n	     \n	     I've talked a little bit about trade and investment, \nabout the new group being created that the Vice President will \nchair on our side.  Secretary Ron Brown will also be cochairing \nwith Deputy Prime Minister Shohkin, a business development \ncommittee, which will work in all other sectors of the economy, \nto break down the many barriers that currently exist and impede \ntrade and investment.  We are also going to appoint a full-time \ninvestment ombudsman in the American government to work on this \nproblem full-time.  \n	     \n	     And the point I'd like to make here is, trade and \ninvestment in the 1990s is every bit as important, to draw an \nanalogy, as arms reductions was in the '70s and '80s.  And we \njust thought that in looking at this we needed to make a \ncommitment within our own government to have people work on it -- \nsenior people on a full-time basis, because it is terribly \nimportant.\n	     \n	     You'll notice that the United States is going to \nsupport Russia's membership in the GATT.  Russia has had observer \nstatus.  Russia has requested our support and, in fact, requested \nour advice in becoming a member of the GATT.  We think that the \nlong-term goal of drawing Russia into the global economy is \nparamount, a very important goal.  And that is why we are \nsupporting the membership in the GATT.  We are also supporting \ntheir access to GSP, the Generalized System of Preferences.  \n	     \n	     You'll note that Ex-Im has extended $82 million in \ncredit for a caterpillar deal in Siberia, that OPIC has extended \n$150 million in credits and loan guarantees for a Conoco oil \nproject.  I'd like to emphasize that we are very close to an \nagreement between Russia and the United States for a $2-billion \nframework facility through the Ex-Im Bank that would finance \nRussian purchases of American oil and gas equipment and services. \nWe think this is a very important development.  We think we'll \nget there by April 14th, which is the opening day of the Tokyo \nconference, the G-7 conference.\n	     \n	     Before I take any further questions, I'd like to \ndefer to my colleague, who will review the security assistance \nobjectives with you.\n	     \n	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Our major \nunfinished agenda with the Russians and with their counterparts \nin Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Belarus is in the area of the safe and \nsecure dismantlement of the nuclear arsenals on their territory \nunder the terms of the START I and START II agreements.   \nRecently we completed in Moscow three, I think, very important \nagreements that devote a significant chunk of Nunn-Lugar funding \nto three important programs.  The first is the program of $130 \nmillion for the strategic nuclear delivery vehicle dismantlement \nprogram.  That is for submarines, for ICBM dismantlement and for \nbomber dismantlement -- $130 million.\n	     \n	     The second is a $75 million tranche of funding for \nthe construction of a facility to store nuclear materials removed \nfrom the warheads as they are dismantled.  This will essentially \ncontribute to the overall design and the early phases of the \nconstruction of that storage facility.  \n	     \n	     And finally, a $10-million tranche of money to help \nin the establishment of a monitoring system for the nuclear \nmaterials as they are withdrawn from the weapons system.  So we \nadd that $215-million total to the extant Nunn-Lugar assistance \nwhich has been flowing -- about $150 million for some overall \nsafety improvements for various kinds of equipment and safety \nmeasures that we have been working out with the Russians over the \nlast couple of years.  \n	     \n	     So this is an area where we will be going a lot more \nwork with not only the Russians but with the Ukrainians, Kazhaks, \nand Belarussians.  Belarus, for example, has just, in the last \ncouple of weeks, received up to $65 million in FY'93 funds for \nsafety, security and dismantlement programs on Belarussian \nterritory.  And this was in the wake of their ratification of \nSTART I, an agreement to accede to NPT. \n	     \n	     So we are working very hard with all the parties to \nthe Lisbon protocols, and will continue to work very hard with \nthem.  And I look upon these three recent agreements with Russia \nas a very important step in that process.\n	     \n	     Q	  The OPIC funds to -- is that for the field in \nKazhakstan -- and Conoco already signed this deal with \nKazhakstan.  Why do you feel now it is necessary -- if it's the \nsame one, why do you feel it's necessary?\n	     \n	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  It's not the same \ndeal.  Chevron signed a deal with Kazhakstan, the Tenges oil \nfield.  This is a new investment project.  It's a polar lights \noil development and renovation project, and it's being announced \ntoday.  So it's completely new.\n	     \n	     Q	  Can you tell us more about what's involved?\n	     \n	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Yes.  Conoco, like \nother American oil companies has been searching for ways to do \ntwo things.  One, to prospect for new oil in Siberia, west \nSiberia; and two, to try to get into the business of renovating \noil wells and renovating pipelines, both oil and gas, in Russia.  \nThe objective here, obviously, is to take advantage of the \nnatural resources in Russia, increase energy production, which \nwill, in turn, increase hard currency revenues, which is what \nRussia needs.\n	     \n	     So we think this deal is very, very good development \nfor Russia.  The Russians do as well, and it's good for an \nAmerican company.  And the American government has played a \nleading role in pulling this together through the credit facility \nin OPIC and through the loan guarantee.\n	     \n	     Q	  So it's to search and also to renovate fields \nthat are already there?\n	     \n	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  That's right.\n	     \n	     Q	  On that point, should other American companies \nexpect to get administration support for such deals, or should \nthey now go to the Ex-Im and try to get the money out of the $2 \nbillion?\n	     \n	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, as you know, \nEx-Im is part of the U.S. government and various parts of the \nU.S. government have been pushing, including the State Department \nand the White House for this deal to be consummated.  And we \nthink it will.  And if we arrive at this agreement by April 14th, \nthere will be $2 billion in financing available for American \ncompanies to sell their equipment and sell their services.\n	     \n	     Q	  That should take up all of the rest of the \ndeals and their won't be -- and their will or there won't be \nsupport for OPIC sort of deals such as this Conoco?\n	     \n	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  There's a \ntremendous amount of interest on the part of American oil and gas \ncompanies to invest in Russia.  We think that the Ex-Im oil and \ngas facility, the $2-billion facility, once it is concluded, will \nsoak up a lot of that interest.  But I think the interest may \neven extend beyond that.  And if so, the government will respond.\n	     \n	     Q	  What's the current year budget costs of that \n$2-billion agreement should it go forward?  And is there any \ncurrent year budget costs --\n	     \n	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I'll have to refer \nyou to Ex-Im for that.  I don't know the details of that.\n	     \n	     Q	  The concessional food sales -- is there any \ncurrent year costs to that, or is it delayed until the years in \nwhich the payments are due?\n	     \n	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  The concessional \nfood sales are from Food for Progress, which is a USDA program.  \nUSDA has the funds, we don't need to go back to the Congress to \nexpend those funds.  There will be a hit in the budget.  I'd \nrefer you to USDA and OMB for the details on that.\n	     \n	     Q	  Can you talk about the Democracy Corps?\n	     \n	     Q	     and the private sector -- how many folks are \ngoing to be involved in that?\n	     \n	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Why don't I start \nwith the Democracy Corps first.  I think the administration felt \ncoming into office that there were literally thousands of \norganization, private organizations in the United States that in \none way or another were working at the goal of trying to achieve \ndemocratization in Russia, helping on a farmer-to-farmer basis.  \nAnd there were literally 10 or 15 U.S. government agencies that \nhad a variety of programs in this area.  And so the \nadministration felt -- the President felt it was important to try \nto draw all of these initiatives together under one group to give \nsome coherence to the efforts and to give some impetus to the \nefforts.  And so this is a presidential initiative.\n	     \n	     It will be headed by Ambassador Tom Simons who will \nsoon take up his duties as the coordinator for U.S. assistance in \nthe former Soviet Union.  And we're very hopeful that we might \nuse this Democracy Corps not only to draw upon the resources of \nour own government, but the resources of the American private \nsector and schools and communities across the nation.\n	     \n	     Q	     any kind of commitment yet, any kind of word \nyet on FY'94, and any new money that needs to be appropriated \nbesides the $300 million the President talked about?\n	     \n	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  The administration \nis requesting additional funds in FY'94 of $700 million.  What \nthe President has done this weekend is to consult really \nintensively yesterday with President Yeltsin about additional \nmeasures the United States could take in some of these areas to \nsupport reform.  He'll be consulting with the Congress.  When he \nreturns to Washington, he'll be consulting also with the other \nally governments, and we'll make a decision at that time.\n	     \n	     Q	  Two questions about the $700 billion \nagricultural money.  First of all, I thought it was the sort of \nconsensus that what Russia did not need was more loans for food.  \nSo why did you decide to do it that way?  Secondly, could you \nexplain -- agriculture has been stopped from making further loans \nfor food because of Russia's inability to pay.  How does this fit \ninto that situation?\n	     \n	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  As you know, the \nUnited States for a long time has been a major supplier of grains \nand food commodities, agricultural products to Russia.  I think \nbetween 1991 and '92 we had extended -- a little bit of history \nhere -- about $5.5 billion in credits, credit guarantees, through \nthe Commodity Credit Corporation.  That was the principal vehicle \nto ensure the sale of American grain products.  On December 1 of \nlast year, '92, the Russian government stopped its payments on \nthat program.  They are now in arrears to us on that program, and \ntherefore, by law, the United States cannot continue that \nprogram.  And so the President, working with Secretary Espy and \nother officials in the Cabinet, looked for other ways that we \ncould promote American grain sales.  \n	     \n	     And I think we have two ways to do that.  We've \nannounced today $194 million in grant food assistance through the \nFood for Progress program.  But we do not have sufficient \nauthority to spend $700 million in grant food, and so we looked \nfor a concessional loan program.  \n	     \n	     I think everybody agrees that Russia -- that a \nshort-term loan program for Russia would not make sense now, but \na long-term concessional loan program would.  And that is what \nthis program is.  It will provide, once the final details are \nworked out, for a six to seven-year grace period on payments of \nprincipal.  And then from years seven through 15, which is the \nlife of the deal, it will provide for concessional rates of \ninterest -- generally around three to four percent.  And so we \nbelieve and the Russian government believes this is a good deal \nfor them because it will avoid the imperative of early payments \nand put them into the out years, but it will also continue this \nvery important grain relationship, which is important for them, \nand it's important for the American farm community.\n	     \n	     Q	  I gather from what you say that this could make \nit explicit -- the Russians' failure to pay the interest on ECC \nloan does not in any way affect this kind of loan going through, \nis that right? \n	     \n	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Let me be explicit \nabout that.  We are prevented under the law to from continuing  \nthe Commodity Credit Corporation short-term credit program \nbecause of Russia's arrearages to the United States.  All of you \nknow about those arrearages.  They total about, I think, around \n$640 million.  USDA can give you an exact figure.  So having \ntaken that into consideration and wanting to preserve American \nmarket share and a long-term grain relationship, wanting to \nrespond to a specific request from the Russian government for \nmajor food assistance, knowing that we couldn't take it from the \ngrant programs because we don't have sufficient authority there, \nwe looked at Food for Progress, which is a program we've used to \ngreat effect in other parts of the world.  And we consulted with \nthe Russian government and arrived at this solution.  \n	     \n	     I think the Russians are pleased because it provides \nthem with the food, but also gives them a little bit of relief on \nthe short-term payments.\n	     \n	     Q	  Where do those funds actually come from?\n	     \n	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  They come from the \nFood for Progress program, which is a program under USDA's \nauthority.  USDA has the authority to spend these funds.  We do \nnot need to go back to the Congress for these funds.  And I want \nto make that general point again:  Everything in this package, \nthe $1.6 billion package, comprises funds that have already been \nallocated and appropriated by the Congress.  The administration \ncan begin to spend these monies tomorrow.  And it's very \nimportant in our eyes that we expend all the funds this year, \nthat we meet these commitments.  And we are confident we'll be \nable to do so.\n	     \n	     Q	  How did you arrive at the figure of $700 \nmillion -- does that max out that program, or did you actually \nhave a range from 0 to --\n	     \n	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  There's a reason \nfor it.  The reason was that the Russian government told us \nthat's about the amount of grain that they needed between now and \nharvest time.  And so the idea is that we would begin the \nshipments probably $100 million per month from now until the \nharvest in the autumn, at which time Russia won't require the \nsame level of food imports from the West.\n	     \n	     Q	  I would imagine there's going to be some \nconsiderable envy and jealousy on the part of some of the other \nrepublics because of the size and the scope of this with Russia.  \nHave you given any consideration to advancing negotiations for \nthe same kinds of projects with the Ukraine, with Georgia , with \nsome of the other republics?\n	     \n	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Yes, we're very \nconscience of the fact that we also have an interest in extending \nAmerican support to the 11 other countries of the former Soviet \nUnion.  We have told ourselves, and we have planned that in the \narea of technical assistance, the grant technical assistance that \nyou see, roughly 50 percent of the funding will go to Russia and \nroughly 50 percent to the other countries. \n	     \n	     In the area of food sales, we have been active with \nUkraine, in grant food assistance with Georgia and Armenia.  We \nwill continue that.  And I think it's fair to say that after this \nsummit we will go back and look at all of our programs with the \nother countries to ensure that they are adequate and they are \nproductive and they're hard-hitting.\n	     \n	     Q	  Has anything happened at the summit to lead \nAmerican energy companies and other companies to believe that \nRussia is going to be more user-friendly toward them in terms of \ntaxing, legalities, bureaucracy?\n	     \n	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, one of our \nprimary objectives coming into this summit was to highlight,  not \nonly the economic agenda, but also trade and investment.  And I'd \nlike to refer to the point I made at the beginning.  We're \nconvinced in talking about this problem -- the problem of how to \nsupport Russia long-term -- we're convinced that no collection of \nWestern governments have the financial resources over the next \ndecade to fuel the continuation of reform, that only the private \nsector can do that.  \n	     \n	     We look at our own society and we see tremendous \ncapability in resources in the oil and gas sector.  It is a very \ngood match with what the Russians need now, which is financial \ninvestment in the existing oil and gas wells and pipeline and new \ntechnology and new capital to finance new production.  \n	     \n	     That's what the Russian government has told us it \nwants to do, and so that's why we have made such a major emphasis \non it.  That's why trade and investment was a prominent issue on \nthe first day of these talks, and in fact, figured prominently \nlast night in the meeting between President Yeltsin and President \nClinton.  And we're hoping that together we might send a strong \nsignal to the American business community that we support their \nefforts to invest in Russia, that the United States, through Ex-\nIm and OPEC and the Department of Commerce, will be there to \nsupport them.\n	     \n	     Q	  My question is, is Yeltsin in any position to \ndeliver on making Russia a more --\n	     \n	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  We think he is.  I \nwould note that President Yeltsin's Prime Minister, Mr. \nChernomyrdin, worked for 30 years in the Russian oil and gas \nsector.  He will now chair a high-level commission with the Vice \nPresident, Vice President Gore, to try to break through the \nbarriers that currently exist to Western investment in the oil \nand gas sector.  We believe we have a commitment to make that \ncommittee an important committee.  And we're looking forward to \nthe work.\n	     \n	     Q	  What type of mechanism is already in place to \nadminister the private sector portion of the program?  And will \nthe U.S. be directly involved in the tail end of distribution of \nthe actual funds or is the money simply turned over to the \nRussian government for distribution at their will?\n	     	    \n	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Are you talking \nabout the variety of programs listed here?  It depends on the \nprogram itself.  In most cases, though, we are either working \nthrough American PBOs or American government agencies to ensure \nthat the money obviously is well spent, that the money gets to \nthe intended source.  That's an obligation we have to the \nCongress to ensure the money is well spent and that we can \naccount for the money.  We have done that in the last couple of \nmonths intensively and we will continue to do it for each of \nthese programs.\n	     \n	     But they are all quite different.  For instance, in \nthe area of grant food and medical assistance, for grant food it \nis carried out through USDA and USDA accounts for the delivery of \nthe food.  For grant medical assistance, we've been working \nthrough Project Hope which is a private organization.  For the \nhousing -- for instance, the resettlement of Russian officers, \nwe'll be working with a group of American PBOs.  On some of the \ndemocratization projects, we're working directly with Russian \nprivate individuals and private foundations.  We're working with \njournalists in Russia on a media project that you may have \nnoticed.\n	     \n	     So we literally have here 30 to 40 different \nactivities under all these rubrics and they're all going to be \ncarried out in slightly different ways.  Some directly with the \nRussian government, some with Russian citizens.\n	     \n	     Q	  The Jackson-Vanik restrictions that remain and \non the COCOM restrictions that remain, can you tell us what the \nPresident has to do on that?\n	     \n	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, as George \nnoted yesterday, President Yeltsin raised these as irritants in \nthe relationship.  The President has noted that.  I think it's \nfair to say we will go back now in our own government when we \nreturn to Washington and look at both of these questions, and \nwe'll get back to the Russian government.\n	     \n	     Q	  You were not prepared for these questions when \nyou got here?\n	     \n	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  We were prepared \nfor these questions.  We've looked at them.  But we're not \nprepared to make a quick decision this weekend.  They require --\nlet me just explain, particularly on Jackson-Vanik.  They require \nconsultation with the Congress.  They require consultation with \nthe American Jewish community.  And we're very sensitive to those \nconcerns.  And so we'll want to go back and talk to them before \nwe take any action.\n	     \n	     Q	  Is this package designed so that you will not \nhave to go to Congress for anything at this point?\n	     \n	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  As I said at the \nbeginning, the advantage of this particular package is that all \nthe funds have been allocated and appropriated by the Congress.  \nSo the administration will not have to go back to the Congress to \nseek any additional authority to fund any of these efforts.  In \neffect, they can all begin tomorrow, and I know that many of the \nagencies responsible for these projects will begin tomorrow.  And \nthat's the advantage of this particular initiative.\n	     \n	     Q	  If this, as the President says, is a long-term, \nlong-haul thing, and members of Congress are at this moment \nheading for Moscow, why aren't you talking about going to \nCongress and suggesting to the President of Russia that you are \nprepared to go to Congress for various things?\n	     \n	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think we've been \nclear about that.  The President is discussing this weekend with \nPresident Yeltsin some additional ideas that we have for American \nfunding of additional projects, and ideas that he has.  We have a \nmajor congressional delegation that left last night, headed by \nRepresentative Gephardt and we'll want to consult with that \ndelegation and other members of Congress before doing anything.  \nAnd we'll also want to consult with our allies.  So that's where \nit stands now.\n	     \n	     Q	  We've been told repeatedly that a number of \nthese items represent different or new ways of spending the money \nalready appropriated.  Could you just tick off which of these \nitems represents reprogramming or at least spending money in ways \nthat it was not previously set to be?\n	     \n	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think that we've \nsaid that these are all projects that either Congress had \nallocated money for through the Freedom Support Act; there were \nsome funds that were left over from FY'92.  And this \nadministration took office and had some new ideas about how the \nfunds might be expended.\n	     \n	     We didn't use just the Freedom Support Act funds or \nthe FY'92 funds.  We went into some of the agency allocations --\nEx-Im, OPIC, and USDA -- and tried to look for creative ways to \nfurther our programs.\n	     \n	     And example of that is the Food for Progress \nconcessional loans.  We had hit a brick wall with another type of \nfunding through USDA.  We could not go forward legally, and so we \nlooked for a more creative way to ensure continued American \nmarket share and ensure continued grain sales, and we think we \nfound it.\n	     \n	     Q	  Where, for example, are you getting the money \nfor this Russian officer resettlement --\n	     \n	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  That's from the \nFreedom Support Act funds.\n	     \n	     Q	  In other words, all of the money is being \ndirectly spent in new ways, so to speak --\n	     \n	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Most of the grant \nprojects that you see -- if you look at the general chart, the \nsecond chart, it's broken down into grant and credits.  And if \nyou look under grants, the technical cooperation projects that \ntotal $281.9 million -- that is almost all Freedom Support Act \nfunding.  A little bit of it is leftover funds from fiscal year \n'92.  The Nunn-Lugar funds, of course, you know about the \nlegislative history of those funds.\n	     \n	     Q	     cooperation --\n	     \n	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  From FY '92?  I \ndon't have the exact figure.  It was not a considerable figure.\n	     \n	     Q	  Could you tell us please, has anything happened \nhere this weekend that will break the log jam between Ukraine and \nRussia over START -- for START I and II as a result of what's \nhappened here --\n	     \n	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Both presidents, \nPresident Yeltsin and President Clinton, will be discussing this \nissue this morning.  In fact, we haven't yet gotten to security \nand arms control related issues.  That will be this morning's \nsession.  I know that President Clinton will be very strongly \nreinforcing that this is a top priority for us.  We've been \ntalking to the Russians and the Ukrainians over the last couple \nof weeks about ways that we might help to facilitate the \ndiscussions between them.  Up to this point, this has been a very \nimportant negotiation that's been going on essentially between \nMoscow and Kiev.  And we are at the point now of essentially \ndiscussing with them if there are ways that we could contribute \nto this discussion, help to move things forward essentially.  \n	     \n	     But in terms of what is coming out of this weekend, \nI don't yet know.  In a couple hours we'll know.\n	     \n	     Q?	    Just a follow-up on the financing here.  Is \nany of this robbing Peter to pay Boris -- since it's all current \nyear appropriations, have you taken it from anyplace that's been \nearmarked and put it into this fund?\n	     \n	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  There are smoke and \nmirrors here, and I think it's an important point to note.  We \ncould have given you a page of assistance numbers that included \nout-year funding.  We're going to make a long-term commitment to \nmany of these projects -- for instance, the enterprise funds, the \nprivatization effort, the housing effort.  And we've already \ntalked to the Russians about our long-term commitment.  \n	     \n	     We could have put in really big numbers and this \ncould have been a bigger package, but we wanted to make a point:  \nThis package is FY '93.  It's funds that we have.  And we're \ngoing to do what we say we're going to do.  And the President \nfeels very strongly about that.  In the past there is a legacy \nthat the western governments, the combination of governments, put \nup large budget figures and for any number of reasons we're not \nable to meet them, we're determined, and the President is \ndetermined, to carry out every single program in this package.  \nAnd we'll do it.  \n	     \n	     But we do have a longer-term commitment, and that's \npart of the discussions on economics this weekend.  We're looking \nfor Russian ideas on what it is we can do to most effectively \nsupport reform.  And we've told them that we do have a commitment \non some of these programs beyond this fiscal year.\n	     \n	     Q	     taken it way from any --\n	     \n	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  No, we haven't.  \nOkay, the question is, have we reprogrammed any of these funds; \nso have we taken it from other countries to pay for programs in \nRussia?  The answer is no, we have not done so.\n	     \n	     Q	  In terms of funding, there is no available \nmonies left -- and you simply find a creative way to find money \nsomewhere else.  Doesn't that, in fact, support the -- theory?\n	     \n	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Not at all.  I \ndon't think it does.  That's a particular example, and the \nexample is grain sales.  The Commodity Credit Corporation credit \nguarantee program was short-term loans that Russia had to pay \nback within 12 to 15 months.  You all know about Russia's debt \nproblem, and Russia was unable to meet those commitments.  So we \nlooked for a way to do two things:  to meet Russia's requirement \nfor grain.  They're a net grain importer on a massive scale, and \nalso meet our objective of making sure that the American farmers \nhave a chance to sell their products to Russia.  And we simply \nlook for another way to finance that.  And we have legislative \nauthority to do it.  This program has been successful in other \nareas.  We had not tried it before in the former Soviet Union, \nbut we thought we should now.\n	     	  \n	     Q	  Isn't this really the Bush-Clinton aid package \nfor Russia, since these funds were really first derived by \ninitiatives put forward by President Bush?\n	     \n	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  No, I don't think \nthat's a fair characterization.  A lot of these funds were \nappropriated by the U.S. Congress is 1991, in 1992.  This \nadministration took office and inherited some obligations that \nthe Bush administration had made.  But we had a long six to seven \nweek review of this program.  We decided to meet the commitments \nthat had been made by the previous administration.  \n	     \n	     But we have gone well beyond them in funding the \nenterprise fund, which was just an idea, but the idea had not \nbeen filled out with a program.  There was no number attached to \nit.  In grouping together some projects and trying to make them \ninto a coherent whole in the privatization effort, I would say, \nis another Clinton initiative.  \n	     \n	     Further, we listened to the Russian government and \nlistened to the Russian military who told us that the \nresettlement of their officers was important to them for \npolitical and economic and social reasons.  And President Clinton \nhas responded to that.  And we are making a long-term commitment \nthat beyond this demonstration project we're going to figure out \na way to do much more in trying to settle those officers.  \n	     \n	     I would also say that the President has given \nimpetus to all of us in the agencies to think much more broadly \nabout what it is we can do on democratization, because there we \nhave some experience and some comparative advantage that lends \nitself to the Russian experience.  And in calling for the \ncreation of a democracy corps, which is another new initiative, \nwe're hopeful that we can take the resources of the private \nsector as well as the American government, to achieve that \nobjective.  \n	     \n	     So I would not characterize it that way at all.  And \nas most of you know, I am a career civil servant.  I was in the \nlast administration.  I'm very familiar with what the last \nadministration did.  And I would characterize this as a Clinton \nassistance package for Russia.\n	     \n	     Q	  There's been a lot of criticism that aid in the \npast has not gotten to the people.  Is there anything in this \noutside of the ombudsman, that will guarantee that this money \nwill not just disappear because it's being administered by the \nRussian government?\n	     \n	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think that -- I \nknow that the President and other senior officials of our \ngovernment are concerned that American money be spent wisely and \nthat it get to the source that it's intended -- for which it's \nintended.  And so we're going to take great care -- AID and the \nState Department will take great care in making sure that the \nfunds are expended properly and that they're reaching their \nsource.\n	     \n	     I would not that this package is not simply a \npackage of support solely to the Russian government.  Some of \nthese projects, especially in democratization and exchanges, are \ngoing to be worked out directly with Russian private individuals, \nwith businesses.  The private enterprise support is another \nexample of that.\n	     \n	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  If I could just add \na word on this point with regard to the SSD-related programs, one \narea that we've been looking at very, very closely is \nconsideration of actually using Russian firms in subcontracting \nfor these kinds of programs.  They would be working very closely, \nof course, with the American firms, who would be the prime \ncontractors.  But this is a fine example, I think, of a more --of \na imaginative and flexible approach toward getting some of that \nfunding down to the grassroots level, down to the ground in \nRussia; but at the same time ensuring that it is spent \nefficiently and for the purposes for which it was intended.\n	     \n	     Q	  When would the democracy corps start?  Exactly \nwhen do you see this happening?  How would get it off the ground?\n	     \n	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, the President \nis today calling for the creation of a democracy corps.  I think \nit's fair to say that we're going to work out its framework over \nthe next couple of weeks.  Ambassador Simons takes up his duties \non May 1st.  But in effect we've already started, because over \nthe last couple of weeks the administration has begun to reach \nout to people in the private sector who have come to us asking us \nto help facilitate their activities in Russia.  And we've said \nthat we will be helpful.  We've also tried to kind of coordinate \nin a much more effective way the activities of our own \ngovernment.  We do have 10 or 15 agencies that are active in \nRussia in one way or another.  We think it makes sense to draw \nthem together and to focus their efforts.\n	     \n	     Q	  Excuse me.  How much of this $1.6 billion will \nactually be spent in the United States by American made goods?\n	     \n	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I don't have any \nfigures for you now, but perhaps we could try to work something \nup in the next couple of days on that.\n	     \n	     Q	  This figure is larger than the figure that has \nbeen in the press -- did this program grow yesterday as a result \nof the discussions, or have we just been that far off the mark?\n	     \n	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  No, I think --\nunfortunately the press has been a little bit off the mark, and \nI'm sorry to say that.  No, this package -- President Clinton put \nus to work about seven weeks ago on this package.  And he was \nbriefed intensively on this.  He contributed a lot of the \nintellectual leadership in this package.  He contributed a lot of \nthe ideas in the package.  And I think it's fair to say that we \nhad this rough package worked out about two weeks ago.  We have \nbeen refining it ever since.  We spent a couple of days last week \ngoing over it with the Russian government, both the embassy in \nWashington and the government in Moscow through our own embassy.  \nAnd so it's been evolving.  But this particular package has been \ntogether for about two weeks.\n	     \n	     Q	  Where is Yeltsin's input into this then?  There \nwas so much talk before about the President wanted to get \nYeltsin's views about specifically what was needed and so forth.  \nIs that in the out years?\n	     \n	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  No, it's both.  \nPresident Yeltsin has on several occasions told us, for instance, \nthat support for the creation of private businesses is important \nto him; that the resettlement of Russian military officers is \nimportant; and that first and foremost the effort to privatize \nthe state industries is important to them.  \n	     \n	     And so what we did was to try to make those the \ncenterpiece of our technical assistance part o the package.  We \nlistened to him.  On the privatization effort, we have been \nworking with the Russian government for months on this trying to \nwork out all the details.  So the Russian government on most of \nthese programs was involved every step of the way.  \n	     \n	     But let me get at the other part of your question.  \nThe President is also using this weekend to talk about a broader \nset of initiatives that we might undertake.  And we're looking \nfor his ideas.  The President has brought his own ideas to the \ntable -- for instance, on energy and the environment and in \nhousing.  But we're looking for Russian ideas not.  We need to \nconsult with the Congress; and we need to consult with the other \nallied governments that are also active.\n	     \n	     Q	  There's essentially nothing that happened in \nthe last day and a half that measurably altered the package that \nyou came in with?\n	     \n	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  This particular \npackage, as I said, was worked out and was ready about two weeks \nago.  We have since then consulted with the Russian government on \nthe final stages of its development, and so this weekend we've \nprimarily talked about future, about what more the United States \nand other Western countries can do to support reform in Russia, \nwhich is our base objective here.\n	     \n	     Q	  I noticed that you -- that money appropriated \nto train bankers and businessmen and officers.  Can you tell me \nwhat about job training for workers who are displaced by \nprivatization?\n	     \n	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  You're right; we \nhave a program to train Russian -- young Russians in banking and \nfinancial services in the United States.  Part of the housing \ninitiative, it's not just to build housing units, it's to retrain \nRussian officers who are retiring into other professions.\n	     \n	     Q	     money for job training for workers whose \njobs are disappearing because of privatization --\n	     \n	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  We have not yet \nallocated any money for that.\n	     \n	     Q	  Why not?\n	     \n	     Q	     of the $6 million is going to build 450 \nhousing units.  Isn't that a lot of money per unit given what the \nWestern dollar will buy in the former Soviet Union?\n	     \n	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  If you want to do \nhousing the right way, it's not just the building the framework \nof a house, you've got to think about all the utilities.  You've \ngot to think about the purchase of land.  You've got to think \nabout sewage and gas and electricity and so forth.  And it's also \nretraining.  It's not enough to put retired -- an officer coming \nout of -- Riga or Tallin or Vilnius in a house in western Russia.  \nWe think we have an obligation to try to retrain those officers \nas well.  This is responding to a request from the Russian \ngovernment.\n	     \n	     Q	     of the $6 million will go to retrain --\n	     \n	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  That's right.\n	     \n	     Q	  Are you talking about apartment buildings or \nsingle --\n	     \n	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  We're talking about \nsingle, individual dwellings.\n	     \n	     Q	  You're saying that only 450 families will be \nserved by this?\n	     \n	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  What I want to -- I \nthought I pointed out earlier, this is a demonstration project.  \nWhat we didn't want to do -- given the experience that the \nGermans and the Turks and the Italians have had in building \nhousing in western Russian, we did not want to leap into it with \na huge amount of money.  What we want to do is work over the next \ncouple of months and try to figure out with American \norganizations in the private sector the best way to get this job \ndone.  \n	     \n	     I noted that we have a long-term commitment to that.  \nAnd so I would expect that we would put a lot more money into \nthis in the future .  But we want to do it wisely; we want to \nspend the money wisely.\n	     \n	     Q	  What is it about this program that convinces \nyou that it will protect Russia's reforms and that Russia will be \nin a position to may back the money they're supposed to pay back, \nespecially considering their other debt problem?\n	     \n	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, look, I think \nit's important to note that the United States on its own does not \nhave the capability to fuel a continuation of Russian reform.  \nIt's got to be a collective Western effort, and we're looking to \nour allies to do more as well.  But beyond that, it's really what \nthe Russians do that is going to decide the fate of reform.  We \ncan simply play a role, and we feel we have an obligation to do \nso, which is consistent with our national interests.\n	     \n	     Q	  Did the President say that the value of the \nU.S. contribution was that it would create security and \nprosperity for the United States?  So what is it about this \nprogram that does this?\n	     \n	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think you have to \ngo back to the fundamental objective of our policy toward Russia, \nand that is we want to do everything we can to support the \ncontinuation of reform.  We are convinced that if reformers stay \nin power, then we'll be able to continue the drawdown of nuclear \nforces, foreign policy cooperation and economic interaction, \nwhich are the three benefits to the United States from reform in \nRussia.  So it's not a simple question.  You can't just say that \nthis program is the answer.  It's a long-term question and we \nhave to make a long-term commitment to it.\n	     \n	     Q	  And then on the question of Russia's ability to \nrepay, what convinces you they'll be able to pay seven to 15 \nyears from now?\n	     \n	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, the Russian \ngovernment has made a commitment to repay, and what we're hoping \nis that if reform continues, and if they can continue to improve \ntheir oil and gas sector and earn additional hard currency \nrevenues, that Russia will be in a position six or seven years \nfrom now to pay back those loans.\n	     \n	     Q	     substantial government-to-government loan \nwe've ever gotten into with the Russians?\n	     \n	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I don't want to \nanswer authoritatively on that.  I don't go back 20 or 30 years \non this.  But in the last four or five years, yes it is, because \nthe previous way that we financed grain exports was really to \njust ensure private bank loans.  This is a different type of \neffort.\n	     \n	     Q	     government loans in any other sector that \nyou recall?  I know it wasn't done in --\n	     \n	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think it's fair \nto say this is a new and unique effort.

Actually not.  Brett himself has actually posted the data previously.\nWhat declined from 84 to 89, as I remember it, was _percent\nincrease_in_deficit_growth, i.e. the rate of growth of the deficit \n(2nd derivative of total deficit with respect of to time) decreased.\nBrett apparently has numbed himself into thinking that the deficit\ndeclined.  If you keep spending more than you earn, the deficit keeps\ngrowing.  If you keep _borrowing_ at a lesser rate than you borrowed\npreviously, the deficit increases.  You only decrease deficits when your\nincome exceeds spending and you use the difference to pay off debts.\n\nFiggie's book paints the real data, pictorially, in gory detail.  Each\npresident, essentially ran up twice as much total debt, in half the time.\nReagan/congress was simply awful.  Bush/congress was unbelievable.\n\nAs a really rigorous aside to this thread.....\n\nDuring pledge night the other night on the public channel, there was an\n"economist" who gave an hour or so presentation.

He confirmed, with data, what many of us know\nwith common sense -- the boom of the 80's has nothing to do with government\npolicy, particularly "supply side" policy, since taxes do not "cause" \neconomic activities.  People cause economic activity.  More can be \nexplained by watching population waves roll through the years and \ncreate cycles.  He has made models and predictions for years well into\nthe middle of next century.  It will be neat to see how accurate he\nis.

To answer your irrelevant question, yes a person of color is human,\nbut I still don't know what you mean by human being and you have\nmerely begged the question without responding.  By trying to inject\nthe notion of race into the discussion, you muddy the waters without\nadding any insight whatever.  The same parallel question could\nbe "Is a polydactyl person a human being?"  You still have not\nanswered what you mean by human being.  Please do so.\n\n\nYou won't answer the question and instead drag in irrelevancies.\nIf you want a definition of human being that does not depend on\nthe vagaries of law, but holds solid whatever the law may rule,\nprovide it for me.\n\n\nMore irrelevancies.  As Larry Margolis pointed out, the law\nhas made special exceptions in order to include fetuses, but does\nnot follow your version of human being.  And as he pointed out,\nbrain death is not a means of determining who has the rights\nof the living, but rather who has died.  There is a significant\ndifference.\n\nWhat I am wondering now is, has your argument so failed you that\nyou feel it necessary to drag out irrelevancies and leave the\nthread you started?  You got answers to your questions when\nyou began baiting me, if you recall, after you had made some\nridiculous remarks about Adrienne Regard and, having been corrected,\nchanged the subject with your remarks about having a discussion\nof substance.  If you really wanted a discussion of substance,\nwhy then do you disregard logic and substance in order to toss\nsilly accussations, e.g. "It really doesn't matter to you..."\nIf it matters to you, then why not define human being and seek\nsome substance?  You're not going to convince a logical person\nof the rightness of your position unless you apply some logic\nand show some meaning to your words.\n\n\nAs others point out, one is sacrificed for the other depending on\nwhich has the better chance at survival.  Again, your analogy\nfails.  Not precedence, but possession makes a difference here.\nA woman's womb is indisputably her own.  Also, I see you ignore\nmy statement that you would grant rights to a fetus that would\nnot be granted a born human being.  Was that due to its inconvenience?\n\n\nIs it?  Please cite a precedent and the basis of the ruling.\n\n\nYou simply assert things without any support.  Your analogy is\nnot accurate and your assertions are unsupported.  Try this on\nfor size.  It is not murder for one Siamese twin to kill\nthe other in the womb.  There.  We now have equal arguments.\nBut the idea is illogical.  For one Siamese twin to kill the\nother in the womb would likely be to kill itself as well.  The\nsystems are dependent on each other for life.  I'm still struggling\nto see anything analagous here and failing to do so.\n\n\nYour argument is from Fantasy Island.  Your comparison is a total\nfailure, as I have demonstrated already, and has no basis in\nreality, neither legally nor medically.  And for you to assert\nthat it is not a perfect comparison because of the impossible,\nthat of coercion or oppression, is ridiculous.  As I said,\nyou give the analogy too little credit for failure.  On the one\nhand you start this by saying you want to take a real, rather than\na hypothetical, situation, then you fly off into Siamese twins\nmurdering one another in the womb or coercing or oppressing each\nother in the womb when the reality of the situation you describe\nin now way matches your version.  As I said before, decisions\nare made regarding which twin lives and dies in situations where\nthey cannot both survive.  And, furthermore, as I have already said,\nthere is a difference between an equal claim to organs and a claim\nthat is unequal.  You seem to be asserting that a fetus has a\nclaim on a woman's womb.  When the fetus is born, what happens to\nits claim?  And by what reason do you assert its claim?\n\n\nYou haven't answered the question.  The situations are not analagous.\n\n\nAgain you avoid the question.  Dependence can be transferred, and\nit is not as slow as you seem to think.\n\n\nYes, and I'd hate to have been the one to tell Dr Gunn's children that\nhe was murdered by a religious, "pro-life" fanatic.  Please do\ntry to stay relevant.\n\n\nClever comeback.  I congratulate you on the readiness of your wit.\n\nWhat happened to that claim to bodily organs where life is at stake?\nWhy does this parent now have an indisputable right to his or her\nkidney when previously the parent did not, by your standards?  What\nis different about the two situations?  I see I have to spell this\nout for you since the meaning was too subtle for you.  In the one\ncase you do not recognize a difference between a fetus and a born\nchild (you ask why a born child cannot be abandoned but a fetus\ncan), and in this case you recognize a significant difference\nbetween the fetus and born child where the lives of the two are at\nstake.  You can't have it both ways.  Action and inaction are\nirrelevant to the principle, but you are wrong about the inaction\nanyway.  Ask any of the numerous women who post here and have\nborne children how inactive their pregnancy was.  To have a\nhealthy, live child, a woman does more than hang out, eat as\nshe chooses, plays volleyball like she always did, drinks at\nparties with her friends, etc.  She behaves very differently, and\nthe provision of her resources to a fetus may be no more voluntary\nthan the beating of her heart, but it is far from inactive.
Well yes and no. The Federalist papers are propaganda and it is therefore\ndifficult to determine precisely what Maddison etc were up to from them. They\ncertainly emphasised a limited role for the federal government but this\nwas not necessarily their true position.\n\n\nThe Senate was less powerful than the House of Lords in the period in question.\nThe stripping of the powers of the House of Lords did not occur until 1914\nand David Llloyd George's budget. Even despite this the House of Lords has\nconsiderable power even today and is far from a rubber stamping body. \n\n\n\nThe system is meant to be slow to react, the problem is that it ended up\na bit too slow.\n\n\n\nThe Presiden't veto was meant to be entirely separate. Until Bush abused it\nin a quite extraordinary manner it was used more in accord with the intent\nof being a check on unreasonable legislation. The veto was clearly regarded \nas a completely last gasp measure its use was meant to be restricted to\npreventing the legislature interfering with the actions of the executive.
Actually, what the study shows is that 2 percent of the men surveyed\n*said* they engaged in homosexual sex and 1 percent *said* they \nconsidered themselves exclusively homosexual.\n\nThe point being that what people say and what they acutally do\nmay be different.\n\nIt is interesting that this clip from the newspaper did not\nmention that difference.  Maybe it is conservative media bias.  :-)

I don't understand what you are getting at here.

I also wish that you could (if you wanted) experience the joys and\ntrials of being committed to someone for life (there is something about marriage\nthat makes the commitment much greater than one might expect).\n\n\n\nDon't forget about the culture.  Sadly, we don't (as a society) look upon\nhomosexuality as normal (and as we are all too well aware, there are alot\nof people who condemn it).  As a result, the gay population is not encouraged\nto develop "non-promiscuous" relationships.  In fact there are many roadblocks\nput in the way of such committed relationships.  It is as if the heterosexual\ncommunity puts these blocks there so as to perpetuate the claim that gays \nare immoral.  "My, if we allowed gays to marry, raise children ... we might\njust find out they're as moral as we are, can't have that can we?" \n\nJust some thoughts.  Flame away. :)
THE WHITE HOUSE\n\n                    Office of the Press Secretary\n_________________________________________________________________\nFor Immediate Release                             April 14, 1993     \n\n	     \n                       REMARKS BY THE PRESIDENT\n                      AT SUMMER JOBS CONFERENCE\n\n	     	  \n                            Hyatt Regency\n                        Crystal City, Virginia  \n\n\n11:22 A.M. EDT\n\n	     \n	     THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  The speech that \nOctavius gave says more than anything I will be able to say today \nabout why it's important to give all of our young people a chance to \nget a work experience and to continue to learn, to merge the nature \nof learning and work; why it's important to honor the efforts of \npeople like Jerry Levin and Nancye Combs and Pat Irving and all of \nthose who are here.  \n	     \n	     I want to thank the Secretaries of Labor and Education \nand all the people who work with them for sponsoring this; and my \ngood friend, Governor Wilder, for being here and for speaking; and \nall of the business and local community leaders from the city and \ncounty and state level from around America who are here. \n	     \n	     This has been a pretty fun day.  (Laughter.)  I loved \nhearing the young people sing.  It was music to my ears because it is \ntheir future that we are really struggling about.  (Applause.)  A \nyear and a half ago I began the quest to seek the presidency because \nI was concerned about their future.  Because I believe that our \ncountry, which had always been a beacon of hope for the young, had \ntoo little opportunity, was too divided among ourselves across lines \nof income and race and region and other ways, without a vision to \ntake us into the future.  \n	     \n	     I entered with the hope that together we could create \nmore opportunity and insist on much more responsibility from all of \nour people.  But in the process we might recreate the best of \nAmerica's community, knowing that together we could always to more \nthan we could individually and that we might secure our future.\n	     \n	     All of you here today are committed to that.  The 1,000 \njobs that Jerry Levin has committed Time-Warner to is symbolic of the \ncommitments made by many of the private sector people who are here, \nand those who are around the country.  The work that Nancye Combs \ndoes, and the successes of all the young people like those on this \nstage, and especially the eloquent statement Octavius Jeffers -- all \nthose things show that together we know what we need to do, and we're \non the right track.\n	     \n	     Last July when I was traveling across America's \nheartland in my luxurious bus, I visited Seneca High School in \nLouisville, Kentucky.  And there I met young people and business \npeople who were participating in the Louisville Education and \nEmployment Partnership.  I saw what Nancye Combs talked about today.  \nI saw how the young people were making an extra effort to succeed \nboth in school and at work.  I saw, as I have seen many times in my \nown state, the principle illustrated that Octavius has talked about \n-- that for millions of American young people it is really an \nimpediment to both their learning and their ability to be good \nworkers to draw a sharp dividing line between what is work and what \nis learning.\n	     \n	     In the world in which we are living, the average young \nperson will change the nature of work seven or eight times in a \nlifetime.  We must learn to merge the work world and the learning \nworld much better.  And we must determine that all of our young \npeople see the opportunities that some of them have had showcased \nhere today.  \n	     \n	     Whether you're in business or in government or in \neducation, you know that we have a big job to do when it comes to \nbuilding a future that really, honestly includes opportunity for all \nof our people.  There are still a lot of people who say, well, things \nare pretty good here in Washington and everything's fine; the best \nthing we can do about this whole thing is nothing.  They all have \njobs.  (Laughter.)  All the people who say that.  (Applause.)  \n	     \n	     They all have health insurance.  They all have a pretty \ngood education.  And they all have a pretty secure knowledge that \nthey'll be okay no matter what happens.  I say that not to be either \npolitical or unduly critical, but to point out that one of the great \nchallenges of this age for every advanced nation -- everyone -- is to \nfully develop the capacities of all of its people, and then find work \nfor them to do.\n	     \n	     All the European countries have higher unemployment \nrates than we do, but also stronger support systems for the \nunemployed.  The Japanese unemployment rate has been going up.  \nThey're going to adopt a stimulus that, even if you count it in its \nmost rigorous terms, is three or four times bigger than the one that \nI have proposed to create jobs. \n	     \n	     In West Germany alone, the unemployment rate is now \nabout as high as ours.  This is a big problem for advanced nations.  \nIt costs a lot of money to add an extra employee, with a lot of \npressure from low-wage producers in other countries that are growing \ntheir own economies and trying to provide new opportunity for their \npeople.  \n	     \n	     But it is especially important for America for two \nreasons:  One is, we have a whole lot of folks who, unless we move \naggressively, will not have the education and skills we need to be \ncompetitive and productive in a nation like this.  The second is, \neven if we educate them all, if there aren't jobs they will be robbed \nof the fruits of their educational labors.  People need to be able to \nwork in this country.  (Applause.)\n	     \n	     We have always had some unemployment; and, indeed, some \nof it is normal.  You've always got some people leaving jobs and \nmoving around the country and doing first one thing and another.  We \nhave now, at this moment in our history, the necessity for all big \norganizations, including the government, to reexamine the way they \nare organized and who ask whether there are too many people working \nat some kinds of jobs.  But in the whole, we must still be able to \ncreate jobs in a country like America, to provide people with the \nchance to work.  \n	     \n	     It's going to be difficult for me to make the welfare \nreform proposals that I will make to Congress in the next couple of \nmonths -- it's going to be hard for me to make those work if, at the \nend of all this work, to get off welfare there isn't a job.  \n(Applause.)\n	     \n	     So we have two tasks.  One is to develop the capacity of \nthe American people to perform without regard to race or income or \nthe circumstances of their birth.  The other is to make sure that \nthere are some opportunities for them to bring to bear for their \ntalent and to be rewarded with a paycheck.  It is a great challenge.  \nI do not pretend that all of the answers are simple.  But I know if \nyou want to ask the American people, all of them, to be more \nresponsible, if you want to recreate a sense of community in this \ncountry that bridges the lines of race and income and region, you \nhave got to have opportunity in that mix. \n	     \n	     A part of our vision for America has to be a future for \nevery young person in this country who's willing to play by the rules \nand work hard and strive for the end of the rainbow.  There has to be \nsomething at the end of that rainbow.  And that is what we are \nbasically here to talk about today:  What can we all do as partners, \nrecognizing none of us can do it alone, to develop the capacities of \nour people to succeed wherever they live and whatever their \nbackground.  And then, what can we do to make sure that there's \nsomething there for them to do?\n\n	     The summer jobs program we're discussing today is an \nintegral part of that plan, because it will promote the values of \nwork and opportunity and fairness, community.  It will put the people \nfirst, and it does have a partnership between the public and private \nsector.\n	     \n	     I said when I addressed the United States Congress in \nFebruary on this program that I would seek to create about 700,000 \nextra summer jobs from government sources and then challenge the \nAmerican business community to meet that target so that we can create  \nmore than a million new summer jobs over and above what had been \ncreated before.\n	     \n	     Many, many people have responded to that challenge.  And \nJerry is just a shining example of that which has been replicated in \nthis room and around the country -- people who are going to do more \nthan they otherwise would in the private sector to give young people \na work experience.  And it is terribly important.\n	     \n	     I want to emphasize that this summer jobs program is \npart of an overall commitment to increase the capacity of the \nAmerican people -- from retraining defense workers who lose their \njobs and other adults who need to acquire new skills; to improving \nthe transition from school to work for young people who don't go to \ncollege but do need at least two years of post-high school training \neither on the job or in a community college or a vocational setting, \nso that they can be competitive workers, making it possible for more \npeople to go on to college who do want to go.\n	     \n	     All these things are part and parcel of a comprehensive \nplan.  It's also important, as I said, that we create more jobs.  The \nemergency jobs program that I asked the Congress to adopt would \ncreate a half a million extra jobs over the next year and a half, and \nthat would reduce the unemployment rate by a half a percent.  It \nwould also enable us to absorb more young people coming into the work \nforce in jobs that otherwise will not be created.\n	     \n	      It also will help a lot of cities and counties to \ninvest in things that need to be done at the grass-roots level --\nprojects long delayed, water projects, sewer projects, park projects, \nnew industries and particularly in small and medium-size communities \n-- a whole range of things that will improve the economy and improve \nthe environment.  \n	     \n	     The summer jobs program is an important part of that \nbecause we have tried for the first time, through the work of the \nLabor Department and the Education Department and through reaching \nout to people like you, to make this more than just a one-shot summer \njobs program; to integrate it with private sector efforts; to \nhopefully replicate it in each coming summer; to move these young \npeople into further educational opportunities and to further job \nopportunities; and to have a strong, meaningful education component \nto these summer jobs -- something that the United States government \nhas never fully emphasized before.  \n	     \n	     A lot of these young people, as you well know, because \nthey come from difficult backgrounds, because they go to school in \ndifficult and challenging circumstances, need extra help in building \ntheir basic skills in math and language, reasoning and in other \nareas.  And a lot of educational studies show that young people who \nhave difficulty in school often forget as much as 30 percent of what \nthey learn over the summer and then that has to be repeated the next \nyear.  \n	     \n	     What we are trying to do here is to give people the \nopportunity to learn good work habits and to reinforce their learning \nskills and to put them together; and then, hopefully, over the next \ncouple of years, if our entire program passes, to give every school \nin this country the opportunity to have a good work and learning \nenvironment.  \n	     \n	     There will be more applied academics, more opportunities \nfor people to learn and work during the school year, so that this \nwill not simply be an isolated moment for these young folks, but will \nbe a part of building a whole new educational experience, a whole new \nwork experience, and moving on a pathway to a better future.\n	     \n	     The summer jobs programs are not designed to be make-\nwork jobs.  They're designed to make a future for the people holding \nthe job.  And that's what they will do.  In the process, they'll help \nto build local communities, to strengthen local economies, to solve \nlocal problems.  Real jobs -- renovating housing, repairing public \nbuildings, doing clerical work, providing nursing assistance in \nhospitals, supervising and training children at child care centers, \nand learning all the way.  Challenging young people to learn while \nthey earn, but letting them earn.\n	     \n	     You know, it's very difficult to make a case to people \nwho have never seen opportunity on their own street that they should \ndo this, that, or the other thing if there's no evidence of the \nopportunity that's at the end of the effort.  I have not been sparing \nin going for the last year-and-a-half into places where it isn't \nexactly popular to say it, and say I wanted to reform the welfare \nsystem; I wanted to toughen child support; I wanted to require people \nto work; I was sick and tired of people being irresponsible in the \nuse of guns on the streets, and I wanted to change all that.  But if \nyou're going to summon people to greater responsibility, you have to \nreward them when they do the right thing with opportunity.  \n(Applause.)\n	     \n	     The young people we propose to put to work under our \nprogram will spend 90 hours learning basic skills, such as math, \nreading, writing -- either on the job in the classroom.  They will \nstretch their minds as well as work up a sweat.  They will have a \nsense of accomplishment.  It will literally be a summer challenge, \nbut a challenge that will take them into a different life.\n	     \n	     So I want to ask all of you to support this effort even \nas I, as your President, support your effort.  At the end of the \nsummer we will evaluate all the young people who participate.  We'll \nsee whether they, instead of falling behind over the summer \nacademically as too many young people do, they stayed even or moved \nahead.  I suspect that they will.  \n	     \n	     This summer, Secretary Reich and Secretary Riley and I \nwill be visiting many of your communities.  We'll really try to learn \nfrom you which of these efforts are working, what we should do next \nsummer, how we can build it in to what goes on during the school \nyear, how we can build in our job training efforts and the works that \nwe do with your companies to make sense of this whole thing -- so \nthat we maximize the impact of the taxpayer dollar and your private \ninvestments as well. \n	     \n	     We want to honor the companies and the communities, the \nbusiness leaders and the young people who do the very best jobs this \nsummer.  And, again, I want to say to all of you in private business \nwho have matched our effort, I thank you.  And to all of you who \nhaven't, and those across the country who may listen or learn about \nthis event today, I want to implore other private employers to \nstretch a little bit to give other young people a chance to work this \nsummer.  I'm telling you, we cannot go through another 10 years when \nwe don't give these children anything to say yes to.  If we exhort \nthem to do right, we've got to be able to reward them.  (Applause.)\n	     \n	     When the other speakers were talking, I was sitting up \nhere on the platform, listening and reveling.  And they got talking \nabout work, and I got to thinking about all the different things I've \ndone to make a living in my life.  When I was 13, I made a very \nfoolish short-term business investment:  I set up a comic book stand \nand sold two trunks full of comic books.  Made more money than I had \never had in my life.  But if I had saved those trunks, they'd be \nworth $100,000 today.  (Laughter.)\n	     \n	     That does not mean young people should not be \nentrepreneurial.  It just means that you can't foresee a generation \nahead.  I have mowed yards and cleared land and built houses and \nworked in body shops and the parts departments of a car dealership.  \nAnd I've done a lot of different things for a living.  Some \npeople say I got into politics to escape work.  (Laughter.)  \n	     \n	     I learned something from every job I ever had.  But I \ngrew up in a generation where I literally did not know a living soul \nwithout regard to race or income who wanted to work who didn't have a \njob.  I grew up in a generation when all you had to really say to \npeople is, get an education and you'll be all right.  You'll get a \njob and you'll make more money next year than you did this year.  Now \nI live in a generation full of people, most of whom don't make any \nmore money in real dollars than they did 10 years ago and they're \nworking longer hours and they're paying more for the basics of life.  \nAnd we are now wondering whether we can create the jobs that these \nyoung people want.\n	     \n	     Now, I want to close by reemphasizing these two things:  \nIt doesn't matter what kind of economic policies this administration \npursues, or how much productivity increases there are in the private \nsector, if young Americans don't get a good education, don't learn \nhow to work and can't be productive, those jobs will not be created \nin this country.  Machines will do the work or the work will be done \noff-shore by people who have the same skill levels and can work for a \nthird or a fourth or a fifth the wages.  So nothing we can do \neconomically will matter unless we build the skills and capacities of \nAmerica's work force.  And anybody that pretends otherwise is just \nkidding.  \n	     \n	     On the other hand, we need to be honest.  Every wealthy \ncountry in the world, including the United States, is having \ndifficulty creating jobs.  If I knew everything that needs to be done \nI'd be glad to tell you and we   could just call off the whole \ndeliberations of Congress and everything else.  I don't have all the \nanswers.  But I know this:  Doing nothing is not the answer.  \n(Applause.)\n	     \n	     And so the jobs program that I have presented to \nCongress, with the summer jobs, with the money for the cities and the \ncounties, through the Community Development Program, with the \ninfrastructure money, is a small part of a big budget.  It is an \nattempt to engage in an experiment to see whether or not, with the \neconomy recovering in terms of corporate profit, we can give a little \nboost to it, give opportunities to young people, create a half a \nmillion jobs and maybe get the engine going again.\n	     \n	     Most of the jobs in this program are going to be jobs in \nthe private sector, not government jobs, even though it's government \nmoney.  And the lion's share of the work in rebuilding the American \neconomy obviously will come from the private sector.  That's the kind \nof system we have and it works pretty well.  \n	     \n	     But this is the challenge we have.  So I ask all of you \nhere today to support the summer jobs program, to ask your friends \nand neighbors to support it, to go back home and ask your employers \nto make a little extra effort; to do what you can to help me pass the \nfunds to create the 700,000 jobs that the United States government \nshould create this summer, so that together we can have this \npartnership.  Because more than anything else, we have to give a \nfuture -- a future that our young people can believe in.  \n	     \n	     We need to send them a message that here in America if \nyou study hard and work hard, if you obey the law and contribute \nsomething to your community, you will be rewarded by your country.  \nYou can build a future from you own dreams. \n	     \n	     That has always been the promise of America.  Together \nthat's what this summer of challenge needs to be:  a reaffirmation of \nthe promise of America for so many young people to whom that promise \nhas been an illusion.  We can make it a reality.\n	     \n	     Thank you very much.  (Applause.)
Unfortunately, there's not much we can learn from the statistics presented\nhere either.  Due to rounding, the 1991 est. for LSD could be anywhere\nfrom .550 to .649 and the 1992 est. could be anywhere from .850 to .949.\nThis means that the actual change (if you believe these statistics in the\nfirst place) was anywhere from 31% to 73%.  Similarly the increase in\ncocaine use could be anywhere from 18% to 66% and the increase of\ncrack use could be anywhere from 29% to 120%.  This doesn't even\ntake into account the margin of error which isn't provided here.
In <1993Apr15.045651.6892@midway.uchicago.edu>, thf2@midway.uchicago.edu sez:\n\nEven if Brett's eventual-return figures were correct -- and they\nclearly weren't -- he'd still be wrong about the cause for the '86\nblip because he fails to consider 2 basic factors:\n\n1) As Ted notes, not everyone is a long-term investor.  One might find\noneself, as I did in late 1986, anticipating expenses in the near term\nthat require selling off holdings.  Given the choice between waiting a\nfew weeks (and taking an extra tax hit) or selling in December with\npreferential tax treatment, only a fool would choose the former.\n\n2) The fact that Brett can now construct _post hoc_ calculations of\nwhat would have been more beneficial to investors is in many respects\nbeside the point.  There was plenty of _Money_-style advice given to\nunsophisticated investors in late 1986 to "sell now and save on\ntaxes."  In case anyone missed it, there was no shortage of similar\nadvice late last year (in the NYTimes, e.g.), even though that advice\nwas based not on the foregone conclusion of enacted law (as in 1986),\nbut merely on the *assumption* that Clinton would raise tax rates\n(without capping CG taxes, contrary to the current proposal).\n\nIt's nice to think that investors always behave in their optimal\neconomic interest.  Like assuming weightless ropes and frictionless\npulleys, though, this sort of thinking often fails to describe\naccurately what happens in the real world.
