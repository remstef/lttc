Hi,\n	I am looking for some help in choosing a package\nfor a high-speed silicon ADC (100Mhz) currently being \nfabricated. This is a PhD research project and I have to test\nthe chip at speed on a PCB. I expect to have roughly 100\npackaged circuits and will do DC, low-speed and high-speed\ntesting using 3 different set-ups for the test chip.\n 	\n	I know for sure that a DIP will not work\n(the long lead lines have too high an inductance).\nGetting a custom-made package is too expensive, so\nI am trying to choose between a flatpak and a\nleadless chip carrier. The flatpack would be hard\nto test since it has to be soldered on to the test\nsetup and I would spend loads of time soldering \nas I kept changing the test chip. The leadless chip\ncarrier sockets also have long lead lines and may\nnot work at high speeds.\n \n	Does anyone out there have experience/knowledge\nof this field ? I would greatly appreciate help! Any ideas/\nnames of companies manufacturing holders/sockets/packages\nwould help. \n \nP.S. The multi-layer fancy GaAs packages seem like a bit\nof overkill(?)
My Beckman died a few days ago, thanks do about a 4 or 5 foot drop onto a\nlab table.  !@#!@$#!@$@#$  Probably not indicative of anything, but I've\nalready filled out the requisition for a Fluke 87. :-)\n\nOh yeah, and sometimes our measurements here do count.  Not often, but often\nenough that I want at least _one_ good meter!
I missed the first article[s] on this line due to not having a\nchance to read the news for a couple of days...\n\nThe idea is commercialized in at least one product, the Private\nEye.  That's a small cube-shaped device that the user straps around\nthe head similar to a sweat band.  There is a boom that comes from\nthe side on which the device is mounted so that it is positioned\nin front of the user's eye.\n\nThe Private Eye we had here for evaluation was Hercules-MDA\ncompatible.  The innards are a row (~400 LEDs) that are swept up\nand down by a galvonometer-like movement.  The result is that the\nsweeping LED bar forms a fused raster.  There is a virtual image\nprojected in front of the user that the visual system tends to fuse\nwith the background.\n\nI didn't like the device very much.  I found it easiest to use if I\nlooked at a blank white wall.  I had problems with focus tracking\nif I glanced down to look at my keyboard for an out-of-the-way key.\nThe unit also emitted a soft buzz and vibration which I found\nannoying.  Some people didn't seem to mind the buzz.  Properly\nused, however, the image clarity was quite crisp.\n\nI don't know if the company has taken the technology any further in\nthe last year or two, but it did seem to have promise.
Hi,\n\nRight now I should do some characterization of opamps. Because I don't  \nhave\nspecial equipment for this task, I have to do this job with relativly  \nsimple\nequipments (Frequency sweeper, DSO, etc.). \nDoes anyone know good test circuitry for characterization of opamps? \nEspecially for measuring open-loop gain, phase margin, PSSR, CMMR and so  \non.\nAre there any books or application notes on this subject available?\n\nPlease reply vi e-mail or nn.\n\nThanks\nMark
The most practical use I've seen for them is as key ring ornaments :-)
Nonsense.  First, the uranium fuel is sealed in zirconium\nalloy cylinders (which don't melt in any circumstances short of \nmajor failure of the power plant).  Second, the primary water\n(that circulates inside the reactor core) is never pumped into the\ncooling tower (it's the SECONDARY water cycle that goes \nthrough the cooling tower).  Third, liquid uranium would burst\ninto flame on contact with air.\n\n\n	Cleaning crew working in a mist of uranium?  This is a\ntoxic heavy metal, even if it WEREN'T radioactive.  Shouldn't there\nbe some smileys here?  Or frowneys?
I wouldn't bother with the copy protection, if I were you.  If you program\nis any good, the pirates will have stripped the protection and will be\ndistributing the stripped version is well under a week.\n\nHardware methods prevent J. Random Loser from using his Copy II PC to pirate \nyour software, but doesn't stop anyone who knows a few people with enough \nconnections to "real" pirates who _will_ be able to defeat your "check for the \nhole" code.\n\nYou may want to price your software (depending on what it is) a tad\nhigher... a price change from $15 to $25 probably would turn off very few\npotentials buyers, and that way you could tolerate more pirates (whose\nnumbers don't change with the price).\n\nAs for the 20% pirating figure... ha, ha.  Of course, a lot of pirates just\nhave this "thing" about having pirated software, even if they never use it,\nso perhaps that really wouldn't count towards 20%.  Even so, 20% is awfully\nlow.\n\n\n					---Joel Kolstad
I believe that the "A-D converters" found on a joystick port are really\ntimers that tick off how long it takes an R-C circuit (the R being your\npaddle) to charge up to something like 1/2 Vcc.  For games this works\npretty well, but you certainly wouldn't want to try to take lab\nmeasurements off something as non-linear as that.\n\nHmm... I suppose you could linearize it in software, but the real problem\nis that the precision of your measurement is no longer constant (higher\nvoltages would be more precise).\n\nOn the other hand, I could be wrong and perhaps the game card designers\nsplurged for the extra $.50 to make a cheap constant current source out of\nan op amp.  But I wouldn't expect that...
Does anybody out there have one of those food dehydrators I've been seeing\nall over late-night TV recently? I was wondering if they use forced air, heat,\nor both. If there's heat involved, anybody know what temperature they run at?\nMy wife would like one and I'm not inclined to pay >$100.00 for a box, a fan\nand a heater. Seems to me you should be able to throw a dehydrator together\nfor just a few bucks. Heck, the technology is only what? 1,000 years old?
: A quick and dirty way to get higher current carrying capacity\n: on PC board traces for one- or few-of-a-kind boards is to\n: strip some #14 Romex house wiring cable to bare copper, form\n: the bare copper to follow the trace, and solder it down.\n\nAnd if it's not quick and dirty, you can get bus bars that\nare stamped out with leads that insert in the PC board.
Careful now folks... Also consider the 90VAC+ @20Hz that is forced on ring\nand tip when the phone's supposed to ring!  Even with a simple zener\nand LED setup, you might end up with some carbon real quick.  Whatever\nscheme you use, make sure you've got at least 200V-rated components on \nthe frontend.\n\nAlso remember that, if I'm not mistaken, the phone line is a 600ohm\nequivalent circuit.  Any current you draw from the 48V or so gets\ndropped across that 600ohms.  That's fine until you're down to roughly\n12V, when Ma Bell considers it to be off-hook.  But dropping it that\nfar down is probably a big no-no.\n\nThe easiest implementation to accomplish the above??\n\n    tip  ------->|-----\/\/\/\-----+----------+\n              rectifier  resistor  |          |\n              diode                |          \ \n                                   V          /\n                          zener  /---/        \  resistor\n                                   |          /\n                                   |          |\n                                   |          V   LED\n                                   |         ---\n                                   |          |\n    ring --------------------------+----------+\n\nThis is only a suggestion...go ahead and blow holes in it, but you\nget the idea.

There has been quite a bit of discussion about house wiring and grounding\npractices here.  A few points need to be clarified:\n\nThe Equipment GROUNDING conductor, Green, green with a yellow stripe, bare, or\nthe metal sheath or pipe of SOME wiring methods, is used as a safety ground, to\ncarry fault currents back to the circuit breaker panel, and to limit the\nvoltage on the metal case of utilization equipment or other metal objects.  It\nshould never (except for a few exceptions to be discussed later) carry the\nnormal operating current of a connected load.  Some equipment has filters in\nthe power supply which may cause some slight current flow through the grounding\nconductor.  \n\nMuch communications or audio equipment is sensitive to noise or slight voltages\non the grounding conductor, and may require special wiring of the grounding\nconductors to provide reliable operation  ("orange" outlets are often used for\nthis, with insulated grounding conductors wired back to the panel box, and in\nmany cases back to the service.  Anyone installing such a system should read\nboth the section on grounding in the National Electric Code and publications on\ninstalling quiet isolated ground systems.  The code requires the insulated\ngrounding conductors (green wires) to run with the current carrying conductors\nback to the panel box, and, if required, back all the way to the service\nentrance , where it is bonded to the service ground (water pipe or rod)  Many\nof these systems are installed illegally or unsafely, where they do not provide\na safe ground or a quiet ground or either. \n\nThe GROUNDED conductor of a circuit, often called the NEUTRAL, which is\nreferred to in the code as the "identified" conductor and is supposed to be\nwhite or natural grey.  This conductor is supposed to be connected to ground in\nmost electrical systems at a single point, generally at the service entrance\npanel.  This connection is through the Main Bonding Jumper.  (In many household\nservice panels, the main bonding jumper is actually a bonding screw which\nattaches the neutral busbar to the case of the panel)  \n\nThe Grounded conductor (neutral) is generally a current carrying conductor.  In\nthe case of a 120 volt circuit it is one of the two conductors completing the\ncircuit from the panel to the load device.  \n\nSince the grounded conductor (neutral) is only connected to the grounding\nconductor (bare or green) at the service entrance, if the load is any distance\nfrom the service and draws any significant current, there will be a small but\nmeasurable voltage between the grounded and grounding conductors at the load,\nunder normal operating conditions.  If you should (incorrectly) connect the\ngrounded (neutral) conductor to the grounding conductor at the load, some of\nthe neutral current will flow instead through the grounding conductor.  Since\nthere will now be current flowing through the grounding conductor, it will also\nno longer be quite at ground potential at the load end.  If the load equipment\nhas a metal case, which is connected to the grounding conductor through the "U"\nground plug, the metal case is now also no longer quite at ground potential. \nThe difference (under normal, non short-circuit conditions) may be only a few\ntenths of a volt, but it could also be a volt or two.  This normally does not\npresent a shock hazard.  \n\nHOWEVER, if you let the metal case of the grounded equipment come into contact\nwith an independently grounded object such as a water or gas pipe, a radiator,\na metal air conditioning duct or such, part of the neutral current will try to\nflow through this aalternate ground path.  If the contact is not solid, you\nwill get a significant arc (a low voltage, but possibly moderate current arc)\nUnder the wrong conditions, this arcing could start a fire.  It is possible in\nsome cases that the sneak ground current   could also flow through a wire of\ninadequate size, causing it to overheat.\n\nWith the incorrect non single-point grounding of the neutral, if there is a\nshort circuit from hot to neutral, the high short circuit current which may\nflow will cause a much higher voltage on the grounding conductor, which\nincreases the possibility for shock or fire.  \n\nAlso if you incorrectly multiply connect the neutral and ground, the voltage on\nthe ground system is seen as noise bu computer or audio equipment, often\ncausing malfunction.  I have spent some hours tracking down such shorts in\ntechnical facilities where they were inducing severe hum into equipment.\n\nThe Neutral is usually bonded to the ground at the distribution transformer as\nwell as at the service entrance of each dwelling.  This is done primarily for\nlightning protection, so that induced lightning currents have a short path back\nto ground, and also to assure that the currents drawn by shorts to grounded\nobjects like pipes draw enough current to trip circuit breakers or blow fuses\nquickly.  The bad side of this is that not all the neutral current from the\ndwelling goes through the neutral wire back to the transformer.  Some of it\nflows through the grounding electrode (water pipe, etc.) this may cause\ncorrosion in the pipes and possibly in things like underground fuel oil tanks,\nand it may also cause measurable AC magnetic fields due to the large loop\nbetween the "hot" conductors in the service and the neutral current in the\nwater pipe and ground.  There are those who feel these fields may be unhealthy. \n(don't flame ME on this, I'm just telling you where the field comes from, not\nit's health effect, as far as I'm concerned, the jury is still out on this.)\n\nNote that the bonding jumper is only installed at the main panel, NOT at any\nsub distribution panels.  This is one reason why it is illegal to run service\nentrance cable with the sheath used as a neutral to a sub panel, you must have\na seperate insulated conductor for the neutral.  The sheath can be used in this\napplication only as the groundING conductor.  If the neutral is bonded to the\ngrounding conductor in the sub panel, say by forgetting to remove the bonding\nscrew, all the grounding conductors of the loads on that panel will be above\nground, with the possible problems listed above.\n\nThe code makes exceptions for ranges and dryers, as well as feeds from one\nbuilding to another.  In the cases of the range and dryer, the neutral may be\nused as the equipment ground under certain conditions, instead of a seperate\nwire.  Every time the code is revised, these exceptions come up for review. \nThese exceptions were, in fact the first required safety grounds, in the days\nbefore U ground outlets and such.  The appliance manufacturers don't want to\nhave to redesign their ranges and driers, and the contractors don't want to\nhave to run four wire cable (with four fairly heavy, expensive wires) in place\nof three wire to the appliances.  No question it would be safer with seperate\nneutrals to the stove, but the neutral current is low for most burner settings\n(since most current is in the 220 volt "hots" except at some low settings, the\nwires are large gauge, and there are few reported cases of injury or damage. \nSo far, the exceptions have survived. In the case of feeds between buildings,\nit's primarily for lightning protection.\n\nPeople doing wiring should be aware what is and what isn't a legal grounding\nconductor.  Obviously, the bare wire in "romex" 'with ground' is.  Anywhere\nthere is a green wire installed, such as in a portable cord, that is a good\ngrounding conductor.  The sheath of BX clamped in BX connectors in metal boxes\nis a legal grounding conductor (in the US). (BX has an aluminum band run under\nthe steel sheath to lower the resistance of the sheath.  You can just cut this\naluminum band off at the ends, you don't have to bond it to anything, it does\nits job by touching every turn of the BX sheath.) Conduit or EMT (thinwall\ntubing) is generally a legal grounding conductor, but may require a bonding\nlocknut where it enters a box or panel, particularly for larger pipes.  \n\n"Greenfield" (looks like big BX, but you pull your own wires in the empty\nsheath after you run it) is NOT a legal grounding conductor, as it doesn't have\nthe aluminum band to bond it, and the spiral steel has too much resistance and\ninductance.  You have to run a seperate green grounding conductor inside the\ngreenfield.\n\n"Wiremold" is also not a legal grounding conductor, as the paint on the boxes\noften prevents good contact, and the "feed" to the wiremold extension is often\nfrom a box in the wall that may not be well connected to the first wiremold\nbox.  I have personally discovered cases where the entire run of wiremold and\nthe cases of everything plugged into all the outlets on the run were "hot" with\n120 volts (Why do I get a shock every time I touch my computer and the radiator\nhere in the office?) because there was no ground wire in the wiremold and one\nof the outlets had shorted to the edge of the wiremold box.  You must run a\nground wire back in the wiremold from the outlets at least to the first box in\nthe original wiring (conduit, BX, etc.) where you can "bond" the wire to the\nbox with a screw, bnding clip, or whatever.\n\nOn another issue, while you should ground the green wire/lug on GCFI outlets\nwhen ever there is a place to ground them, it is legal in the NEC to use them\nwithout a ground if no ground is available.  It is better to have the\nprotection of the Ground fault interrupter than no protection if you don't\ninstall it.  The interrupter doesn't depend on the ground to trip.  It is\ndesirable to connect the ground if available, because if the ground is\nconnected, the interrupter will trip as soon as a faulty device is plugged in,\nwhereas without the ground, it will not trip until someone or something\nprovides a ground path.  For those questioning the legal use of ungrounded\nGCFI's, read in the NEC, 210-7 (d) exception. (This is the 1990 code, my '93\ncode is in the city, but I know the rule hasn't changed.  It might be\nrenumbered though.) \n\nWe have only touched the surface concerning grounding ;-} , there is much more\nto this subject, but most of you have fallen asleep by now.  \n\nJohn

Perhaps you're using the wrong brand! (Sorry all HP fans, but I have\na hard time being convinced that their scopes match the rest of their\n(excellent) gear).\n\nOne of the principal functions I look for when considering a DSO is\nwhether you can turn interpolation off. The other important feature\nis to disable repetitive waveform acquisition i.e. being able to lock\nthe instrument into real time capture mode.\n\n\nI agree with you here. The only consolation is that manufacturers are\n_beginning_ to pay attention to ergonomics when designing the menus.\nHowever, to be fair, it seems that first time scope users (our students)\nseem to adjust to menus easier than navigating around the twenty or\nmore knobs required of a "real" scope :-)\n\n\nThis is one area that newer DSOs are addressing. I recently evaluated\nthe latest box from Tek - their TDS320 - which seems to be a worthy\nalternative to a standard 100MHz analogue CRO. This instrument has\na 100MHz, 500Ms/s spec, meaning that it is _always_ in real time\ncapture mode. The pricing also matches equivalent analogue scopes in\nthe range. The downer is that the instrument uses menus again, but at\nleast they appear to be logically laid out.\n\nOne more thing about the new, "simpler", front panels. These instruments\ntend to use digital rotary encoders as knobs now. This is a vast improvement\nover the old oak switch. The single most common cause of failure in our\nscopes (other than students blowing up inputs!) is mechanical wear on these\nswitches. I look at the new panels as a great step toward increasing the\nlongevity of the instruments.\n\nJohnH\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n      |  _  |_   _   |_|  _   _|  _|              Electronics Department\n    |_| (_) | | | |  | | (_| (_| (_| \/           School of MPCE\n    ---------------------------------/-           Macquarie University\n                                                  Sydney, AUSTRALIA 2109\n\n    Email: johnh@mpce.mq.edu.au, Ph: +61 2 805 8959, Fax: +61 2 805 8983

I had the good luck to obtain an EICO dynamic conductance \ntube tester for a song. Unfortunately, I was a little out of\nkey; the only thing wrong with it was an open meter movement.\nDoes anyone know where I can find either another meter movement\nlike it, a dead-but-not-the-meter-dead unit, or schematics \nto specify the current scale of the meter movement?

If the set is direct line powered, try checking the [likely to be\nthere] hybrid regulator module down stream from the 170 volt\nsupply.  Several sets I've looked at use a 135 volt regulator.  The\nregulators have a tendency to short out, making the safety circuits\nshut down the EHT supply section.\n\nTry putting the set on a Variac or adjustable transformer and lower\nthe AC input voltage to the set to about 90 volts.  If the set\noperates nromally, then you know you've got a shorted regulator.\n\nThere are myriad other areas for problems, but I've seen the one\nabove several times.  Also, if the set uses one, the trippler\nmodule may be shot; that's fairly common.

Like most high-volume manufacturers, Adcom has most of its PC boards\nassembled off-shore (in their case, mostly in the far east).  Final\nassembly _and testing_ are done in East Brunswick.\n\nThe products are, and have always been, designed entirely in the US;\nby their own staff and by audiophile gurus like Walter Jung.  Adcom\nalso tends to prefer American and European components over their\nJapanese/Far East equivalents.\n\nOff-shore assembly is one reason that Adcom is able to make products\nthat perform as well as those from people like Audio Research and Van\nAlstine (and better than Hafler and Forte'), but at a much lower cost.\n\nOf course, if your musical diet consists mostly of Rock, you might\nprefer components from Kenwood or Pioneer...

What you have is one of the LD players from a video game (Dragon's Lair,\nSpace Ace, etc). Call Pioneer Technicial Support 213-498-0300 (at least\nthat's the number I called them at) and ask for the LD-V1000 Interface\nGuide. It shows how the parallel interface should be wired and the codes\nfor the commands (play, pause, reject, etc). The guide is mainly for hooking\nthe player to a computer, but with a little work, you could build a wired\ncontroller.

GEC/Plessey specify a series of FM demodulators (SL1454 etc) for use in\nsatellite TV receivers : 150 or 600MHz in, 10MHz of baseband video out.\nI think there's also a related data slicer / clock recovery circuit intended\nfor use in DMAC decoders, though that isn't used in the most common \nimplementation - it may not be in volume production.\n\nThe most easily available components probably vary with local satellite\nstandards, and I think the european systems vary rather widely from those\nin the US - so it may be worth investigating locally-available receiver\ndesigns to find out what's in common use.\n\n-adrian

DEC did this on their new alpha chip.  I'm sure you could call them up\nand ask them how they did it (haha).\n\nActually, there are some details in their article in IEEE Journal of\nSolid-State Circuits.  I think it was sometime around Nov.  1992.
I'm wondering if it's possible to use radio waves to measure the\ndistance between a transmitter(s) and receiver?\n\nSeems to me that you should be able to measure the signal strength\nand determine distance. This would be for short distances (2000 ft),\nand I would need to have accuracy of 6 inches, or so.\n\nHow about measuring vertical distance as well, any chance - or am I getting\nridiculous?\n\nWhat frequencies would be best for this? Or does matter?\n\nSorry if I'm "mucking up" the network with one of those questions best\nanswered by Bill Willis via US Mail... and I apologize for not being\n"tuned-in" to electronics. :-)
[deletions]\n\n\nSounds like it is an SMD interface to me, not being at work now\nto actually count pins.  there are two varients, SMD  and\nSMDC (I think), only minor differences between them.  Widely used\nprior to the advent of SCSI for large drives (or all drives) on minis\n(and mainframes(?) no experience on those).
The father of a friend of mine is a police officer in West Virginia.  Not  \nonly is his word as a skilled observer good in court, but his skill as an  \nobserver has been tested to be more accurate than the radar gun in some  \ncases . . ..  No foolin!  He can guess a car's speed to within 2-3mph just  \nby watching it blow by - whether he's standing still or moving too!  (Yes,  \nI realize that calibrated guns are more accurate than this, but . . .).   \nHis ability is not that uncommon among people who watch moving things for a  \nliving, I have heard . . ..\n\nSo what good is a radar detector except to give you a split second warning  \nthat the guy who just cut you off to pass the guy ahead and to your left  \nis about to panic stop from 85 on a crowded freeway???
Aaahh... a problem very near and dear to my heart. In our case, other\nmonitors cause this problem - the deflection coil of other monitors to be\nspecific. Have also seen a monitor backed up to a fuse panel exhibit this\nproblem. This sounds like your problem since flourescent lites, motors, etc\nseveral 10s of feet away seem to me to be too far to cause it, but the\njuice running to them must pass nearby your monitor. Fusebox on other side\nof wall maybe?\nWe started spec'ing Panasonic CT-1331Y video monitors (3 switchable input\nlines(vid & aud) S-VHS on one) <$400. This stopped the wavy interference\neffect on the computer monitor next to it. \nNow on to your problem. You need what is known as mu shielding (very\ncommon, in fact almost mandatory on electrostatic deflection type\nO'scopes).\nI talked to a EE prof. He said get a coffee can, cut both ends off, mount\naround deflection coil of interfering monitor. \nBE CAREFUL TO AVOID ALL HIGH VOLTAGE CIRCUITRY. ESPECIALLY THE THICKER HIGH\nVOLTAGE ANODE LEAD USUALLY COLORED RED. IF YOU KILL YOURSELF, DON'T\nBLAME/SUE ME!!! USE PLASTIC OR OTHER NON-CONDUCTING STAND-OFFS AND SUCH TO\nMOUNT CAN.\nNow, I would assume that what is good for keeping mag fields in is also\ngood at keeping them out, so hopefully this'll work by mounting shield on\nmonitor being interfered with as well. If not, start shielding those other\nsources.

True (especially for electrolytic capacitors at high temperature).\n\n\n\n	Low power quartz oscillators are usually 32 kHz (and THESE\nhave significant temperature drifts, which one doesn't often notice\nwhile wearing the watch on one's wrist).  Low temperature sensitivity\nis available in other crystal types, which unfortunately\nare larger and higher frequency (1 MHz or so) and take more\nbattery power.  \n\n	Programmable timers might be less accurate, but they\nare more power-stingy than suitable crystal oscillators.

We'll let you live, but just this once....\n\nThere's more to a real "storage" scope than just a long-persistence\nphosphor.  Actually, the phosphor ISN'T usually anything special at all;\nwhat makes a storage tube work is a screen placed just *behind* the phosphor,\nwhich becomes charged as the electron beam intially "writes" the trace.\nWith the trace now written to the screen, a separate low-level "flood"\nelectron gun keeps the image lit by exciting those areas of phosphor\nwhich are next to the "written" areas on the storage screen.  There are\nsome problems with this - the resolution is limited compared to a non-storage\ntube, and the stored trace tends to "bloom" with time. \n\nOf course, this is pretty much obsolete technology, done in by the current\ndigital scopes which use raster-scan displays and keep everything in a\nframe-buffer memory anyways.\n\n          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nAh, yes - from the same people who brought you that amazing new reading\nprogram that's sweeping Eastern Europe: "Hooked on Consonants!" :-)
Here is a different viewpoint.\n\n\nIn practice there is little difference in quality but more care is needed \nwith inkjet because smudges etc. can happen.\n\n\nA cheap laser printer does not manage that sort of throughput and on top of \nthat how long does the _first_ sheet take to print? Inkjets are faster than \nyou say and in both cases the computer often has trouble keeping up with the \nprinter. (I have a 486/33 and a lot of drivers cannot keep up with the \nprinter)\n\nA sage said to me: "Do you want one copy or lots of copies?", "One", \n"Inkjet".\n \n\nPaper cost is the same and both can use refills. Long term the laserprinter \nwill need some expensive replacement parts (consumables) and on top of that \nare the amortisation costs which favour the lowest purchase cost printer.\n\nHP inkjets understand PCL so in many cases a laserjet driver will work if the \nsoftware package has no inkjet driver. \n\nThere is one wild difference between the two printers: a laserprinter is a \npage printer whilst an inkjet is a line printer. This means that a \nlaserprinter can rotate graphic images whilst an inkjet cannot. Few drivers \nactually use this facility.\n(there is also the matter of downloadable fonts and so on)

just a suggestion:\ntake a motorola mc14536B set it up to give you a pulse once every sec or ten\nsecs with either a RC or xtal clock input. then feed to a MC14521B as clock\ninput and decode output for 1,209,600 sec output ,might have to add a few 'and'\ngates or decoder chips to get output and reset pulse back to the'521 to restart\ncycle... Trigger a oneshot from the decoded riseing edge ;the one shot then\ngoes to a mosfet to drive the mechanism to fire the pellet launcher..\nthese ckts require uAmps of current,between 5 - 15 volts, so a 12 volt\ngel cell of a few Amphours would last the six weeks.\nThen take the ckt board & battery wrap in 3" or 4" of foam or build a box\nof out of the stuff...with plywood or metal exterior...\nbuild a small heater out of 10-50 Watt resistors in series to keep the battery\nand ckts warm.\n2nd thought use 2 batteries one for heater one for timer and pellet trigger.\n\nInsolate-insolate.......even though the chips state that the - AL\nrated devices are good to -55 C.. The batteries have a considerable reduction\nin capacity...oh make sure the area inside has minium air leakage..\n\nhope this helps\nRW     ( is this to long winded for the net??)(be gentle)...
I guess 100k, connecting pins 1-3 (1x), 1-6 (1y), 9-11 (2x), and 9-13 (2y).\n\nOr: Get an 8-bit DA-Converter (merely a couple of transistors and\nResistors) and an OpAmp to compare its output to the voltage you want to\nmeasure, connect them to a spared printer port (if you have one), and do\nthe rest by software (stepwise refinement). The port addresses for your\nprinter ports are probably: &H378 (LPT1), &H278 (LPT2). This should work\nwell enough for your purposes.\n\nHope this helps\n\n--\nGMD,  Schloss Birlinghoven,  Postfach 1316,  D-5205 St. Augustin 1,  FRG

It is illegal to use anything you eavedropped on for a business \nor for an illegal use.  Jurisdictions that ban radar detectors or\npolice monitors, are essentially making the claim that there is no\nother reason for a radar detector or police radio monitor. \n\nThe results of fighting these claims in courts have been mixed.\nThe federal courts are not anxious to intervene and state courts\nhave sometimes held that the feds have exclusive jurisdiction\nand sometimes they have not.  A lot of state courts do not have\nenough imagination to see any use for a radar detector besides\navoiding law enforcement action for speeding.\n\nWhen you buy a radar detector, amongst the guarrantees, instructions, \nexplanations, and other detritus, is an invitation to join an\nassociation dedicated to preserving your right to use a radar detector.\n(I promise I am not making this up!)\n\nI do not think radar detector manufacturers would be making any \nheadway at all in courtrooms if police departments enforced speed \nlaws with a strict eye to public safety and a blind eye to the fund\nraiser aspect of tickets.

Hello--\n\nI just bought a new portable CD player for the office, and I notice that\nit proudly proclaims "8 TIMES OVERSAMPLING" on the box.  Now while I think\nI understand what oversampling is (the rate of discrete "samples"\nexceeds the highest frequency component of interest by some factor),\nI don't understand this "8 TIMES" business...  It seems to me that when\nI bought my first CD player (was it REALLY 10 years ago?!), the specs\nsaid "4 TIMES" ...  Could someone please tell me whether I'm getting\nsenile?  If I'm not, then what good does it do for the player to take\nsamples at a higher rate?  If I really wanted better fidelity, wouldn't\nI have to have the same higher rate of sampling during the recording\nprocess?  Furthermore, am I wrong in interpreting the sampling rate\n(from the player's point of view) as being the same thing as the data\nrate for the bit stream coming off the optical medium?  Does this mean\nthat the data rate (related to the rotational speed of the disk) has \nchanged since 1983?\n\nI'm so confused...  \n\n--Cliff
Hmm... now where was that ad for the combination radio/hand cranked\ngenerator/flashlight/siren I saw? :-)\n\n[function generator has a 50mV offset, and the amplitude's too high]\n\n\nSure, you've already got the right idea.\n\nIgnoring the 50 ohm internal resistance of the generator for a second, just\nrun it into, say, a voltage divider made of 990 ohms in series with 10\nohms.  This new circuit is the Thevenin equivalent of one that puts out\n1/100 of the original voltage, and has an output impedence of negligibly\nless than 10 ohms.  You may want to monkey with the values a little\ndepending on whether you care more about the _exact_ dividing ratio or\nthe availability of parts.\n\nHows that sound?\n\n					---Joel Kolstad
Just a thought........Maybe it possibly has to do with the fact that it\nIS an Emerson.  I've got an Emerson VCR which is #6 in the series.  Returned\nit six times for various and never the same problems.  Got tired of taking it \nback and fixed it myself.  The Hi-Fi "window" was a bit off.  Something like\nthe Hi-Fi audio fine-tuning.  When I was a Wal-Mart "associate" in '88-'89,\nwe had AT LEAST one returned as defective EVERY SINGLE DAY.  How's that for\nreliability?  Face it--Emerson can make audio stuff (albeit not of premium\nquality), but they CAN'T make anything as complex as video equipment with \nreliability IMHO.  Please, no flames.  Just *had* to share my Emerson disaster\nin the light of this exploding tv.  \nJC
Several years back one of the radar detectors manufacturers, in\ndefiance to Virginia's law against radar detectors, passed out\nthousands of fake cardboard radar detectors at truck stops near\nthe Virginia State lines.  At that time there were no radar\ndetector Detectors!  I am not sure of the impact but I would\nimagine that enforcement of the law by visually sighting a\nradar detector became difficult - if not impossible!\n\nAs I said earlier, efforts to throw out or eliminate the VA law\nagainst radar detectors has been in vain.  In fact, effective\nJan. 1, 1993, the fine for possession of a radar detector\naccessable to the driver of a vehicle in VA is now $250.00.  \n\nI have noted an interesting anomality with my Alinco DR-100 2\nmeter ham transceiver.... It will make a *cheap* radar detector\nscream!  I am not sure of the range, but it is obvious by the\nbrake lights that it can be at least 50 feet at 50 watts! :-)
Yes, I know it's nowhere near Christmas time, but I'm gonna loose\nNet access in a few days (maybe a week or 2 if I'm lucky), and wanted\nto post this for interested people to save 'till Xmas.   :-(\nNote: Bell Labs is a good place IF you have a PhD and a good boss, I\nhave neither.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSubject: Xmas light set with 2 levels of brightness\n\nAnother version of a variable brightness Xmas light set:\nThis set starts with a 2 blinker 35 bulb string.  \n\nDIAGRAM:  orginal 2 way set\n\n120v---+--b-*-*-*-*-*-*-*--!\n       !---b-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-!\n                           !\n120rtn_____________________!\n\nmodified set for 2 level brightness:\n\n                string 1\n120v---------*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*--!\n  \_10K_______*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-!\n    5w    !      string 2     !\n          b   ________________!\n120v rtn__!___!\n\n             ^ Note: no mods to wiring to the right of this point.\n\nOnly one blinker is used.\n\nNote that the blinker would not have as much current thru it as the\nstring 1 bulbs, because of the second string of bulbs in\nparallel with it.  That's why the use of the 10K 5W resistor\nhere to add extra current thru the blinker to make up for the\ncurrent shunted thru the second string while the blinker is glowing\nand the second string is not glowing.  When the blinker goes open,\nthis resistor has only a slight effect on the brightness of the\nstrings, s1 slightly dimmer, s2 slightly brighter.  \nOr use a 3W 120v bulb in place of the 10K resistor if you can get\none.  Caution, do not replace with a standard C9 bulb, as these\ndraw too much current and burn out the blinker.  C9 = approx 7W.\n\nWhat you'll see when it's working:  powerup, string 1 will light \nat full brightness, and b will be lit, bypassing most of the current \nfrom the second string, making them not light.  b will open, placing \nboth strings in series, making the string that was out to glow at a \nlow brightness, and the other string that was on before to glow \nat reduced brightness.
From what I understand about radar dectectors all they are is a passive\ndevice much like the radio in your car.  They work as an antenna picking\nup that radar signals that the radar gun sends out.  Therefore there would\nbe no way of detecting a radar detector any more than there would be of\ndetecting whether some one had a radio in their car.

Since the digital transmission schemes include error correction and\nconcealment, the performance remains about the same down to a very low\ncarrier-to-noise ratio, below which it degrades very quickly.  Hence,\ndigitally compressed TV is supposed to be less susceptible to interference\nthan amplitude modulated TV.

: >I want to upgrade my system and was thinking of buying Adcom seperates.\n: >I have heard from alot of people, though, that Adcom sounds great but\n: >that the components are made cheaply and therefore won't last very long.\n: >The time estimates I've heard are like only 3 or 4 years.  Is this true?\n\nI own the Adcom 60W power amp.  As far as I'm concerned, there's no\n  amp which can touch it at the price range.\nThe build quality is very impressive and is far superior to other \n  amps in the price range.  The whole amplifier is extremely solid\n  with massive heat sinks and very solid casing.\nIf you open the amp up, there are only very good quality components \n  in and the amp seems to be designed extremely well.  Perfect\n  symmetry for both channels and TWO transformers - one for each\n  channel.  The binding posts on the back of the amplifier are\n  virtually the same as those on the Classe model 70 ie. very good.\n\nI was also sceptical about the amps being built in the far-east\n  or where-ever.  But if you look in the amp and see what components\n  they use and how it was designed, you can easily see why the\n  amplifiers sound so brilliant.\nI cannot see why people say the amplifier won't last - not with\n  those quality components inside.  Sure the amp runs very fairly\n  hot - but that's how you get an amp to sound incredibly good.\n\nMy last point, I recently auditioned the Adcom preamp something like\n  the 545 or something.  It was two years old and it still sounded\n  like new.\n\nIf you build an amplifier decently, like the Adcom's, they will\n  sound brilliant and last a long time - period.\n\nJust my thoughts, but then - I do own one of Adcom's amps.
With relays alone, you will always get a transient when\nyou abruptly turn ON or OFF any channel.  If you don't want to hear\nthe transient, use some other device (a photoresistor-output optoisolator\nis the usual sort of thing) to gently MUTE the signal, then switch,\nTHEN remove the power from the lamp in the optoisolator.\n\n	It used to be standard practice to employ photoresistors\nin switching audio, because the photoresistor time delay (a few\nthousandths of a second) kept any noise in the digital side (which\ndrives the lamp) from contaminating the audio.  And, the devices\nare cheaper than relays.
Water. Nuclear stations don't generate electricity directly from the\nreactor, they use the reactor to generate heat. The heat is then used to\nheat water just as in a conventional oil or coal station, and the\nresultant steam drives the turbines.\n\nThe cooling towers are used to cool the steam and recondense it into water\nto continue the cycle\n\nSteve
Yes.\n\nI use 74HC4066 and others commerically for this purpose so rest assured it \nworks fine. In one case I route bit serial digital audio using these and it \nis difficult to see any signal degradation at all which surprised me given \nsome pretty fast edges. HC4066 is spec'd at something like -3dB @ 200MHz into \n50 ohms. The more complex types are generally a little slower and more \nresistive.\n\nPlain 4000 series are not so good at handling 5v logic.\n\nRemember that the output load is seen by the input device.

Check out Xicor's new goodie in the April 12th edition of EETimes\nX88C64 - an 8k * 8 E2PROM with built in latch AND bootloader setup.\nYou hook it directly to your '51, power it up, the prom initialises the\nserial port on the '51, you load in your code via RXD, this gets blatted\nonto the E2PROM, then you reset and run - i'm sure Dallas also does\nsomething like this too, i suppose it would boil down to relative\nprices, and the Dallas part freeing up P0 & P2 completely.

I was having a look through a couple of components catalogues when I\ncame across a range of Peltier Effect heat pumps intended for cooling\ncomponents.  For those who have not heard of this effect, you put a\ncurrent through one of these devices, and it pumps heat from one side\nto the other.  Reverse the current and you reverse the effect.  I\nthink a temperature difference can give you an EMF as well.\n\nAnyway, it struck me that you could make a nice cool/hot box for\npicnics with one of these, a power regulator, a thermostat and a\ncouple of heat sinks.  The biggest device can shift 60W with an\nefficiency of 80-90%, which ain't bad (although it would flatten my\ncar battery in about half an hour).\n\nUnfortunately the catalogue didn't list anything more than the basic\nspecs as a heat pump.  I imagine that you would get a back-EMF as the\ntemperature gradient across the device increases.  If so, presumably\nits power decreases as the back-EMF increases, until eventually we\nhave a steady state with no current being consumed (assuming no\nleakage).  If so, then the final temperature difference between the\ntwo sides could be set by the supply voltage and nothing more\n(although that would be a lousy way to control it).\n\nWhat I would like to know is:\n\n1: Are the above guesses correct?\n\n2: What is the open-circuit thermal resistance of a typical device?\n   (I just want to be sure that my coolbox is not going to get warm\n   too fast when I unplug it)\n\n3: How does a Peltier Effect heat pump actually work?  It looks like\n   magic!\n\n4: Why don't they use these things in domestic fridges/freezers?\n\n\nThanks in advance,\n\nPaul.
Just a shot here, but ya never know:\n\nI once bought a (REAL) cheap equalizer / power amp for my car tape player \nat one of those motel-room truckload sales, and it sounded great.  For a \nwhile, that is.  Then one channel quit entirely.  I opened it up, and the \namplifier chip for the bad channel had simply melted some of its solder \njoints attaching it to the PCB.  I soldered them back and it worked fine.  \nI just had to keep the volume a bit lower than I did before.  Probably \nlousy heat sinking.\n\nYou said "a nice Alpine" which I'm sure is a few orders of mag higher\nin quality than the P.O.S. I had.  But the point is - look inside before\nyou scrap it, since you OCCASIONALLY find something you can repair.\nMaybe even the same thing I found.
After I have produced a schematic with PADS-LOGIC, how do I import it into \nPADS-PCB to create a PCB pattern?

I've got two lines coming into my apartment. Two different telephone numbers.\nWhen I ordered the second line installed, instead of bringing out another 4\nwire bundle, the telco just connected up to my yellow and black wires. So I\nhave one line on red & green and the other on yellow & black.\n\nToday I was monitoring the voltage on both lines. I had a voltmeter across\nthe red and green and read back 52 volts. I then lifted up the receiver on my\nsecond line.(black & yellow wires) The voltage dropped to 31 volts on the first\nline. (red & green wires) I repeated this experiment with the second\nline(monitoring black & yellow and lifting the handset off the cradle on the\nred and green line.) It also dropped to 31 volts. \n\nWhy is this ? I thought these were separate lines.\n\nNext I went to the 66 block and disconnected the blue and white lines coming in\nfrom the telco cable. I then disconnected all the phones in my apartment and\nwent back to the 66 block and did some resistance measurements. Both lines read\nopen.\n\nI'll appreciate any help on this. Is this considered normal ?\n\nGuy Urbina

I second that suggestion.  Although I don't own the HP Portable Deskjet,\nI *do* own the HP Deskjet 500.  It gives the nicest outputs, with only\na minor loss of quality.   For all intensive purposes (papers, letters,\nresumes), I treat my Deskjet like a laser printer (You *do* have to\nlook a bit closely to see the blurs in the characters).  Only one\ngrudge, the ink that HP gives you does smudge rather quickly in the\npresence of moisture (Even though the ink is waterproof).  However,\nyou would have to spend about $500 more for laser quality.\n\nThe cannon bubblejets are nice, however they don't seem to have as\nmuch support (eg: drivers for popular programs) as the HP ink-jets.\nAlso HP Deskjet (regular,plus,500,500c) accepts xerox paper (I believe\nthat the cut-sheet feeder is an option for the cannon bubblejet).\n\nIf you don't mind refilling your printer with cheap ink (say\nfountain-pen ink), then the HP deskjets are *very* cheap to maintain\n(I paid $3.50 for my last bottle of ink and I expect it to last 9\nmonths). \n\n	-Kimball (who doesn't work for HP, but just loves his printer\n		  very much!)
Well, I'm not too sure if this would be the right place to post this, but\nanyway, here goes:  I was just noticing that some of the current bubblejet\nprinters offers up to 360x360 resolution while a lot of lower end laser\nprinters only offer 300x300.  However, the laser printers still seems to be\nsignificantly pricier than the bubblejets... how is this?  Or am I missing\nsomething about the resolution thing?

Write a good manual to go with the software.  The hassle of\nphotocopying the manual is offset by simplicity of purchasing\nthe package for only $15.  Also, consider offering an inexpensive\nbut attractive perc for registered users.  For instance, a coffee\nmug.  You could produce and mail the incentive for a couple of\ndollars, so consider pricing the product at $17.95.\n\nYou're lucky if only 20% of the instances of your program in use\nare non-licensed users.\n\nThe best approach is to estimate your loss and accomodate that into\nyour price structure.  Sure it hurts legitimate users, but too bad.\nRetailers have to charge off loss to shoplifters onto paying\ncustomers; the software industry is the same.\n\nUnless your product is exceptionally unique, using an ostensibly\ncopy-proof disk will just send your customers to the competetion.

The unit would power up the PC when the telephone rings and\nkeep it up as long as the telephone connection is present.\n\nI also need to be able to power up this same PC through the use of an external\ntimer.

Hello netters:)  Does anyone out there know any FTP sites for projects,\nplans, etc of an electrical nature?  \n\n-Jason
Here's a question for all you electrical engineers out there:\n\n  I bought an 'Infrared detector module' at Radio Shack for $3.95 - it is a \nlittle gizmo that senses infrared remotes and produces an output signal. Then\nI hooked the output through a transistor to an infrared LED. The circuit works\nlike a minature remote control extender in my car - All remote commands are\nrelayed to the CD player hidden in the glove compartment. It works fine with\nmy Denon CD player, but when I tried to build the same circuit for a friend's\nVCR, it didn't work.\n  The circuit appears to work for other remotes (you can see infrared with a\nSony CCD camcorder) but coincidentally it only seems to work for my CD\nplayer...\n\n	Any advice would be appreciated....\n        Brian
Hi.  I was doing research on subliminal suggestion for a psychology\npaper, and I read that one researcher flashed hidden messages on the\nTV screen at 1/200ths of a second.  Is that possible?  I thought the\nmaximum rate the TV was even capable of displaying images was 1/30th\nof a second.  (or 1/60th of a second for an image composed of only odd\nor even scan lines)
Does anyone know what causes the ever-growing black border around the\nedges of my computer screen?  The growth has been gradual so I don't\nknow how long it's taken to get this bad.  I have a 19" DEC (?)\ncolor monitor, maybe five years old, and the black border is about 1.1\ninches on the left and right sides, about 1.75 inches on the bottom and\nnegligible at the top of the screen.  The only controls are\nbrightness knob, contrast knob, deGauss switch, and power switch.\n\nIs there anything to be done, or are the monitor's days numbered?

I was wondering if anyone out there in net-land knew of a SIMPLE\nway to make a 4-band equalizer (single channel).  I need it to accept\nLINE inputs (tape deck, CD player, etc.) and output to the same! So\ninput impedance should equal output impedance.  Also, since I am driving\na line, I would need 1 volt p-p output.  Final requirement is that I\ncan either:\n	      1. Control it digitally\n			OR\n	      2. Control it easily, or with few resistors
Hams can legally run up to 1500 watts.  It is very unlikely, however,\nthat a ham would be running that kind of power from a car.  Ham rigs\nfor cars put out around 100 watts.  It is possible that a 100 watt\nradio would cause interference to consumer electronic 100 feet \naway.  Most TVs, stereos, and VCRs have very poor RF shielding.\nIf you experience the problem frequently, it may be \ncaused by a ham, CBer, or other radio operator in a base station\nnearby.    The interference may have been caused by a radio \ntransmitter used for other purposes, such as police, fire,\netc.  If you heard voices over your stereo, I think you are\ncorrect in assuming that the source is an RF transmitter.\n\nIf you have frequent trouble, you may want to try the RF ferrite\nchokes available at Radio Shack.  The interference is probably\nbeing picked up by your speaker wires, and those chokes can\nbe installed on the wires very easily (without cutting them).\nGood instructions are included with the chokes.\nIf that does not solve the problem, you may want to search your\nneighborhood for a radio operator.  Look for antennas on the roof\nor car.  Talk to him/her about your problem.  There are things\na radio operator can do to reduce interference.\n\n--
Greetings. I've been seeing the word "storage" mentioned\n	around oscilliscopes but I'm curious, what does it mean?\n\n	If my life depended on it, I'd say that it's a scope that\n	uses long-persistance phosphor to keep the successive\n	taces on the screen for some unit of time - "store" them.\n	Do I get to live?\n\n	Also, I've been shopping for a decent, used, [old] scope\n	since my Tek 514A (portable...NOT!) and my Heathkit O-1000\n	are all single trace and I need more... like 2 or 3 and at\n	least 50MHz (maybe 100...)\n\n	During my shopping at hamfests etc. I've run into the \n	problem of "old scope" terminology. I can imagine what\n	a "mainframe" and "plug-in" are but some things like\n	the above "storage", "coax input" (Hey, where do I get a \n	probe that fits this? I had to fiddle with mine for a week \n	before I got anything resembling "a good trace" - they all\n	come with BNC connectors!), "unblanking" (huh?), and, oh,\n	just like my 514 manuals, MANY changes were made along the\n	way to the schematic - scopes, even with IDENTICAL model \n	numbers, have different (better?) response/performance than\n	others - how can I pick the better one? Does the rule of the\n	higher SN the better apply?\n\n	Take care.
<stuff deleted>\n\n\nGood gravy! Decibels are all *ratios.* The question that remains in\nany ratio is the reference unit used. Sometimes, this will be a reference\npower, such as 1 milliwatt (given a certain circuit impedance which\nshould also be included in the fine print or known, like 50 ohms\nin an RF circuit of that impedance), leading to an accepted\nnotation of dBm. Maybe it might be dBV, disregarding the impedance of\nthe circuit and power developed, using 1 volt as reference *amplitude*\n(rather than reference power). Or, it might have an arbitrary or omitted\nreference that is not included in the notation, leading to just plain dB.\nSo. look at it this way--'dB' has an implied reference while notation\nsuch as 'dBm' has an explicit reference.\n\nFor power:\n\n  dB = 10*log( P(measured)/P(reference) )\n\nFor amplitude\n\n  dB = 20*log( A(measured)/A(reference) )\n\n'B' is for bel, which is a standard term for a log ratio to the base\n10, named after Alexander Graham Bell. A 'deci' Bel is 1/10 of a bel.\nIt has nothing to do with the Bell Telephone company except for\nthe common founder's name. The small 'd'/large 'B' is per SI notation\nconvention. I don't know anyone that's been crucified for messing it up.\n\nCommon references for audio are:\n\n	0 dBm = 1 milliwatt across 600 ohms\n	0 dBV = 1 volt\n\n	0 VU (a zero on the VU meter) = +4 dBm  (pro gear line level)\n	0 VU = -10dBV	(consumer gear line level)\n\n\nOften times, a power amp VU meter will be aligned using\nthe rated power of the amp as the 0 dB point. It is all\ndone to whatever reference is reasonable for the application\nor moment.\n\nNote that in a circuit with a given (and maybe unknown) linear\nimpedance, if the amplitude goes up so many decibels, the\npower will also increase the same amount. This proof can be done\nwith the above two identities and ohm's law.\n\n-- \n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Dave Medin			Phone:	(205) 730-3169 (w)\n    SSD--Networking				(205) 837-1174 (h)\n    Intergraph Corp.\n       M/S GD3004 		Internet: dtmedin@catbyte.b30.ingr.com\n  Huntsville, AL 35894		UUCP:  ...uunet!ingr!b30!catbyte!dtmedin\n\n   ******* Everywhere You Look (at least around my office) *******

: My 9 yr old son has signed up to do a science report on batteries.  I was\n: wondering if anyone could provide me with some information as to how to\n: construct a home-built battery.  In my grade school days, I remember seeing\n: the 'ice cube tray' version, but I don't remember what to use as a good\n: electrolyte or what the easily obtainable metals were.  \n: \n: Thank you in advance.\n \nI remember watching a whole "Mr. Wizzard" program on this subject when\nI was a kid.  The battery constructed on the program which made the \nbiggest impression on me, and generated the most power, was made using\na galvanized bucket (for the zinc) and a copper toilet tank float.  The\nelectrolyte was sauerkraut!
You can get a *little* UV by putting a heavy UV filter (deep purple) in\nfront of an ordinary flashlight bulb (the brightest you can get).\nMy father used a setup like this in law enforcement work circa 1964.\n\nGood UV ("blacklight") bulbs work like fluorescent bulbs.  I'd proceed by\ngetting a cheap battery-powered _fluorescent_ light, then going to an\nelectrical supply house and finding a UV bulb that would fit it.

OK, I've asked this before, and with a new thread on these lines, I\nask this again:\n\n1: If a large hole current is run thru a resistor, will there be\n   I^2 * R cooling instead of heating?\n\n2: Can anyone design an amplifier that preferentially amplifies\n   hole currents over normal electron currents?\n\n3: what semiconductor materials have the highest ratio of\n   hole mobility to electron mobility? (please quote actual\n   test samples rather than estimates based on theory. Also,\n   don't be limited to semiconductors: consider also insulators,\n   resistors, dielectrics, piezo-electrics, conductors,\n   magnets (metal, ceramic), magnetostrictives, etc).\n\nNOTES:\n\n   to summarize, this thread has so far stated that the only area\n   where holes are not detectable is the vacuum. That is, hole\n   particles only exist in the presence of matter.\n   Previous threads have stated that holes only exist in certain\n   semi-conductors. The question that naturally arises is if\n   the hole currents inside a semi-conductor vanish at the point\n   where the semiconductor is joined to a conductor (say, copper).\n   I don't want a theoretical discussion here about whether\n   holes could exist inside metal conductors, rather I ask for\n   an experimental discussion on how to amplify and detect such\n   currents *if* they exist.\n   Also note that I have cross-posted this to sci.electronics\n   since this is now becoming an electronic discussion.\n\nThanx,\nEric.\n\n----\n ET   "A Force of Nature"

NASA and related agencies apparently used this same principles to create\nthe loudest reported reproduced sound.

Hello,\n\nI just canceled my support of the Cable Regime and I would like to at\nleast pick up the 3 networks and NBC.  :)   I do not have tons of\nmoney nor even a few pounds so what I am looking for is the best solution\nfor reception for under 100 dollars.  I have seen modules that you plug\ninto your wall outlet that "supposedly" make your entire house an\nantenna.  I have to admit, even with my limited knowledge of wavelength\nand aerial reception, this seems dubious in its claims for "excellent\nreception" at best.  I'll try anything, though, if it WORKS.  I am in\na non-mountainous area, approximately 50 miles from the transmitting stations\nwhich are pretty large (Montgomery Alabama pop. 200,000) and Colombus Goergia,\npop. 100,000+.  Any recommendations of products, brand-names, prices and \ncompany info (catalog ordering numbers, addresses etc.)?  Thank you in\nadvance.
[Note: I just tried to figure this stuff out about a month ago myself, from\nvarious people on the net, so I could be wrong.]\n\nThe data is only ever read once (barring mistracks and such, of course),\nand eventually gets turned into 44.1 KHz, 16 bit, two channel data.\nOversampling takes two discrete data points, and interpolates n-1 points\nbetween them for n times oversampling.  When I asked, people said that the\ninterpolation was not simply linear interpolation, but significantly more\ncomplicated.\n\nAnyway, then, the purpose of oversampling is to move the "effective"\nsampling rate up to n times 44.1 KHz, in order to use higher frequency\nantialiasing filters.  For the same quality filter, higher oversampling\nlets you build cheaper filters, whereas for the same price filter, higher\noversamplings lets you build better filters.  So, assuming the quality of\nall other components in a CD player remained the same, oversampling should\nallow a manufacturer to produce _slightly_ better sound due to anti-alias\nfiltering.
Hmm - I don't think you and I are thinking of the same thing. I was the\noriginal poster, BTW.

I was just wondering one thing, actually two. ( I hope that this is the\nproper place to post this subject)\n\n  Why does a lead acid battery discharge and become dead (totally unuseable)\nwhen stored on a concrete floor?  \n  I decided to bring the battery in from the lawn mower and the motorcycle\nfrom the unheated garage this year, *to preserve them* and I just\nwent to use them and noticed that not only do they not work, but \nthey act like the two terminals are shorted.  I asked a friend\nand he said that you should never do that, 'cause it ruins them,\nbut he couldn't tell me why.
Here in Erie, PA there is a system in the inner city called Rado-Lite (a \ntrade name) which allows police and ambulance vehicles to gain right of \nway by controlling traffic lights through RADIO signals.  The receivers \nlook much like what you describe, but they include a UHF whip antenna (less\nthan a foot tall) and a light which flashes on and off to let traffic know that \nan emergency vehicle has taken control and is approaching.  Local folklore \nsays this system was invented here; I don't know if this company has any \nother installations.  It has been in operation for at least 30 years, going \nonly by my memory.
: While driving through the middle of nowhere, I picked up KNBR, AM 1070,\n: a clear-channel station based in Los Angeles. They had an ad \n: claiming that they were able to get traffic flow information from \n: all of the thousands of traffic sensors that CalTrans has placed\n: under the pavement. Does CalTrans sell this info? Does KNBR have\n: an exclusive? What's the deal?\n\n: ==Doug "Former L.A. commuter" Claar\n\nYou were right the second time, it is KNX. Believe it or not, I also\nlisten to KNX in the evenings here in Colorado! It's kind of fun driving\nthrough the country listening to traffic jams on the 405. Back to your\noriginal question. Yes, there are sensors just past every on-ramp and\noff-ramp on the freeways. They're the same sensors used at most stoplights\nnow (coils in the pavement). You might want to give CalTrans a call or\neven ask Bill Keene (KNX's traffic reporter). I doubt if just anyone can\nget the information, but it would be worth asking just in case you can\nget it.
Why are you fooling around with analog for this job?  A single chip\nmicro and a crystal will do the job reliably and easily.  An 8748 only\ncosts about $5.  That and a $1 crystal and you're in business.  Embed\nthe whole thing in a foam insulated blanket, power it from a solar cell,\nuse the excess power to heat the assembly during the day and rely\non the insulation to hold the heat during darkness.  If you don't want\nto try thermal management, contact someone like ICL and have them cut\nyou a special low temperature crystal.  It'll cost at most $20.\n\nIf you use a single chip micro, you're looking at a parts count of \nmaybe 7.  A processor, a crystal, two caps on the crystal, a power FET\nto fire the solenoid a flyback diode and a battery.  This is fewer parts than \nyou can build an analog timer for and is infinitely more reliable.  Add\na power zener diode (for heat) and a solar cell and the parts count\nscreams up to 9.\n\nPD assemblers are available for all the common single chip micros.  This\napplication is so trivial you could even look up the op codes in the \nprogrammer's guide and create the binary with a hex editor.\n\nJohn

Imprecise. This description\n\n 1. ignores the role of the ballast,\n 2. misrepresents the heating effects in the starter.\n\nThe bimetalic strip cools down immediately after the contacts\nshort circuit, because the neon discharge stops, and much less\nheat is generated from the I^2R loss in the metal as compared to\nthe neon discharge.\n\nThe starter contacts open before the tube fires.  Actually,\nthe tube fires as a result of the back-emf generated in the ballast\nbecause of this immediate opening of the starter's contacts.\n\nA capacitor is connected in parallel with the contacts to prevent\nexcessive arcing during the firing.  The neon reionizes but does not draw\nsufficient current to prevent firing of the tube itself.

Since your MOSFET is a 1972 vintage, it's probably not a very good one by \ntoday's standards.  If you have an idea about its voltage and current \nratings, e.g. 60VDC @ 6A, you can probably get away with replacing it with \nanything with better specs.  Early MOSFETS had a gate-source voltage rating \nof approximately +/- 20 VDCmax, and they would usually turn completely "ON" \nat +10VDC.  Otherwise, MOSFETS are not really mysterious -- they're more or \nless voltage controlled current sources.  If the MOSFET in your circuit is \nused as an open-loop, voltage controlled current source, you may have to \nexperiment with various gain-altering techniques.

I am looking for information on infra red based position encoders.\n\nThe idea would be to bounce the infrared source off a wall and the device would\nread out the distance.\n\npreferable it would be rs-232 addressable.\n\n\n\nAny leads?

In making batteries you could use copper and zinc in an acid electrolyte.     \nCopper=copper wire (pennies are now mostly zinc if I recall correctly)\nzinc= zinc strip (Hardware stores arround here (Seattle) sell this to prevent\n      moss buildup on the roof.

This is a followup post to something I've written previously.  Several\npeople responded with good information, but I don't think I communicated \nexactly what I am looking for.\n	I'm working on a custom I/O device that will communicate with a host\nvia RS-232.  My custom circuitry will use an 80C186EB or EC CPU and require\nabout 64K of RAM (preferably FLASH RAM).  In looking around, I see that lots\nof people have engineered UART-CPU-ROM-RAM subsystems that are ready to be\ninterfaced to your custom I/O devices.  It's been done so much, that it \nwould be best if I can avoid reinventing a system.  It just needs to use\nan 80C186 (or 188) CPU, and be able to load a program from the host then \ntransfer control to that program.  Well, there's one other thing the ROM\nneeds to know how to do.  It should have routines to send and receive bytes\nto/from the host, that utilize the hardware control lines (DTR,RTS,DTS,CTS).\nEverything I've seen is in the $200.00 and up range.  That's too much for\nthis application.  I need something around $100.00.  The CPU has the UART\nbuilt-in, so you're only looking at a few chips.  Does anyone know a \ncompany that markets a good board in this range, or some public domain \ncircuitry I can use?  Thanks in advance for the info.
The point is that the original poster was talking about connecting\nground and neutral in the *outlet* box (big NO NO), and you are talking\nabout them being connected in the breaker box (as things should be).\n\nIf this is not obvious, the point is that there should be current\nflow in the white, i.e. neutral/return wires when things in the\nhouse are operating.  There should not be any flow in the ground wires\nunless there is a fault condition.  Notice also that in the breaker box\nthere is a wire leading from the above-mentioned junction to earth ground,\nusually a pipe or spike driven into the ground.
Yes, but in a fairly reproducible way. -40 is only a smidgen of the\ndistance to absolute zero. And in any case you're going to have to\nborrow freezer space from a bio lab or someone to test/calibrate this\ndarling anyway. Btw, you're probably going to want those big capacitors\nyou found to fire the solenoid -- High current drain on frozen batteries\ncan be an ugly thing.
Back in the 70's I was a service technician for a cash register company.\nThe cash registers used microprocessor circuits and back then they were\nVERY susceptible to electrostatic discharge and line noise.  The biggest\nproblems came from outlets that were not properly grounded.\n\nIn almost every place we went to do an installation, we found outlets\nwith the ground connected to the neutral.  For 99.9% of the things you\ncan plug into one of these, they work fine.  For our cash registers they\nwere a nightmare -- line noise tended to scramble the memory\nperiodically.\n\nWith modern electronics using switching power supplies this should be\nless of a problem.  Even the company I used to work for is no longer\nrecommending a dedicated line with a seperate ground for their\nequipment.  I imagine if you check MOST household wiring you will find\nthat the ground and neutral are connected.  Although not ideal, it\nshould be o.k. for most applications.\n\n---\n . SLMR 2.1 .

: My next project is to come up with an IF/detector module for fast -- 112\n: to 250 kB/sec -- packet radio use.  No fancy modulation scheme, just\n: wide FSK for use at 902 or 1296 MHz.\n\n: I'm a bit familiar with the Motorola 3362 chip, but I wonder if there\n: are newer designs that might work at higher input frequencies.\n\n: My goal is to come up with an inexpensive design for a receiver "back\n: end" with IF input on one end and an FSK demondulator on the other.  I'm\n: particularly interested in ways to use a higher IF than 10.7 -- do any\n: current chips work up to, say 150MHz with internal downconversion so a\n: normal IF filter can be used?\n\n: Any suggestions?\n\n: John\n\n  What you describe is very close to what I built and described in the\n10th ARRL Computer Network Conference proceedings.\n\n  I built 10 watt FSK transceivers at 904 MHz.  They are essentially\ndouble conversion transverters with digital mod and demod at 29 MHz.\nThe receiver uses the MC13055 which is the same FSK receiver chip I used\npreviouslyu in the 2 Mbps 10 GHz data link I first published in Ham\nRadio and which is now also in the ARRL handbook.\n\n  The MC3356, which includes a VHF converter section, could also be used\nat these speeds.  There is a newer and perhaps slightly improved design\nof this (the MC13056 if I remember rightly).\n\n  While using this would have let me reduce the "external" IF count on\nreceive, it didn't really offer all that much help on transmit so I\ndidn't bother with it.\n\n  The radios I built were first designed and built for 512 kbps in a 2\nMHz channel but later reduced to half that.  These 256 kbps radios\nactually have done quite well in across-the-bench tests at 384 kbps and\nspeed is pretty much a function of filter design.  Handling the data\nstream is another matter entirely.\n\n  Some of the existing radios are currently deployed on hilltops in a\n"beacon" test mode.  While there is not yet end-end two-way data flow\ndue to lack of resources to debug software for the digital hardware (MIO\nalso shown in the CNC proceedings), data is perfect copy at n6gn.  Even\nthough the data clock is currently at about half speed, the a 2+ kbytes\nof the test text (chapter 55 of Isaiah) takes only a little over 1/8 of\na second.\n\n  I've been hoping that someone would get interested enough to step in\nand get involved in writing code to make the whole thing usable (Borland\nIDE environment with remote debugging possible as mentioned in the\nproceedings) but to date a couple of us have been on our own and running\nlow on resources of time, money and energy.\n\n  If anyone in the SF bay area wants to check it out there is also a CW\nID after the text on the mark side at 904.740 MHz from beacons on Sonoma\nMtn and Black Mtn (overlooking Si valley).  The antenna is horizontally\npolarized.\n\n  I guess in retrospect my suggestions are that this is a fairly costly\napproach if the radios are intended for users rather than backbones and\nyou might want to carefully consider your "target".  If you can't\narrange your paths such that you have complete line-of-sight I think\nyou'll want to address the inter-symbol-interference caused by\nmultipath and probably link C/N budgets if paths are very far from LOS.\nFor more details, see the 10th CNC.  I'm currently working on a spread\nspectrum, direct conversion design to address some of these problems.\nI'd be glad to help as I can with any design problems.\n\n73\nGlenn Elmore n6gn
Hey all:\n\nI just moved to NYC and wondered if there are any electronics hackers\nout there who could point me to places in NYC that sell individual\nelectronic components (switches, pots, transformers, caps,\ntransistors, etc.)  "Radio Shack" doesn't count (they have almost no\nselection, and their prices are outrageous!)\n\nI have particular interest in audio components (amplifier IC's, power\nMOSFETS, output transformers, tubes and tube sockets, pan pots,\nfaders, etc.)\n\nI have checked out a lot of 48th street and Canal street so far with\nno luck.

It sounds like your TV is one of the ones that also reacts to the video \nprotection.  (Poor you!)\n\nThe Macroscrubber from Radio Electronics removes the protection so you \nsouldn't have any more problems.  However, if you use the method of \ncopying it from one VCR to another where the second VCR doesn't react to \nthe protection, you will end up with a duplicate tape, including the \nprotection.\n\nOne thought comes to mind about your problem...  When playing the tape \nfor viewing, are you feeding the signal from the source VCR through an \nextra device before going to the TV?  If you feed it through a second VCR \nfirst, that is your problem.  As to other devices such as converters, I \ndon't know if they would react or not.  Just to be safe, you might want \nto make sure that you have NOTHING between the VCR and TV.

There SHOULD be a connection of the GROUND wire to a ground\nin the breaker box.  There also should be a connection of the NEUTRAL\nwire to a ground in the breaker box.  There should be no other \nplace in the building where such a connection occurs (i.e. not in\nany of the outlet boxes).\n\n	The NEUTRAL (white) wire is a 'grounding conductor' for\nthe plug, and is NOT safe to touch, while the GROUND (green)\nwire is a 'protective ground' and carries no current unless\nsome kind of electrical fault has occurred.  It's safe\nto touch the protective ground, but not to touch the \ngrounding conductor (because there is current in the grounding\nconductor, its outlet-box end will not be at the same ground\npotential as its breaker-box end).

Yes, you increase the RPM slip of a "boxer" type fan by installing\na capacitor in series with the fan's power supply.  The air flow of\nsmall 3.5 inch fans can be reduced by about 50% by using a 1 to 4\nuF capacitor.  Use a good grade nonpolarized unit with working\nvoltage rating around 250 volts.  Note that some impriical study is\nusually required to experimentally determine the best size\ncapacitor for a given application.\n\nFor DC powered applications, try the Radio Shack 12 volt box fan.\nIt can run and start reliably from as low as about 4.5 VDC.  It is\nexceptionally quiet, but at admittedly low flow.  I wish I knew who\nmade the fans for Radio Shack.

Here's the scoop.  When you get your home brew receiver working, would\nyou be willing to share it with the rest of us?  I always wanted to\nbuild my own but never have the time to fool around and design it.\n\npin 1:  signal ground\npin 2:  signal\npin 3:  always hot +6 volts\npin 4:  +6 volts, hot only when preamp is turned on\npin 5:  infrared repeater connectors\n\nThe infrared repeater jacks on the back of the preamp are not connected\nto anything inside the preamp except the 5 pin connector pin #5.  There\nis a 150 ohm resistor between the two jacks, with a 1.5K from pin 5 to\nground.\n\nThe signal pin #2 in the preamp is summed with the built in IR receiver.\nThey use a chip called CX20106A and a BJT to amplify the signal.  I would\nimagine the logical way would be to duplicate this circuit and use\nit as the external receiver.\n\nIf you need more info, let me know.
FYI:  The actual horizontal dot placement resoution of an HP\ndeskjet is 1/600th inch.  The electronics and dynamics of the ink\ncartridge, however, limit you to generating dots at 300 per inch.\nOn almost any paper, the ink wicks more than 1/300th inch anyway.\n\nThe method of depositing and fusing toner of a laster printer\nresults in much less spread than ink drop technology.\n\nIt doesn't take much investigation to see that the mechanical and\nelectronic complement of a laser printer is more complex than\ninexpensive ink jet printers.  Recall also that laser printers\noffer a much higher throughput:  10 ppm for a laser versus about 1\nppm for an ink jet printer.\n\nSomething else to think about is the cost of consumables over the\nlife of the printer.  A 3000 page yield toner cartridge is about\n$US 75-80 at discount while HP high capacity (~500-1000 page yield)\ncartridges are about $US 22 at discount.  It could be that over the\nlife cycle of the printer that consumables for laser printers are\nless than ink jet printers.  It is getting progressively closer\nbetween the two technologies.  Laser printers are usually desinged\nfor higher duty cycles in pages per month and longer product\nreplacement cycles.

A verrrrrry long time, like on the order of days.  I had the pleasure of\ndoing that once (playing with the speedo cable) and with my B&D heavy duty at\nfull speed (600 rpm) all the speedo ever got up to was 30 MPH.  Now if you go\na high speed drill and ran it at say 4000 rpm, you could get 200 MPH out of\nit.  (If you speedo doesn't burn out.)  Anyways, to roll a 100000 Mile\nodometer would take 22 days or so.  Much easier just to take the speedo\napart.\n\nThought I'd share.  BTW, all this info was obtained legally  :-)
Thanks for the resposes as they were all good ideas and I am looking at using a\ncouple of the ideas. I recieved in the mail today the spec sheets on the mil.\nspec version of Exar's XR-2240 timer/counter chip. It is stable down to -50 C\nand sucks very little power. They show an application for a ultra-long time\ndelay (up to several years depending on the RC time constant). In this\napplication, they have two of them cascaded together. The reset and trigger\npins of both chips are tied together and the timebase of the second chip is\ndisabled. In this configuration, the output is high when the system is reset.\nWhen triggered, the output goes low and stays that way for a total of 65,536 x\nthe timing cycle of the first chip. The total timing cycle of the two chips can\nbe programmed from To = 256 x R x C to 65,536 x R x C in 256 steps by selecting\nany combination of the counter outputs to the timer output. The beauty of it\nis, the timebase chip would only have to have a 100uF timing cap and a 391K\nresistor for 39.1 seconds per timing cycle. So I can get a maximum of\n2,562,457.6 seconds between timing cycles (39.1 x 65,536 or about 29 days !)\nOf course, that's much more than I need (14 days). But the counter allows for\n256 binary steps that can be selected for the output for the 'pellet puker'.\nAfter the first 14 days and it trips, it would reset its self for the next 14\nday timing cycle and so forth.\n\nPower is still a problem though. A few ideas that you suggested was to bury the\nelectronics in a hole dug in the snow (as an insulator) and put the pellet\npuker up on a tower above the estimated snow fall with a solar panel on it to\nkeep a charge on a lithium battery pack. I like that idea ;-) This thing has to\nwork for at least six weeks for three samples and the gas valves are 12 volts\nto spit the pellets out onto the snow. Anyway, I ordered the XR-2240's to see\nwhat I can do with them. Should be interesting (as long as I'm not the one that\nhas to go digging up the pellets in the middle of Antartica freezing my buns\noff ;-)\n\nThanks again everyone...
Well, I've now been working on this DAMNED stepper controller board\n since 9pm.  It's now 6am... I'm pissed off.  Period.  Alright, I can\n drive the steppers through the 3479P's; no problem (that's with the\n 6-wire steppers, 2 to +, and the other 4 are the phase lines).  Problem\n 1:  I've got some 4 wire steppers.  I put the darkest line to + and the\n other 3 to the 3479P... worked, kinda.  Tried it with a printer stepper\n (moves the head back and forth, 4 wires), didn't work too well.  It \nwould\n shift back and forth (use something like a 4017 instead?)  Also I've \nbeen\n trying to get a bunch of NPN's to work with it... NO LUCK... tried \nPNP's,\n still NO LUCK!!!  I don't know if I'm cursed on this or what, but I feel\n my brain slowly frying with the thought of STEPPER ... ARGGG!!!\n         I don't know what's wrong with the transistor hook-up (to-220 \npkg\n type), also tryed the 2n2222-pkg type... no luck.\n\n                         I'm going to try getting some z's, and I hope \nyou\n can help me with this problem.\n   If someone can please help me with this soon, it would be greatly\n   appreciated...\n\n                 Thanks.\n\n\n\n\n \n  _________________________________________________\n  Inspiration  |   ___                             |\n  comes to     |  \   o  baden@sys6626.bison.mb.ca |\n  those who    | (  ^  ) baden@inqmind.bison.mb.ca |\n  seek the     |   /-\      =] Baden de Bari [=    |\n  unknown.     |                                   |\n  -------------------------------------------------
So-Called Cool-Hot boxes have been advetised for several years.  I recall\nDamark advertising them in a recent catalog.  Problem with the units is they do\na sh***y job of keeping food cold/warm.  The peliter devices used just don't\nseem to have enough punch to keep up.  If you want something hot, you need to\nheat it up before you put it in the box, and end up hours later with food thats\nonly moderately warm.  Same goes for cold items.\n\n\n You'de probably be better off getting a good Coleman(tm) cooler and stocking\nup on "blue ice" blocks.\n\n Same as above.  Not enough "punch" in them to keep/get things cold/hot.\nMike Behnke             | Senior Tech/Advisor | Quid est illuidin aqua??\nFermi Nat Accel Lab     | Equipment Suuport   |\nBatavia, Il.            | Computing Div       | PISTRIX!!

I had a similar idea, for a fax/answering machine switch,\nto put both machines on one line.  You order distinctive\nringing from your phone company.  This is $3/month here.\nYou get a second (unpublished) phone number.  When\nsomeone calls this number, your phone rings with short\nrings instead of long rings.\n\nYou set up your answering machine on 4 rings and your fax\non six rings.  You'd give out the new # as your fax #.\nA device would measure the length of rings.  When it\ndetects a short ring, it turns off your answering machine.\nFive rings later your fax picks up the call.\n\nThis should be cheaper and more elegant than the $80\nswitches now available.\n\nBut that's not what I did.  I'm giving out the new\n# to my friends and customers.  This should leave the\nold # for telemarketers, etc.  I won't pick up the\nphone when I hear the long rings.

Hi,\n\n   I've just built a valve preamp and use a diode/capacitor\nvoltage multiplier to step the 12vAC supply voltage up to approx \n260vDV. As the load resistance increases, the RC constant decreases\nand hence the output voltage drops. I need as high an output\nvoltage as possible. (about 260v).\n  The circuit consists of seven voltage multiplier stages\n(ie 14 diodes and 14 capacitors) each capacitor develops about 38v\nacross them, and I take the output from across seven capacitors=260v.\n  Each capacitor is 100mfd at 68v.\n If I increase each of the capacitors rating (220-470mfd), that will\nincrease the RC constant, and hence alleviate some of the problem.\nThese capacitors are going to be a little expensive as I need 14 of\nthem, So:\n\n1. What would happen if I connected a 470mfd at 400v capacitor in parallel \nwith the output (and hence in parallel with the seven 100mfd capacitors)?\n  Will it, as I assume, increase the C in circuit and hence increase\nthe RC time constant? If it does, and my output voltage becomes more\nstable by doing this, then I will have killed two birds with one stone...\nas I am experiencing some 50Hz ripple (and hence amp hum), and this new\ncapacitor will 'smooth' this out.\n\nand\n2. Can anyone recomend a suitable value for an inductor (choke) to\nbe placed in the output line of the power supply to filter out\nthe 50Hz mains hum. Lowest resistance possible !\n\n  I've not got my preamp with me at the moment because it is TOO MUCH\nof a distraction.... (I'm at university and I've got to get my \ndissertation finished in two weeks !!!!!!!) hence I'm mailing not\nplaying with my solderoing iron (it'll be cheaper too in the long\nrun... especially if 14 new large capacitors don't work as planned!)\n\nEmail please.... Can't always read the net.....\n\nThanks in advance..\n\n\nChris ;-)\n\n  +====================================================================+\n  |Name : Mr Chris Smith       |     Twang on that 'ole guitar !       |\n  |Addrs: scst83@uk.ac.liv.csc |                                       |\n  |Uni  : Liverpool University |Quest: To build more and more hardware |\n  |Dgree: Computer Science     |                                       |\n  +====================================================================+\n\n "What ever the sun may be, it is certainly not a ball of flaming gas!"\n  -- D.H.

Does anyone know if a source for the TCM3105 modem chips (as used in the\nBaycom and my PMP modems)?  Ideally, something that is geared toward \nhobbyists:  small quantity, mail order, etc.\n\nFor years, we've been buying them from a distributor (Marshall) by the\nhundreds for PMP kits.  But orders have dropped to the point where we can\nno longer afford to offer this service.  And all of the distributors I've\nchecked have some crazy minimum order ($100, or so).\n\nI'd like to find a source for those still interested in building PMP kits.\nAny suggestions?
I suggest that misc.consumer.house is a better forum for this, several\nelectricians, a huge FAQ that adresses ALL the issues raised here.\n\n--
This probably only tells you that the DC blocking capacitor that's in series\nbetween the one-chip, single-ended audio amp and the speaker terminal is there.\n\n\nOpen it up and look for the power amp "ICs".  They'll be fairly obvious. \nReplace the one connected to the dead output. \n\n\nWell, one thing you should do is poke around the terminals of the power amp\nchips.  Use a probe with a 10M resistor (like a scope probe) connected to the\ninput of a small audio amp w/speaker.  If you find line-level input to both\nchips, one of the chips is bad and can probably replaced pretty easily.  \n\nIf you want to pick off a near-line-level signal, suitable for feeding to an\noutboard amp, the outer legs of the volume control pot will often be good\nenough.  This is *before* the volume control (and usually before the tone and\nbalance controls too).  If you take off from the center and ground legs of\nthe volume pot, this will be after the volume control (but again, probably \nbefore the other controls).  \n\nIf the unit is a modern type with an electronic volume control chip, you should\nprobably forget the whole thing.
Not recommended. Your circuit would take too much current, when\ntelephone is on-hook. Telephone company does not like it.
Actually, fossil fuel plants run hotter than the usual \nboiling-water reactor nuclear plants.  (There's a gripe in the industry\nthat nuclear power uses 1900 vintage steam technology).  So it's\nmore important in nuclear plants to get the cold end of the system\nas cold as possible.  Hence big cooling towers.  \n\n       Oil and gas fired steam plants also have condensers, but they\nusually are sized to get the steam back into hot water, not most of the\nway down to ambient.  Some plants do cool the condensers with water,\nrather than air; as one Canadian official, asked about "thermal \npollution" de-icing a river, said, "Up here, we view heat as a resource".  \n\n       Everybody runs closed-cycle boilers.  The water used is \npurified of solids, which otherwise crud up the boiler plumbing when\nthe water boils.  Purifying water for boiler use is a bigger job than \ncooling it, so the boiler water is recycled.
Here's something I posted about this a few years ago.  It's not fully\nup to date with all the new variations (some of which are just different\nmanufacturer's synonyms):\n\n------\nIn practical terms, ignoring the technological details, this is my view\nof the families (NB I am not a giant corporation, which influences my\nviews on things like availability and backward compatibility):\n\n74	The original.  Speed good, power consumption fair.  Effectively\n	obsolete now; use 74LS or later, except for a *very* few oddball\n	functions like 7407 which are hard to find in newer families.\n\n74H	Modification of 74 for higher speed, at the cost of higher\n	power consumption.  Very obsolete; use 74F.\n\n74L	Modification of 74 for lower power, at the cost of lower speed.\n	Very obsolete; use CMOS.\n\n74S	Later modification of 74 for even higher speed, at some cost in\n	power consumption.  Effectively obsolete; use 74F.\n\n74LS	Combination of 74L and 74S, for speed comparable to 74 with lower\n	power consumption.  Best all-round TTL now, widest variety of\n	devices.\n\n74F	Fast as blazes, power not too bad.  The clear choice for high\n	speed in TTL.  Availability and prices generally good.\n\n74AS	Failed competitor to 74F, although a few 74AS parts do things\n	that are hard to find in 74F and thus are still useful.\n\n74ALS	Possible replacement for 74LS.  Generally souped up.  Still fairly\n	new, availability and prices possibly a problem.\n\n74C	Fairly old family, CMOS devices with TTL pinouts.  Competed with\n	4000 series, not too successfully.  Obsolete; use 4000 or newer\n	CMOS 74 families.\n\n4000	(Thrown in as the major non-74 non-ECL logic family.)  The old CMOS\n	family, still viable because of *very* wide range of devices, low\n	power consumption, and wide range of supply voltages.  Not fast.\n	Very forgiving and easy to work with (beware static electricity,\n	but that comment applies to many other modern logic families too).\n	There are neat devices in this family that exist in no other.  The\n	clear choice when speed is not important.\n\n74HC	A new attempt at 74-pinout CMOS.  Fast compared to old CMOS, power\n	consumption often lower than TTL.  Possibly a good choice for\n	general-purpose logic, assuming availability and affordability.\n	CMOS logic levels, *not* TTL ones.  Beware very limited range of\n	supply voltages compared to older CMOS, also major rise of power\n	consumption at faster speeds.\n\n74HCT	74HC with TTL logic levels.  Much the same comments as 74HC.  Read\n	the fine print on things like power consumption -- TTL compatibility\n	in CMOS involves some compromises.\n\n10K	(Thrown in for speed freaks.)  The low end of ECL.  Various sources\n	claim that it is *easier* to work with than super-fast TTL for\n	serious high-speed work.  Less forgiving, though:  read and follow\n	the rules or it won't work.  Availability to hobbyists limited,\n	can be expensive.\n\n100K	(For real speed freaks.)  Hot ECL.  Harder to handle than 10K, and\n	inconvenient packages.  Much more useful datasheets, however.\n\nAs for compatibility between families:  the 74 families (except 74C and\n74HC) are all more or less logic-level compatible, but how many 74X devices\nyou can drive from one 74Y output varies enormously with X and Y.  You just\nhave to read the specs and do the arithmetic.  74C and 74HC are compatible\nwith the others with a bit of hassle.  4000 compatibility can be a bit of\nhassle or a lot of hassle depending on what supply voltage 4000 is using.\n10K or 100K to anything else is considerable hassle.\n\nMe?  I use 4000 and 74LS with a sprinkling of 74F.  74HC[T] and 10K are\ninteresting but I haven't used either significantly yet.
Howdy chaps\n\nHas anybody got any pointers to good C, Pascal, etc compilers for \nmicrocontrollers, shareware or otherwise ?\n\nMy specific need is for 8051 C, but if the responses are many and varied I \nwill post a summary.\n\nCheers\nMike

<lots more deleted>\n\nI think the hangup with digital scopes is that you have to know so much\nmore about them and how they work on a scope-by-scope basis, and\nsome of the functions are typically presented, in my opinion,\nin a counter-intuitive fashion (HP has made some strides in their\n54600 series, IMO). Automatic setups are fine for simple,\nrepetitive waveforms, but can give you some crazy results on more\ncomplex events where you need to understand how the scope is\nactually measuring/processing the event. For example, is the scope\nin "equivalent time" or in "real time" sampling mode (equivalent time\nbeing a mode where samples are built-up slowly by adding a delay to\nthe trigger event each sweep)? What was the scope's actual sampling\nrate at the time? How is the data being massaged after capture but\nbefore display, etc. One common misconception is the speed of the scope.\n\nIs the HP scope you're using really a 100 MHz scope? Or is it a 20 MHz\nsample rate scope (~5 MHz single shot significance) whose front\nend including S/H can support 100 MHz waveforms (important for\nequivalent time sampling)? The 100 MHz input in this case really\nonly helps you when your waveform is repetitive, or on a single\nsample, when you get lucky and hit a transient event during a sample time.\n\nSo, there are a lot more variables in understanding how to get\nuseful information from a digital scope. I prefer an analog scope for\ngeneral use and the digital for events where I need storage for\nlater analysis or comparison, when the event is within the capability\nof the scope. Now, for the price of true 100 MHz digital scopes to\nfall...\n\n-- \n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Dave Medin			Phone:	(205) 730-3169 (w)\n    SSD--Networking				(205) 837-1174 (h)\n    Intergraph Corp.\n       M/S GD3004 		Internet: dtmedin@catbyte.b30.ingr.com\n  Huntsville, AL 35894		UUCP:  ...uunet!ingr!b30!catbyte!dtmedin\n\n   ******* Everywhere You Look (at least around my office) *******
Yeesh, you WILL be nailing those IRLEDs.  May I suggest getting your\nmitts on the Siemens SFH484-2 IRLED?  This unit is designed to take some big\ncurrent pulses if you can get your duty cycle down a bit.  It will output\nnearly a watt (975 mW) with REAL short duty cycle times.\n\n(nice thing about the SFH484-2 is that it is CHEAP.  I got mine for about\n50 cents a piece, even though I had to buy 100 of them....)\n\n	BTW, I have seen IRLEDs with outputs up to 6 watts...honest,\n6 WATTS.  I don't have the book here at work so I can't recall the company\nname.  The 6 watter ain't cheap, around $108 but if you want some power,\nmamamia, that's pretty hot.

The actual hourglass is hollow and is designed to generate a draft,\nexploiting the venturi effect.  Around the base of the hourglass is a\nring of water towers.  Warm river water, coming from the steam condenser\nin the plant, is sprayed over louvres.  The draft being pulled through\nthe tower cools the water by both evaporation and convection.  The\nsensible heat extracted from the cooling water is the driving force for\ndraft generation.\n\nIt should be noted that the hourglass-shaped cooling towers are used on\nboth fossile and nuclear plants.  It should also be noted that at \nlocations where water is plentiful, the cooling towers are only used part\ntime, when the discharge temperature would exceed some release limit.\nIt was once thought that the warm discharge water was damaging to fish.\nFishermen know that is thoroughly incorrect.  Nontheless, stringent,\nusually state, regulations remain in some instances.  Since it typically\ntakes 60,000 hp worth of pumping to move the volume of water needed \nto cool a 1000 MWe plant, the cost of using the towers is not insignificant.
Not even in sub panels!  The only place the neutral should be connected to the\nground is in a SERVICE DISCONNECT!  In your house the "main" panel serves as\nthe service disconnect.  Sub panles in your garage or workshop for example must\nmaintain seperate neutral and ground busses because they are not  service\ndisconnect equipment.

Greetings!\n      \n        Situation:  I have a phone jack mounted on a wall.  I don't\n                    know the number of the line.  And I don't want\n                    to call up the operator to place a trace on it.
And the Commonwealth of Virginia has not exactly butted\nagainst the issue on those grounds.

Yet.
For an upcoming project I want to use 4 Megs of DRAM configured as two 2\nMeg banks of 16 bit data.  I was wondering if anyone out there knows of a\nDRAM controller which will handle refreshing the data.  It's ok if the\ncontroller doesn't handle bank switching - that part is easy.\n\nThe only controllers I know of are the ones out of the National\nSemiconductor DRAM Management Handbook (1988 edition) eg. DP8429.  I would\nlike to know if another manufacturer produces one which may be easier to\nimplement in my circuit.\n\nBTW, if anyone is wanting to hook up DRAM to a microcontroller, Dallas\nSemiconductor makes a neat chip: the DS1262 Serial DRAM Nonvolatizer\nChip.  It uses the SPI (I2C) bus and refreshes/controls up to 16Mx1 of DRAM\nmemory.  It can use an external battery to refresh the DRAM when the\npower is off.  Price is $11.75 from Dallas (quan 1).  I wish I could use\nthis chip but its maximum SPI clock rate is 1 MHz (too slow for me...).\n\nThanks in advance,\n\nWayne Schellekens\n<schellew@wu2.wl.aecl.ca>
The only explanation I can think of is that two capacitors in series\ncan handle twice the output voltage. Sometimes two elco's in antiseries\n(you know, positive sides facing eachother) are used to obtain a large\ncapacitor that can handle positive and negative voltages as well.\n\nSo there probably is no design-philosophical reason, but a production-cost\none.\n\nBest 73's
Hi all,\n I've been following this thread about jacob's ladder for a few weeks and I\nhappened to come across one of the best project books that I've seen in a \nwhile.  The book "Gadgeteer's Goldmine" by Gordon McComb offers over 55 \nexcellent low cost projects including: Jacob's Ladder, tesla coils, plasma \nspheres, a Van de Graaff generator, robots, an IR scope, and several laser \nprojects.  The instructions come with complete part lists, warnings and \ndiagrams.  For those of you who are interested in building any of the above \nlisted projects, you should seriously consider getting this book.  The \npaperback version is only $19.95 too.\n\nFor those who want more information:\nTitle: Gadgeteer's Goldmine!  55 Space-Age Projects\nAuth:  Gordon McComb\nPub:   TAB Books\nCW:    1990\nISBN:  0-8306-8360-7\n	0-8306-3360-X (paperback)\n Price: $19.95 (paperback)\n\n -Scott

I'm no expert at UPS's, but you said something that made it sound like\nyou didn't realize something.  On a typical UPS (well, on ours, anyway),\nthere is NO switchover from AC to DC.  All the protected equipment is\nALWAYS running from the batteries (via an inverter), with the usual \ncondition of also having them on charge.  If the power fails, big deal - \nthe computers never see it (until the batteries start to droop, but \nthere's something like 60 car-sized batteries in that cabinet, so it \ntakes a while).\n\nIf you were gonna run the guts on straight DC instead of an inverter,\nwhy not do it all the time?  Then there'd be no switchover to screw\nthings up, and no having to sense the failure fast.  Just keep the DC\non charge when the power is on, and it'll be there in zero time when\nyou "need" it.
: The PADS*.ZIP files contain subdirectories, and have to be unzipped\n: via "pkunzip -d". Then an xcopy /s to three floppies creates the disks\n: needed to do the install.\n\nI'm still not sure how this is supposed to work, since the .ZIP files\ntook up about 2.5Mb, so it must be a tight squeeze on those floppies...\n\nHowever, I managed to install PADS and I'm pretty impressed.  I created\na couple of schematics without problem, but whenever I try to \ncreate a PCB layout from one of *my* circuits (rather than the demos)\nit doesn't work.  I'm wondering if maybe a file isn't where it should\nbe...\n\nCan anyone who has a printed manual comment on whether the registration\nfee is worth paying?\n\n\nChris
Yes, you could.\n\n\nWell, letsee (whipping out HP-48SX, soon to be GX): 6 inches/3*10^8 m/s=.5\nnanoseconds resolution.  Hmm.  That'll be rather difficult!\n\nThe more standard (read: better) method is to use ultrasound, generally\nsomewhere around 40kHz.  Sound travels a heck of a lot slower than light\n(radio waves), and is therefore much easier to deal with.\n\n\nIt might be easiest to visit a hardware store and look at the numerous\n"sonic estimator" type devices that do what you want here.  Many are pretty \ncheap too -- <$30.  (In fact, for awhile the Stanley Estimator was selling\nfor something like $8.  That's the one I bought! :-) )

You can learn how to build a deyhdrator very easily from the book, "The\nHungry Hiker's Guide to Good Food," by Gretchen McHugh.  The heat source\nis a 100 watt light bulb.  Basically, it's a vertical wooden box with\nventilation holes in the top and bottom (lots of them, you want the air\nto flow).  The light bulb goes in the bottom, and wire cake racks are\nspaced every 6" starting about 10" above the bulb.\n\nOr, at a slightly higher cost in electricity, you can do what I do:  Use\nyour oven.  (NOTE - I do this in an electric oven; some gas ovens may\nnot have a low enough setting).  Put food to be dried on cookie tins or\nracks in the oven.  Set oven to 140 degrees (the lowest setting on my\noven - if yours goes down to 120 that's probably even better.)  Stick a\nwooden spoon or something across the front corner of the oven and close\nthe door on the spoon so that it stays open about an inch - this allows\nfor airflow.  Leave the stuff in the oven for 6 to 8 hours; check it\noften, since this dries it much faster than the dehydrator.  If you are\nusing cookie sheets instead of racks, turn the stuff over halfway\nthrough.\n\nIf you want more info, e-mail me since this isn't really the right sub\nfor this stuff.\n\ngerald.belton@ozonehole.com\n\n\n * SLMR 2.1 * I still miss my boss, but my aim is improving.

Hmmmmm....\n\nSure, I didn't mean to imply that because of the heat generated, the\n  amp sounds good.  My Adcom GFP 535II runs fairly warm - not hot to\n  the touch - but enough to satisfy me that the amp is running nicely.\nI don't like it when an amp runs dead-cold.  It makes one think that\n  the amp is doing nothing :)\nThe heatsinks that Adcom uses in their amps are certainly far for\n  skimpy - they're massive things with heating vents both below\n  and above.  More than enough to carry away excessive heat.\n\nMy opinions once again.

Might be a good idea...  The resolution you requested is about 0.3mV\nIn order to get what you've paid for, noise level better be lower than\nthat.  It is kind of hard to do it in a noisy box like you can expect\ninside a PC.\n\nBefore you pay $$$ for a PC card, test it out by sampling a low\ndistortion sine wave (I think there is a sine wave on a CD.  Digital\nDomain ?  There are possibly other low THD sources)  Run the digitized\nwaveform through a FFT transform and take alook at the noise floor on\nthe spectrum.  That's should give you a good indication of the design.\n(That's what I am doing to test a data acquistion system I have designed\n- I got the idea from MAXIM data sheet.)\n\nIf you can live with 14 bit resolution, I would recommend looking at\nthe MAX121 from MAXIM.  It is a high speed (308KHz) complete\nsampling A/D with DSP interface.  The input range is +/- 5V and it\nuses a serial interface (which can easily be optically isolated\nfrom the computer to elinimate a major noise source)  The Analog design\nguide I got from them shows a -100db noise level.  They claim a -77db\nmax (-85 typ.) THD.  Looks pretty good for the $12 @ 1000 pieces\n\nA evaluation kit is available.  Might want to give these nice folks a\ncall.  1-800-998-8800 or fax: (408)737-7194 and (408) 737-7600 ext4000\nfor application assistance.\n\nThis assumes that you can build your own DAS and write your own software.\n(Hey you can get the MAX121 as a free sample just by calling the 1-800 #)\n\n\nI would recommend you to find out the resolution that can be gotten out\nof your system by looking at the noise level, otherwise you might be\nthrowing out your money.\n\n\nK.

[...]\n\nI think you posted your article 15 days too late :-)) April 1st is over.\nI don't like nuclear powerplants but i think it's not fair to tell such\n"storys" about them. OK ?\nLet me try to explain what that tower is used to:\n   -1st. Even the modernst nuclear powerplant is only a simple steam-engine.\n         It has an hightech "boiler" but the rest is still verry verry \n         conventional. And if you've already visited any condensation-\n         powerstation you'l have seen the cooling towers too.\n         If you look at any good book about thermophysics you'll find\n         a chapter about the "CARNOT-process" which describes how to\n         get energy from a temperature difference ! And that is the reason\n         for cooling towers too !!! You only can get energy if you've an\n         temperature gradient. That means that you have steam on the one \n         side and need to cool down the steam 'till you get water\n         again on the other side if you want to get aprox. 30% of the \n         energy you (or better the uranium) brought into the water to\n         let it boil. If you only have hot steam on the one and "cold"\n         steam on the other side you'll loose much more of the energy.\n         And so they cool down the steam to get at least the 30% of\n         energy that carnot will give them.\n         The cooling towers are for cooling the steam !\n         The vapor you'll see is NOT the steam of the main core circulation,\n         because that steam is radioactive ! The circulation is divided in\n         AT LEAST 2 circuits connected about heat exchangers to prevent\n         radioactive pollution of the environment !\n         \n   -2nd. OK, the main core IS hot, but even in the modernst HighTemperature-\n         Reactors (HTR) they only run at ~800 deg celsius. This is still\n         verry far away from uraniums melting point which is somewhere\n         around 2000 deg. celsius ! But you'll have lot's of problems with\n         the boiler's steel. That's because at this temperature the\n         metal is attacked by steam and will corrode verry fast.\n         This is only for BWR's. The new He cooled reactors have temperatures\n         up to 1200 deg. celsius. But this is only experimental. \n\n   -3rd. I personaly think that nuclear waste should be as low as ever\n         possible because the dose you get will accumulate about the\n         years. Today 1 mRem and next year 0.5 mRem won't be 0.75 mRem\n         at all. It accumulates and even in 80 years you'll still have\n         1.5 mRem. And i'm not interested in glowing in the night and\n         getting children with 2 heads. This is my point of view.\n         \n\nOnly my 0.02$ !\n\nChristian Reisel \n\nstudent of electronic sciences\n\n-- \nChristian Reisel, Goldammerweg 2, W-6601 Buebingen, Germany\nVoice        +49 6805 22179 Fax & Email  +49 6805 22179\n\nPGP PubKey:

Hi people..\n\nOK heres my problem.... \nI keep hearing about these little credit card type of things which\ndetect IR light....\n\nI believe that you have to 'charge them up' under normal (visible) light\nand then if they are exposed to IR light they glow or something like\nthat...\n\nI think that they are avaliable in the states and even in England, but\nalas I live in Australia.  Could someone please inform me if I can get\nthese things over here, and if so where??? and how much???\n\nAlso are they really commonly avaliable in the states, and if so, then\nhow much are they and who sells them (maybe if I cant get one here, I'll\nwrite to one of the companies over seas..)\n\nAnyway....

I think there is a huge difference in the materials and \nprocess for printer/toner PCB's. I get first time, everytime\nresults from a local HP Postscript, and hardly ever works from\ncopies of the same artwork. The printer results are so good\nthat I have quit even looking for PC board processes. If I had\nto use the copier version, I would think I would look elsewhere.\nThe moral? Experiment and find what works. Toner transfer CAN\ngive excellent results. It, like any process, gives erratic \nresults with variable inputs.
Is there a fast 'n dirty way to kill the line spiking that occurs when\nan inductive load is turned on sometime other than at zero-crossing of\nthe AC cycle?  A capacitor kludged in somehow, etc?\n\nI've got a microcontroller that is running a bunch of valves and pumps\nin a big instrument washer, and almost everything is being switched with\nzero-crossing solid state relays, so that stuff stays "quiet", AC-wise.\nBut there's one steam valve that gets turned on by a mechanical relay\nin the water tank fill/thermostat system, and it's not under control\nof my SSRs, and it does sometimes generate/radiate a spike that resets\none of my peripheral chips.  My software times out and tries again, but\nI'd love to just tack in a magic spike-killing fix that would avoid having\nto do some major rewiring/redesign.  A varistor would help but might not\nbe sufficient.  Ideas?

Sounds like the picture tube lost vacuum.  This would cause the filament\nto ignite and could actually turn the tube from a vacuum to a pressure\nvessel, followed by an explosion when the neck assembly (mostly likely\ncracked to begin with) blows off.  During the whole sequence of events,\nthe other circuits may continue functioning, which accounts for not\nlosing sound.

{early PA?}\n# I recall reading of a phonograph which used mechanical amplification.\n# Compressed air was squirted out of a valve which was controlled by the\n# pickup.  The result was noisy and distinctly lo-fi, but much louder\n# than a conventional phonograph.  It tended to wear the disks out\n# pretty quickly though.\n\nAn now-deceased prof told us willing students about a project he had\nworked on during WWII.\n\nThey needed a mega-power PA with very clear audio quality. The purpose\nwas to bellow at refugees from aircraft.\n\nTheir solution was a giant compressed-air source, and a horn with\nparallel shutters worked by a small audio system. I think he said it\nworked very well, thus the War Dept. cancelled the project ;_}.

First of all, realize that Tesla invented AC power generators, motors,\ntransformers, conductors, etc. Technically, *ALL* transformers are Tesla\ncoils.  In general though when someone refers to a Tesla coil, they mean\nan "air core resonant transformer". The TV flyback version Tesla\ncoil (see the _Encyclopedia_of_Electronic_Circuits_ V3, 106-1 for\ndiagram) has NOT an air core. It is of a class of circuit called\n"Oscillating Shuttle Circuit" (OSC). Generally OSC's are highly\nefficient, but this version uses transistors and resistors,\nwhich are very lossy devices. Typically Tesla used active\nreactances instead of passive resistors, so that he could achieve\nefficiencies of 99.5%, and better. The usual application of an air-core\nresonant transformer, or of an OSC, is to produce strong EMI\nfor wireless broadcasts. How well do you think your computer\nscreen would work if we removed the HF HV Tesla (flyback) coil\nfrom it? If we were to remove from our homes and industries all\nTesla coils, our lights would go dark, our cars would sputter\nand die, our radios would go silent, our industries would grind\nto a halt, and we would have to go back to using coal for heat,\ngas for lamps, horses for transportation, steam for power, and\ntelegraph for communication. Is that real world enough for you???????\n\nGET THE MESSAGE! WE WOULD NOT HAVE 1/100 THE CONVIENIENCES WE HAVE\nTODAY IF NOT FOR TESLA. GIVE CREDIT WHERE CREDIT IS DUE!\n\nIf it had been up to Edison, we'd still be in the 19th century.\n(flame me at your own peril. I'm very good at putting edison down).\n\n----\n ET   "Tesla was 100 years ahead of his time. Perhaps now his time comes".

Actually detecting a BREAK is done by watching for a "character" containing\nall zero bits with the framing error resulting from its receipt.  This\nmeans that the line stayed in the zero bit state even past the stop bit\ntime slot, which basically indicates a BREAK.  There is no special way to\ndetect BREAK that I have found other than this -- there's no magic signal\ngenerated by UARTs, etc.

Hello, \n\n   Let me introduce a problem:\n\n   When I measure a sinusoidal wave (voltage) with a digital voltmeter, using \nAC mode, my output is an rms value (a peak value over 2 squared). / Right? / \n   When I measure a square wave in the same mode (AC), my output is equal \nto a peak value, actually, to the upper flat boundary of the wave.\n   I assumed, that a digital voltmeter makes some kind of integration of the \ninput value, and divides it over the wave period. / Right?/\n   Now, I used it to measure the same  square wave as above, but distorted \nby high-frequency harmonics. Ideally, output should be the same, but...\nThe output value was only about 10% of the previous one! \n   Why? What is the nature of this output value? What does the voltmeter \nactually measure? And what does it show?  \n\n   Related question (less important to me):\n   What are advantages and disadvantages of digital voltmeters to compare with \nanalog ones? \n\n   Thank you for your attention, you could mail me your opinion at\navm1993@zeus.tamu.edu or open a discussion here. I would appreciate either \nway.\n\n\nAlexander V.

I live in the San Francisco Bay Area, and word has it that\nsomething similar is on its way here.  Since we apparently\ndon't have the sensor base you folks have, they're installing\ncameras at strategic points along the freeways (initial tests\nare going to be in the Santa Clara area I'm told), with the\nvideo being piped into a command center they're building\nsomewhere in the East Bay.  I'm not sure if frame grabbers or\ncheap labor will be used to interpret the data, but large\nmulti-colored status displays will show the various routes\nusing different colors to represent the various average speeds\nfor each stretch of highway.  An announcer will sit in front\nof the status 'wall', and will relay continuous verbal traffic\nstatus to those who want to receive it.  They're apparently also\nlooking into licensing a low-AM frequency to be dedicated to\nproviding continuous audio from this system.\n\nIn the mean time, they'll set up large incandescent display\nboards along the test stretch to provide commuters with data\non traffic conditions up ahead.  My understanding is that the\nsystem is subsidized as a pilot program, and information from it\nwill be available free of charge.  Perhaps the LA system is\nsimilarly free or provided at an obviously subsidized rate (read\n"cheap").\n\nWe also have the traffic reports that are broadcast on the SAP\naudio channel of television channels 2 and 36.  These are verbal\nreports, qualified with a identification tone to tell in-vehicle\nreceivers like the 'Auto Talk' that the information coming next is\napplicable to a given area.  In LA, they're probably using some\nother TV channels, but the concept is the same.  Try setting your\nstereo TV or VCR to receive the SAP audio channel, and go station\njumping to find out which one is broadcasting this information.\nI believe this program is also subsidized, making the in-vehicle\nreceivers cheap to purchase (and without having to incur monthly\nfees to use it).  Since the makers of these in-vehicle receivers\ndon't have to pay for the broadcast (this may not be completely\ntrue), they likely have no investment in keeping the system\nup and running when the Cal Trans stuff hits the airwaves.  You\nmay have a nifty little TV audio receiver in your car, nothing\nmore, when this happens.  Perhaps a word to the wise...?  ;)\n\nI think we'd all be interested in a summary post if you get more\ninfo on how the LA system is networked and paid for.

There are two more reasons to save old databooks and then beyond two\nyears--obsoleted parts and better application notes and tutorials.\n\nWhen a part is dropped from future production planning, such as the\nNational MM-series white noise generators, camera sync generators, etc.,\nit will disappear from current databooks although it still may be produced\nfor a short time (or be available from stock somewhere).

Bubblejets often splatter a little bit, whereas LaserJets (given half-way decent\ntoner, like HP's "Microfine" stuff) don't.  Both produce very good output,\nbut you don't have to look too closely at the two to tell that LaserJet\noutput is definitely superior.  \n\nOn the other hand, LaserJets which haven't been maintained properly and use\nthe cheapest toner the owner could find often produce awful output, much\nworse than a bubblejet. :-)\n\nOne other thing... there are bubblejets, and then there are BubbleJets.\nThere are a few bubblejets out there that produce rather mediocre output\n(such as HP's dinky little BubbleJet), whereas most produce really good\nlooking output (such as HP's DeskJets).

I would be interested in hearing from anyone who knows of good software for\nantenna simulation, particularly in source form suitable for Unix workstations\n(though good PC software would also be of interest).\nI'm aware of the numerous mininec mutations, and have been using MN for\nsome time now.  I'm primarily interested in HF, VHF, and low UHF (< 500 MHz)\ndesigns, mostly wire antennas, but for thick wires and mesh surfaces as well\nas for your basic thin wire assumption.\nIs anything interesting happening with NEC itself?

Hi all,\n\nI'm an assistant manager at a local art theater here in Columbus.  I'd\nlike to expand our show automation a bit- namely add the capability to\nuse cue tapes to bring the houselights up.  Our current automation\nconsoles date from the early 60's and don't provide this function.\n\nWe already have the combo failsafe/contact rollers to read the cuetapes,\nand our dimmer system will raise the houselights when its fade-up control\ncircuit (120 VAC) is momentarily closed, for at least 0.5 second.\n\nI've tried wiring the dimmer control to a 12V relay, activated when the\ncue tape completes the circuit.  Low tech and simple, but there's one\nproblem:  In order to get the 1/2 second pulse, there needs to be\na sh**load of cuetape on the film.  (35mm runs at 90 feet per minute,\nso to get a 1/2 second pulse, there needs to be at least 9 inches of solid\ncuetape!)\n\nIdeally, I would like to use a single cross-cue to accomplish this function.\n(A single strip of cuetape perpendicular to the length of the film)\nThis would give a pulse of approximately 1/100 of a second.\nWhat I need is a circuit to detect the short cue and activate the relay\nfor around 1/2 second.  The ability to adjust how long the relay\nis activated would be nice.  I figure this would require an RC circuit\nof some sort.  I'm sure some of you already have the solution figured\nout in your heads.  Any suggestions and schematics would be appreciated!\n\n\nThanks,\n\nMark Fontana
I have a spare Fluke 8062A.  This is a true RMS digital meter with\n4.5 digit display.  It's in "average" condition (been used) but \nworks fine - which is what Fluke's are all about.   BTW - according\nto the fellow who designed these meters, they can be converted to 8060A\nfunction by clipping a jumper, and adding the 2 extra switches..\nLike I said $115 seems fair - these sell for $300+ new.

The rule for the designations is that if it says MC, that means it works\n*exactly* the way the datasheet/book specifies.  If it says XC, that means\nthere is at least one known bug.

Not hard, you can do the refreshing and access cycles by software, but\nthis hogs most of the available CPU cycles on a low-end controller.\nI've seen some application note from Philips that used one of their\n8051 derivatives as a printer buffer, with up to 1MB of dynamic ram\nthat was accessed and refreshed with software bit-banging.\n\nAnother alternative would be to use one of those nice DRAM controller\nchips that "create static RAM appearance" and all that, but they may\nbe too expensive to make it worthwhile.
This may sound like a simple-minded question, but this is the first time\nI've ever had a need for this:\n\nI've been designing some relatively simple chip circuits based on things\nlike photoresistors (you know, no light to photoresistor, emit a logic\nhigh, etc.).\n\nAnyway, I've got some servos lying around, and I wanted to do some things\nwith them using digital logic.  I know all about having to pulse the signal\nand everything, I just have one problem:  I'm assuming I need a negative\n(yes, negative) logic high to get the thing to turn in the direction \nopposite the direction it would turn under normal logic high.\n\nIs a negative logic high (I've seen this in schematics) the same thing as\nan active low, or what?  I'm not using a bi-polar power source, so how\nwould I get a negative logic high out of this thing?  I need to have all\nthree signals available:  Logic high, logic low, and negative logic high.\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated.  Also, please reply via email, as I\nnever seem to have time to read this (or any other) group lately.\n\nThanks much,\n-mark
Look at the 4053.  This is a triple 2-to-1 transmission-gate analog\nmultiplexer, with positive and negative power supplies (can be run\nfrom a single-ended supply as well).  With dual supplies, the logic\ninputs still range from ground (0 Volts) to VDD.\n\nThis is a neat (well, I think so) design for a switchable-polarity\namplifier:\n\n                 +-----/\/\/\-------+\n                 |                  |\n                 |    /--------\    |\nINPUT -+-/\/\/\--+----| -      |    |\n       |              |  opamp |----+------- OUTPUT\n       +-/\/\/\--+----| +      |\n                 |    \--------/\n                 |\nCONTROL	---------X (analog switch)\n                 |\n                 |\n                ---\n                GND\n\nAll resistors are equal-value.  When the analog switch is closed,\nthe amp is inverting-gain-of-one.  With the switch open, it is\nnon-inverting-gain-of-one.  You can clean up the circuit to trim\nout input offset current if this hurts the balance (this would show\nup as carrier feed-through).\n\nFor high frequencies, the slew-rate of the opamp might cause problems,\nespecially if it isn't symmetrical (and it usually isn't).
I have a stereo compressor-limiter by \nAudio Logic (Model MT-66).

I've found this works pretty well on noisy laminated power\ntransformer cores and windings (the 60Hz kind). Likewise, if\nanybody has tried this on a flyback I'd like to hear about it.\n\nI would suspect it would not be as effective as it was on power\ntransformers as the material wouldn't damp as well--something\nI suspect would be critical at the frequencies involved (in other\nwords, you want absorption rather than prevention which would be\nreal difficult at 15 KHz).\n\n-- \n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Dave Medin			Phone:	(205) 730-3169 (w)\n    SSD--Networking				(205) 837-1174 (h)\n    Intergraph Corp.\n       M/S GD3004 		Internet: dtmedin@catbyte.b30.ingr.com\n  Huntsville, AL 35894		UUCP:  ...uunet!ingr!b30!catbyte!dtmedin\n\n   ******* Everywhere You Look (at least around my office) *******

I've had my Fluke 8060A here at work for just over 10 years now.\nIt is a wonderful meter.  Several colleagues here have some of the\nnewer Fluke meters, though I still would just as soon hang on to my\n8060.  The 8060 a is the 1980s digial "analog" to the Simpson 260\nanalog DMM of the 1950-1960s.  There was/is (?) an 8060B that had\nextended frequency response.\n\nI've got a nifty little pen shaped meter made by Soar that I keep\nin my toolbox at home.  I've had that for six or seven years now\nand only replaced the batteries a couple of timees; it is more than\nadequate for day-to-day hobby use.  I think Soar OEMs their stuff\nfor a number of vendors.  Some of JDR Microdevices' stuff looks\nrather similar to Soar's.

Also, exact part\nnumbers/company names etc. for the relays will help!\n\nThanks!

I have a Fujitsu M2322K which has been removed (I believe) from a digital\nX-Ray machine (takes X-Ray pictures without film).  The Fujitsu part number\nis B03B-4745-B002A.\n\nI have obtained some data on the device, it is 8-inch winchester-type\nof 168 megabyte capacity (though I was told it was over 800 megabytes).\nHowever, there is very little information on the interface standard used.\nIt appears to use two balanced-line connections, but what each connection\ncorresponds to I know not. One connection is a 30-way IDC, the other a\n60-way IDC.\n\nIf anyone has any information on this device, I would be most grateful\nif you could provide it.\n\nThanks.\n\n\nChris Powell.

They require two separate grounds.  One ground goes to the ground pin\nof the outlet, and the other ground wire is connected to the outlet's\nmounting tabs (and thus grounds the box and faceplate screw and metal\nfaceplate, if any).\n\nThe box/faceplate ground goes to the normal distribution panel ground.\nThe outlet ground-pin wire is generally connected to an insulated\nbusbar in the distribution panel which is, in turn, connected to\nthe building-entrance main ground by its own wire.

No, it is independent of the speedometer. The gun processes two doppler\nreturns--the speed of the car relative to the pavement and the speed\nof the target, taking the difference between the two.

I used its contents and references to defend myself against a bogus\nradar-measured ticket.

Uh oh...\n	Umm, there are a number of copy protection schemes.  Some involve\nmodifying the physical media, and some involve encryption schemes, &c.\n	All of the ones that have existed over the course of computing have\nbeen successful for a time.  I recall, however, near monthly releases of new\nways to "crack" the copy protection scheme of the latest releases.  The fact\nis, none of them are completely secure, or anywhere near it.  Some are more or\nless difficult to crack, and some have already been cracked.\n	I guess what I am saying is that your question is difficult, if not\nimpossible, to answer.  What exactly do you want to know?  Do you need a good\none for a project you are working on?  How secure must it be?  Are you trying\nto crack one that someone else has used?  I can probably make suggestions,\nassuming the activity is strictly legal.  (In general, it is a BAD idea,\nlegally, to tamper with copy protection.  It can also lead to corruption of\nfiles which you necessarily do not have back ups of (being as they are copy\nprotected,) which can be devestating.)  Do you have absolutely no ideas for\npractical applications, and are merely curious?\n	Please clear up those questions, and I'll try to help as much as I\ncan.\n\n	Incidentally, the "Uh oh..." at the top is indicative of the dread\nanyone who has watched their friends hacking equipment be carted off feels\nwhen they are asked how to hack.  The area you are broaching is wrought with\ndangers, many of which include breaking the law, or at least addressing it\n(from one side or the other.)

Paul,\n\nUnfortunately, there are not too many retail outlets that'll stock\njust about every chip made.  The stuff they will stock are the ones\nthat'll sell, like standard DRAM's, 80386's, 68000's, etc,etc.\ni.e.  I cna't think of any 'one-stop-shopping' store.\n\nThe closest you can get is to pick up a copy of Byte magazine or\nthe Circuit Cellar, Popular Electronics, and the like and flip\nthrough them.\n\nDistributors like Wyle Electronics, Hamilton Avnet, Pioneer Electronics,\netc, etc, don't normally deal with end-users like ourselves where\nwe only a couple of everything...they only deal with people who buy\nby the hundreds or more.  Each distributor represents and sells a variety of\ndifferent non-competing manufacturers.  What do I mean by this?\nSuppose ABC Electronics sells Intel 80386's.  It's a pretty good\nbet that they won't be selling any of AMD's 386's, or vice-versa.\nThey also can obtain just about *any* chip you want from a manufacturer\nthey represent.\n\nWho knows?  You might be lucky to be able to buy from one of them.\nBut I'd be suprised if you do.  ALso bear in mind that the 1 or 2\nqty prices they will charge you will be *much* greater than what\na mail order outlet will charge.\n\nMy advice?  If you're gonna be designing anything, try to stick\nwith off-the-shelf stuff.  You're going to get stuck if you use\ntoo many esoteric parts sooner or later.\n\ngood luck,
In Texas (Well, Corpus Christi anyway) if you pick up the phone and dial\n890 the phone company will read back the number to you.\nTry it. It might work.
Recently, my video monitor went dead, no picture, some low distorted sound.\nI didn't hear the tell-tale cracking that indicated HV at work, nor are the\nfilaments at the far end of the tube glowing orange, just nothing.\n\nOn examining the power board, I noticed the largest capacitor with a very\nbad bulge at the top.  Naturally, I want to replace it, but I can't find\nany sources.\n\nThe electrolytic capacitor is 330 mF at 250WV.  It has radial leads, and is\nroughly 1 1/2 inches long, 1 1/8" wide.  The dimensions are important since\nthe whole board fits in a metal cage, leaving little room.\n\nLiving in the Los Angeles area, I've been to numerous stores (Dow Radio,\nAll Electronics, ITC Elect, Sandy's, Yale Elect) with empty hands.\n\nCan anyone suggest sources for high-voltage capacitors?  Mail order is \nfine, although I'd rather check out a store to compare the can.  I'm going\nto try a video electronics store, hopefully they'll have HV caps.\n\n(By the way, the monitor is a ATARI SC1224, Goldstar circuitry, Masushita\ntube.  Anyone else had problems?)\n\nThanks in advance,\nRich K.

First, it will not pass a National Electrical code inspection.\nSecondly, The neutral wire is current carrying and the ground wire\nshouldn't be, or only during a fault condition.\n\nThe reason the neutral and ground are tied together in the panel is the\ntranformer on the power pole has a grounded center-tap secondary, with the\ngrounded center-tap the neutral.  This gives 120v to neutral(ground) from\neach side of the transformer and 240v across the transformer.  So in effect\nthe neutral and ground should be at the same potential. \n\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nMark E.

I have a new scope and I thought I'd save a few bucks by\nbuying one with a function generator built in. After having it awhile\nI noticed two things about the function generator. For one, there\nseems to be a bias even when the 'pull-offset' is pushed in. That is,\nI have to pull that know and adjust it to get a signal sans some\nrandom 50mV bias.\n	The other _really_ annoying thing is that the damn output\nwon't go below about 1V p-p. I am a student ( you may have guessed\nfrom my previous posts ), and I often have to measure the input\nimpedances of various circuits I build.Many of the circuits have\nmaximum input signals of way less than 500mV amplitude and most have\ninput impedances in the 10's of Kohm range. The thing is, in order to\nuse my function generator I have to divide the voltage to some thing\nreasonable. Then, of course, to measurethe input impedance of my\ncircuit I am going to have to throw in another resistor in series.\nWith the 50ohm output of the generator I could just ignore it, but now\nwith this little divider there I have to figure that in. It's kind of\na pain in  the ass.\n	Is there any way I could make myself a little box that could\nsolve this little problem. The box would tkae the function generator\ninput, lower the voltage and give an output impedance that is some\nlow, unchanging number. I would want to lower the voltage by a factor\nof one hundred or so. I could just build a little buffer amp, but I'd\nlike to have this box not be active.\n	Any quick ideas. The scope's not broken. For other reasons I\nhad sent it to the shop to get repaired and they replaced it. The\nfunction generator was the same way on that one, too.\n\n			please help as I am feeling very stupid \n			today,

Well, I'm not sure I'd use this to process a guitar but there was a audio\nfilter DSP construction article in the Sept 92 issue of QST magazine (Ham Radio\noriented).  The DSP is available in kit form for about $120.\n\nThis particular DSP filter was targetted toward processing audio to remove\nnoise (static).  I built it and it really works well.  The source code is\navailable too.  It makes a noisy audio signal much easier to hear.  Note that\nthis is for communication applications and is not "high fidelity".
What's the latest and greatest way to dim incandescent lamps ?\n\nMarch '93 Circuit Cellar has part one of an article about\ndimming 120VAC lamps, but it seems to lead into phase-\ncontrol as the best method for controlling brightness.\n  I've always hated phase-control for the RFI, buzzing\nfilaments and non-linear adjustment range. I had\nheard that you can modulate the AC line on a cycle by\ncycle basis to get better results.

If you're thinking of reactive polymers they're making ESD safe\ncontauiners out of it. As far as being conductive goes anything with\na resistance less than 10 to the fouthrth power ohms per cubic measure\nis classed as conductive per MIL-STD-1686 for ESD protection. My $0.02\n($0.016 US).
They detect the oscillator operating in the detector. Saw a story about\ntheir use in Canada. Now don't go putting oscillators in your cars... :-)

Just a few comments about the feasability of zipping up a bunch of miles\non your electronic odometer with an oscillator....\n\n    I wouldn't expect to be able to do this.  Not because the engineers at BMW are\nputting in anti-fraud logic, but just because an automobile is a noisy, hostile\nenvironment for electronics, and I would expect the software to be conservative.\n\n   If I were to design a microprocessor-based odometer/speedometer program,\nit would have the following features ( just off the top of my head ):\n\n         * Debouncing/deglitching  ( Is this a real pulse, or just a glitch? )\n         * Smoothing:  The rate-of-change of speed cannot be too high:\n                                This is a car, not an electron.\n         *  Top speed limit:  Anything above 200MPH is ridiculous: must be\n                                        electrical noise or contact bounce\n\n    As for getting in and presetting the pins:  if this is the circuit board out of\na BMW dashboard, I seem to remember a single big chip with lotsa pins in the\nmiddle of the card.  Good luck getting at the counter :-).\n\n    I wouldn't expect a high input frequency to damage the meter:  remember, it's\nprobably damped so it can't move too fast, and is probably protected.  After all,\na car is an extremely hostile place for delicate electronics;  there used to be an\napp note in the National Semiconductor Linear Databook that went into this\nin good detail.\n\n                               - Jerry Kaidor ( tr2!jerry@dragoman.com, jkaidor@synoptics.com )

As a general rule, no relay will cleanly switch audio if you try to tranfer\nthe circuit with the contacts.  The noise you hear is due to the momentary\nopening and closing of the path.\n\nThe noiseless way of transfering audio is to ground the circuit.  In high\nimpedance audio circuits a resistive "T" is constructed close to characteristic\nimpedance of the circuit.  Grounding the imputs (connected to the T) transfers\nthe audio.\n\nIn low impedance circuits transformers are usually used, and the inputs are\nshorted out or grounded.  Secondaries are paralleled at the characteristic\nimpedance.\n\nSometimes if it is necessary to actually switch audio, a second contact is used\nto momentarily short the circuit output for the duration of the switching time.\n\nTelephone relays are handy, because contacts can be adjusted to "Make before\nbreak and Vica Versa" but I haven't seen any of these for years.\n\nNowadys switching is done electronically with OP amps, etc.\n\nA novel circuit I used to build was a primitive "optical isolator".. It consists\nof a resistive photocell and a lamp, all packaged in a tube.  When the lamp is\noff the cell is high resistance.  Turn the lamp on and the resistance lowers\npassing the audio.  Once again this device in a "T" switches the audio.  Varying\nthe lamp resistance give a remote volume control.  Use 2 variable resisters and\nyou have a mixer!\n\nLots of luck!\n-- \n73, Tom\n================================================================================\nTom Wagner, Audio Visual Technician.

AllThe Devil ReincarnateSWR meter for CB radios\n\nTD>From: ssave@ole.cdac.com (The Devil Reincarnate)\nTD>Organization: CDAC, WA\nTD>What\nTD>is a good choice for a CB? 1/4 or 1/8 wave?\nTD>  I read the installation instructions on a 1/4 wave antenna,\nTD>and they suggested that I use an SWR to tune it at channel 12\nTD>and channel 32 for a minimum reading.  Question is, why channel\nTD>12 and 32?\n\nThe best antenna is one that will let out the most wave (probably not the \nbest explanation, but the rest makes sense) A one wave will cancell itself \nout (BTW no such beastie) . The best is a 1/2 wave antenna, followed by \n1/4, then 1/8 etc.\n\nAs for SWRing in, what you actually do is trim the antenna to the correct \nlength for the specific wavelength you will be transmitting on. Since the \nwavelength varies with the channel you use, then it's recommended to SWR \nin using the middle channel of those you are going to use.\nAnyway in the beginning of CB's, all new antennas had to be SWR'ed in, \nnowdays manufactures trim the antennas almost spot on, so that there's not \nmuch point in SWRing. Then again you may be a fanatic and whish to do it \nanyway.

This was the Pathe you are thinking of, although there were other imitators.\nIt didn't wear the disks any more than conventional acoustic designs, but\nit did have a high noise level due to the continual hiss of escaping air.\nThere are a lot of them still operating, and they are pretty ingenious.

I am making a search for a CAD program that does a decent job\nof making schematic drawings.  The program needs to be in\nMS-DOS, Windows if possible.\n\nWhat I want the CAD program to do is to draw diagrams by\ndragging elements onto the screen, and in this the elements\nneeded are as diverse as vacuum tubes to ICs (case with pins).\nIt also needs to have provision for adding legends to the\ncomponents as well as their values.  In other words I want to\nproduce quality drawings.  Printout would be to either 24 pin\ndot-matrix and/or Laser Printer.\n\nIf you know of such a CAD program that is of reasonable cost,\nplease respond.\n\nFred W.

Except for their size, the cooling towers on nuclear power plants\nare vertually identical in construction and operation to cooling\ntowers designed and built in the 1890's (a hundred years ago) for\ncoal fired power plants used for lighting and early electric railways.\n\nBasicly, the cylindrical tower supports a rapid air draft when\nits air is heated by hot water and/or steam circulating thru a network\nof pipes that fill about the lower 1/3 of the tower. To assist cooling\nand the draft, water misters are added that spray cold water over the\nhot pipes. The cold water evaporates, removing the heat faster than\njust air flow from the draft would and the resulting water vapor is\nrapidly carried away by the draft. This produces the clouds frequently\nseen rising out of these towers.\n\nThat slight pinch (maybe 2/3 of the way up the tower) is there because\nit produces a very significant increase in the strength and rate of\nthe air draft produced, compared to a straight cylinder shape.\n\nThe towers are used to recondense the steam in the sealed steam\nsystem of the power plant so that it can be recirculated back to the\nboiler and used again. The wider the temperature difference across\nthe turbines used in the power plant the more effecient they are and\nby recondensing the steam in the cooling towers before sending it\nback to the boilers you maintain a very wide temperature difference\n(sometimes as high as 1000 degrees or more from first stage "hot"\nturbine to final stage "cold" turbine).\n\n                                        R.

Now, that indeed is possible.  A good friend of mine is running about 1 KW\nPeP from his car.  Yes, he does have a second alternator.  Yes, he calls\nthe rig an "electronic brake" since the engine noticeably slows when the\nkey is down.\n\nMy car, unfortunately, has so much computer junk under the hood that it's\nastonishingly sensitive to RFI.  If I key a 2W HT over the engine with\nthe hood open, the car loses timing due to the RF leaking into the \ndistributor pickup.  Very poor design.\n\nI will, however, point out that ham radio operators are usually quite willing\nto help when interference is detected.  Remember that any interference is\nwasted power; if I put out 1W in the TV band, that's 1W that I am not putting\nout in the band I am trying to transmit on, and 1W can often be the difference\nbetween a nice card hanging on the wall, and nothing.  CBers, however, are\nusually not as helpful.  Most illegal CBers, however, will stop operation\nwhen you inform them of a problem.  The rest of them will stop operation when\nyou inform the local FCC office of the problem (in writing, and giving details\nand addresses).

Old style wiring\n	Where do I buy stuff?\n\n\nSubject: Introduction/Disclaimers\n\n	Although we've done a fair bit of wiring, we are not\n	electricians, and we cannot be responsible for what you do.  If\n	you're at all uncertain about what is correct or safe, *don't\n	do it*.  Contact someone qualified -- a licensed electrician,\n	or your local electrical inspector.  Electricity is no joke;\n	mistakes can result in shocks, fires, or electrocution.\n\n	Furthermore, our discussion is based on the U.S. National\n	Electrical Code (NEC) and the Canadian Electrical code (CEC).\n	To the best of our abilities, we have confirmed every detail\n	with the electrical code, but we don't quote sections\n	simply to keep this thing readable.  If you think we're wrong,\n	we invite you to correct us, but please - quote references!\n\n	The NEC and the CEC do not, in and of themselves, have the\n	force of law.  Many municipalities adopt it en toto.  Others,\n	however, do not.  Check your with your local building\n	department (and <provincial> Hydro Inspection Offices in\n	Canada) to find out what applies in your area.  Also,\n	your local electrical utility may also have special requirements\n	for electrical service installation.  Bear in mind, too, that\n	we say here applies primarily to ordinary single-family\n	residences.  Multi-family dwellings, mobile homes, commercial\n	establishments, etc., are sometimes governed by different\n	rules.\n\n	Also note that, contrary to popular belief in the U.S. (and in\n	some parts of Canada), Canada is not a wholly-owned subsidiary\n	of the U.S.  Consequently, the NEC does not apply in Canada.\n	Lots of things are the same, including voltages, line\n	frequencies, and the laws of physics.  But there are a number\n	of crucial differences in the regulations.  Where we can, we've\n	noted them, flagging the relevant passages with ``NEC'' or\n	``CEC''.\n\n	Remember that the CEC and NEC are minimal standards.  It is often\n	smart to go beyond their minimal requirements.\n\nSubject: What is the NEC?  Where can I get a copy?\n\n	The NEC is a model electrical code devised and published by the\n	National Fire Protection Association, an insurance industry group.\n	It's revised every three years.  The 1993 version has been released.\n	You can buy a copy at a decent bookstore, or by calling them directly\n	at 800-344-3555.  The code exists in several versions.  There's the\n	full text, which is fairly incomprehensible.  There's an abridged\n	edition, which has only the sections likely to apply to most houses.\n	And there's the NEC Handbook, which contains the ``authorized\n	commentary'' on the code, as well as the full text.  That's the\n	recommended version.  Unfortunately, there's no handbook for\n	the abridged edition.  And the full handbook is expensive --\n	US$65 plus shipping and handling.\n\nSubject: What is the CEC?  Where can I get a copy?\n\n	The Canadian Standards Association is an organization made up\n	of various government agencies, power utilities, insurance\n	companies, electrical manufacturers and other organizations.\n	The CSA publishes CSA Standard C22.1 which is updated every two\n	or three years.  Each province adopts, with some amendments,\n	this standard and publishes a province-specific code book.\n	Since each province publishes its own slightly modified\n	standard, it would be somewhat confusing to obtain the CSA\n	standard itself.  In this FAQ, "CEC" really means the\n	appropriate provincial standard.  In particular, this FAQ is\n	derived from the Ontario Hydro Electrical Safety Code, 20th\n	edition (1990).  Which is in turn based on CSA C22.1-1990 (16th\n	edition).  While differences exist between the provinces, an\n	attempt has been made to avoid specific-to-Ontario detail.\n\n	The appropriate provincial code can be obtained from electrical\n	inspection offices of your provincial power authority.  In\n	Ontario, it's Ontario Hydro.  The Ontario Hydro book isn't\n	overly fat.  It's about C$25, and includes mailed updates.  I\n	hear that these standards are somewhat easier to read than the\n	equivalent NEC publications.\n\n	Don't bother asking in Quebec - DIY wiring is banned throughout\n	the province.\n\nSubject: Can I do my own wiring?  Extra pointers?\n\n	In most places, homeowners are allowed to do their own wiring.\n	In some, they're not.  Check with your local electrical\n	inspector.  Most places won't permit you to do wiring on other's\n	homes for money without a license.  Nor are you permitted to do\n	wiring in "commercial" buildings.  Multiple dwellings (eg: duplexes)\n	are usually considered "semi-commercial" or "commercial".  However,\n	many jurisdictions will permit you to work on semi-commercial\n	wiring if you're supervised by a licensed electrician - if you can\n	find one willing to supervise.\n\n	If you do your own wiring, an important point:\n\n	Do it NEAT and WELL!  What you really want to aim for is a better\n	job than an electrician will do.  After all, it's your own home,\n	and it's you or your family that might get killed if you make\n	a mistake.  An electrician has time pressures, has the skills\n	and knows the tricks of the trade to do a fast, safe job.\n	In this FAQ we've consciously given a few recommendations that\n	are in excess of code, because we feel that it's reasonable,\n	and will impress the inspector.\n\n	The inspector will know that you're an amateur.  You have to\n	earn his trust.  The best way of doing this is to spend your\n	time doing as neat a job as possible.  Don't cut corners.\n	Exceed specifications.  Otherwise, the inspector may get extremely\n	picky and fault you on the slightest transgressions.\n\n	Don't try to hide anything from the inspector.\n\n	Use the proper tools.  Ie: don't use a bread knife to strip\n	wires, or twist wires with your fingers.  The inspector\n	won't like it, and the results won't be that safe.  And it\n	takes longer.  And you're more likely to stick a hunk of\n	12ga wire through your hand that way.\n\n	Don't handle house wire when it's very cold (eg: below -10C\n	or 16F).  Thermoplastic house wire, particularly older types\n	become very brittle.\n\nSubject: What do I need in the way of tools?\n\n	First, there's the obvious -- a hammer, a drill, a few\n	screwdrivers, both straight and Phillips-head.  If you're \n	lucky enough to live in Canada (or find a source of CSA-approved\n	devices) you need Robertson ("square recess") screwdrivers\n	(#1 and #2) instead of phillips.\n\n	For drilling a few holes, a 3/4" or 1" spade bit and 1/4" or\n	3/8" electric drill will do.  If you're doing a lot, or\n	are working with elderly lumber, we recommend a 1/2" drill\n	(right-angle drills are wonderful.  Can be rented) and\n	3/4" or 1" screw-point auger drill bits.  These bits pull\n	you through, so they're much faster and less fatiguing, even\n	in 90 year old hardwood timbers.\n\n	Screw-driver bits are useful for drills, expecially if you\n	install your electrical boxes using screws (drywall screws\n	work well).\n	\n	For stripping wire, use a real wire stripper, not a knife or\n	ordinary wire cutters.  Don't buy the $3 K-mart "combo stripper,\n	crimper and bottle opener" types.  You should expect to pay\n	$15 to $20 for a good "plier-type" pair.  It will have sized\n	stripping holes, and won't nick or grab the wire - it should\n	be easy to strip wire with it.  One model has a small hole in the\n	blade for forming exact wire loops for screw terminals.  There\n	are fancier types (autostrip/cut), but they generally aren't\n	necessary, and pros usually don't use them.\n\n	A pair of diagonal side cutter pliers are useful for clipping ends\n	in constricted places.  Don't use these for stripping wire.\n\n	You will need linesman pliers for twisting wires for wire nuts.\n\n	You should have a pair of needle-nose pliers for fiddling\n	inside boxes and closing loops, but it's better to form wire\n	loops with a "loop former hole" on your wire stripper - more\n	accurate.\n\n	If you're using non-metallic cable, get a cable stripper for\n	removing the sheath.  Or, do what some pros do, they nick the\n	end of the sheath, grab the ground wire with a pair of pliers,\n	and simply rip the sheath back using the ground wire as a\n	"zipper", and cut the sheath off.  You shouldn't try to strip\n	the sheath with a knife point, because it's too easy to\n	slash the insulation on the conductors.  Apparently Stanley\n	utility knives fitted with linoleum cutters (hooked blades)\n	can be used to strip sheath, but there is still the possibility\n	that you'll gouge the conductors.\n\n	For any substantial amount of work with armored cable, it's well\n	worth your while to invest in a rotary cable splitter (~US$ 18).\n	Hack saws are tricky to use without cutting into the wire\n	or the insulation.\n\n	Three-prong outlet testers are a quick check for properly-wired\n	outlets.  About $6.  Multimeters tell you more, but are a lot more\n	expensive, and probably not worth it for most people.  A simple\n	voltage sensor, which can detect potential through an insulated\n	wire not supplying any devices, is extremely helpful; they cost\n	about US$ 10 at Radio Shack.\n\n	You should have a voltage detector - to check that the wires are\n	dead before doing work on them.  Neon-bulb version are cheap ($2-3)\n	and work well.  If you get more serious, a "audible alarm" type is\n	good for tracing circuits without a helper.  (Though I've been known\n	to lock the drill on, and hit breakers until the scream stops ;-)\n\n	For running wires through existing walls, you need fish tape.\n	Often, two tapes are needed, though sometimes, a bent hanger or\n	a length of thin chain will suffice.  Fish tapes can be rented.\n\n	Electrical tape.  Lots of it ;-)  Seriously, a good and competent\n	wiring job will need very little tape.  The tape is useful for\n	wrapping dicy insulation in repair work.  Another use is to wrap \n	around the body of outlets and switches to cover the termination\n	screws - I don't do this, but drywall contractors prefer it (to\n	prevent explosions when the drywall knife collides with a live outlet\n	that has no cover plate).\n\nSubject: What is UL listing?\n\n	The UL stands for "Underwriters Laboratory".  It used to be\n	an Insurance Industry organization, but now it is independent\n	and non-profit.  It tests electrical components and equipment\n	for potential hazards.  When something is UL-listed, that means\n	that the UL has tested the device, and it meets their requirements\n	for safety - ie: fire or shock hazard.  It doesn't necessarily\n	mean that the device actually does what it's supposed to, just\n	that it probably won't kill you.\n\n	The UL does not have power of law in the U.S. -- you are\n	permitted to buy and install non-UL-listed devices.  However,\n	insurance policies sometimes have clauses in them that will\n	limit their liability in case of a claim made in response to\n	the failure of a non-UL-listed device.  Furthermore, in\n	many situations the NEC will require that a wiring component\n	used for a specific purpose is UL-listed for that purpose.\n	Indirectly, this means that certain parts of your wiring\n	must be UL-listed before an inspector will approve it and/or\n	occupancy permits issued.\n	\nSubject: What is CSA approval?\n\n	Every electrical device or component must be certified by the\n	Canadian Standards Association before it can be sold in\n	Canada.  Implicit in this is that all wiring must be done\n	with CSA-approved materials.  They perform testing similar to\n	the UL (a bit more stringent), except that CSA approval is\n	required by law.\n\n	Again, like the UL, if a fire was caused by non-CSA-approved\n	equipment, your insurance company may not have to pay the\n	claim.\n\n	In Canada, there is a branch organization of the UL, called ULC\n	(UL of Canada).  ULC does not have power of law, and seems to\n	be more a liason group between the CSA and insurance\n	companies.\n\nSubject: Are there any cheaper, easier to read books on wiring?\n\n	USA: The following three books were suggested by our readers\n\n	    Residential Wiring\n	    by Jeff Markell,\n	    Craftsman Books,\n	    Carlsbad CA for $18.25. ISBN 0-934041-19-9.\n\n	    Practical Electrical Wiring\n	    Residential, Farm and Industrial,  Based on the National\n	    Electrical Code    ANSI/NFPA 70\n	    Herbert P. Richter and W. Creighton Schwan\n	    McGraw-Hill Book Co.\n\n	    Wiring Simplified\n	    H. P. Richter and W. C. Schwan\n	    Park Publishing Co.\n	\n	Try to make sure that the book is based on the latest NEC\n	revision.  Which is currently 1990.\n\n	Canada: P.S. Knight authors and publishes a book called\n	"Electrical Code Simplified".  There appears to be a version\n	published specific to each province, and is very tied into the\n	appropriate provincial code.  It focuses on residential wiring,\n	and is indispensible for Canadian DIY'ers.  It is better to get\n	this book than the CEC unless you do a lot of wiring (or answer\n	questions on the net ;-).\n\n	It is updated each time the provincial codes are.  This book is\n	available at all DIY and hardware stores for less than C$10.\n\nSubject: Inspections how and what?  Why should I get my wiring inspected?\n\n	Most jurisdictions require that you obtain a permit and\n	inspections of any wiring that is done.  Amongst other more\n	mundane bureaucratic reasons (like insurance companies not\n	liking to have to pay claims), a permit and inspections\n	provides some assurance that you, your family, your neighbors\n	or subsequent owners of your home don't get killed or lose\n	their homes one night due to a sloppy wiring job.\n\n	Most jurisdictions have the power to order you to vacate your\n	home, or order you to tear out any wiring done without a\n	permit.  California, for instance, is particularly nasty about\n	this.\n\n	If fire starts in your home, and un-inspected wiring is at\n	fault, insurance companies will often refuse to pay the damage\n	claims.\n\n	In general, the process goes like this:\n		- you apply to your local inspections office or building\n		  department for a permit.  You should have a sketch or\n		  detailed drawing of what you plan on doing.  This is\n		  a good time to ask questions on any things you're not\n		  sure of.  If you're doing major work, they may impose\n		  special conditions on you, require loading\n		  calculations and ask other questions.  At this point\n		  they will tell you which inspections you will need.\n		- If you're installing a main panel, you will need to\n		  have the panel and service connections inspected\n		  before your power utility will provide a connection.\n		  This is sometimes done by the local power authority\n		  rather than the usual inspectors.\n		- After installing the boxes and wiring, but before\n		  the insulation/walls go up, you will need a\n		  "rough-in" inspection.\n		- After the walls are up, and the wiring is complete,\n		  you will need a "final inspection".\n\nSubject: My house doesn't meet some of these rules and regulations.\n	Do I have to upgrade?\n\n	In general, there is no requirement to upgrade older dwellings,\n	though there are some exceptions (ie: smoke detectors in some\n	cases).  However, any new work must be done according to the\n	latest electrical code.  Also, if you do ``major'' work, you\n	may be required to upgrade certain existing portions or all\n	of your system.  Check with your local electrical inspector.\n\nSubject: A word on voltages: 110/115/117/120/125/220/240\n\n	One thing where things might get a bit confusing is the\n	different numbers people bandy about for the voltage of\n	a circuit.  One person might talk about 110V, another 117V\n	or another 120V.  These are all, in fact, exactly the same\n	thing...  In North America the utility companies are required\n	to supply a split-phase 240 volt (+-5%) feed to your house.\n	This works out as two 120V +- 5% legs.  Additionally, since there\n	are resistive voltage drops in the house wiring, it's not\n	unreasonable to find 120V has dropped to 110V or 240V has dropped\n	to 220V by the time the power reaches a wall outlet.  Especially\n	at the end of an extension cord or long circuit run.  For a number\n	of reasons, some historical, some simple personal orneryness,\n	different people choose call them by slightly different numbers.\n	This FAQ has chosen to be consistent with calling them "110V" and\n	"220V", except when actually saying what the measured voltage will\n	be.  Confusing?  A bit.  Just ignore it.\n\n	One thing that might make this a little more understandable\n	is that the nameplates on equipment ofen show the lower (ie: 110V\n	instead of 120V) value.  What this implies is that the device\n	is designed to operate properly when the voltage drops that\n	low.\n\n	208V is *not* the same as 240V.  208V is the voltage between\n	phases of a 3-phase "Y" circuit that is 120V from neutral to any\n	hot.   480V is the voltage between phases of a 3-phase "Y"\n	circuit that's 277V from hot to neutral.\n\n	In keeping with 110V versus 120V strangeness, motors intended\n	to run on 480V three phase are often labelled as 440V...\n\nSubject: What does an electrical service look like?\n\n	There are logically four wires involved with supplying the\n	main panel with power.  Three of them will come from the utility\n	pole, and a fourth (bare) wire comes from elsewhere.\n\n 	The bare wire is connected to one or more long metal bars pounded\n 	into the ground, or to a wire buried in the foundation, or sometimes\n 	to the water supply pipe (has to be metal, continuous to where\n	the main water pipe entering the house.  Watch out for galvanic\n	action conductivity "breaks" (often between copper and iron pipe)).\n	This is the "grounding conductor".  It is there to make sure that\n	the third prong on your outlets is connected to ground.  This wire\n	normally carries no current.\n\n	One of the other wires will be white (or black with white or\n	yellow stripes, or sometimes simply black).  It is the neutral wire.\n	It is connected to the "centre tap" (CEC; "center tap" in the\n	NEC) of the distribution transformer supplying the power.  It\n	is connected to the grounding conductor in only one place (often\n	inside the panel).  The neutral and ground should not be connected\n	anywhere else.  Otherwise, weird and/or dangerous things may happen.\n\n	Furthermore, there should only be one grounding system in\n	a home.  Some codes require more than one grounding electrode.\n	These will be connected together, or connected to the neutral\n	at a common point - still one grounding system.  Adding additional\n	grounding electrodes connected to other portions of the house\n	wiring is unsafe and contrary to code.\n\n	If you add a subpanel, the ground and neutral are usually\n	brought as separate conductors from the main panel, and are\n	not connected together in the subpanel (ie: still only one\n	neutral-ground connection).  However, in some situations \n	(certain categories of separate buildings) you actually do\n	have to provide a second grounding electrode - consult your\n	inspector.\n\n	The other two wires will usually be black, and are the "hot"\n	wires.  They are attached to the distribution transformer as\n	well.\n\n	The two black wires are 180 degrees out of phase with each\n	other.  This means if you connect something to both hot wires,\n	the voltage will be 220 volts.  If you connect something to the\n	white and either of the two blacks you will get 110V.\n\n	Some panels seem to only have three wires coming into them.\n	This is either because the neutral and ground are connected\n	together at a different point (eg: the meter or pole) and one\n	wire is doing dual-duty as both neutral and ground, or in some\n	rare occasions, the service has only one hot wire (110V only\n	service).\n\nSubject: What is a circuit?\n\n	Inside the panel, connections are made to the incoming wires.\n	These connections are then used to supply power to selected\n	portions of the home.  There are three different combinations:\n		1) one hot, one neutral, and ground: 110V circuit.\n		2) two hots, no neutral, and ground: 220V circuit.\n		3) two hots, neutral, and ground: 220V circuit + neutral,\n		   and/or two 110V circuits with a common neutral.\n\n	(1) is used for most circuits supplying receptacles and\n	lighting within your house.  (3) is usually used for supplying\n	power to major appliances such as stoves, and dryers - they\n	often have need for both 220V and 110V, or for bringing several\n	circuits from the panel box to a distribution point.  (2) is\n	usually for special 220V motor circuits, electric heaters, or\n	air conditioners.\n\n	[Note: In the US, the NEC frequently permits a circuit similar\n	to (2) be used for stoves and dryers - namely, that there\n	are two hot wires, and a wire that does dual duty as neutral\n	and ground, and is connected to the frame as well as providing\n	the neutral for 110V purposes - three prong plugs instead\n	of four (*only* for stoves/dryers connected to the main panel.\n	When connected to most sub-panels, 4 prong plugs and receptacles\n	are required).  In our not-so-humble opinion this is crazy, but\n	the NFPA claims that this practice was re-evaluated for the 1992 NEC,\n	and found to be safe.  Check your local codes, or inquire as to\n	local practice -- there are restrictions on when this is\n	permissible.]\n\n	(1) is usually wired with three conductor wire: black for hot,\n	white for neutral, and bare for grounding.\n\n	(2) and (3) have one hot wire coloured red, the other black, a\n	bare wire for grounding, and in (3) a white wire for neutral.\n\n	You will sometimes see (2) wired with just a black, white and ground\n	wire.  Since the white is "hot" in this case, both the NEC and CEC\n	requires that the white wire be "permanently marked" at the ends\n	to indicate that it is a live wire.  Usually done with paint, nail\n	polish or sometimes electrical tape.\n\n	Each circuit is attached to the main wires coming into the\n	panel through a circuit breaker or fuse.\n\n	There are, in a few locales, circuits that look like (1), (2)\n	or (3) except that they have two bare ground wires.  Some places\n	require this for hot tubs and the like (one ground is "frame ground",\n	the other attaches to the motor).  This may or may not be an\n	alternative to GFCI protection.\n\nSubject: "grounding" versus "grounded" versus "neutral".\n\n	According to the terminology in the CEC and NEC, the\n	"grounding" conductor is for the safety ground, i.e., the green\n	or bare wire.  The word "neutral" is reserved for the white when\n	you have a circuit with more than one "hot" wire.  Since the white\n	wire is connected to neutral and the grounding conductor inside the\n	panel, the proper term is "grounded conductor".  However, the\n	potential confusion between "grounded conductor" and "grounding\n	conductor" can lead to potentially lethal mistakes - you should\n	never use the bare wire as a "grounded conductor" or white wire\n	as the "grounding conductor", even though they are connected\n	together in the panel.\n\n	[But not in subpanels - subpanels are fed neutral and ground\n	separately from the main panel.  Usually.]\n\n	In the trade, and in common usage, the word "neutral" is used\n	for "grounded conductor".  This FAQ uses "neutral" simply to\n	avoid potential confusion.  We recommend that you use "neutral"\n	too.  Thus the white wire is always (except in some light\n	switch applications) neutral.  Not ground.\n\nSubject: What does a fuse or breaker do?  What are the differences?\n\n	Fuses and circuit breakers are designed to interrupt the power\n	to a circuit when the current flow exceeds safe levels.  For\n	example, if your toaster shorts out, a fuse or breaker should\n	"trip", protecting the wiring in the walls from melting.  As\n	such, fuses and breakers are primarily intended to protect the\n	wiring -- UL or CSA approval supposedly indicates that the\n	equipment itself won't cause a fire.\n\n	Fuses contain a narrow strip of metal which is designed to melt\n	(safely) when the current exceeds the rated value, thereby\n	interrupting the power to the circuit.  Fuses trip relatively\n	fast.  Which can sometimes be a problem with motors which have\n	large startup current surges.  For motor circuits, you can use\n	a "time-delay" fuse (one brand is "fusetron") which will avoid\n	tripping on momentary overloads.  A fusetron looks like a\n	spring-loaded fuse.  A fuse can only trip once, then it must be\n	replaced.\n\n	Breakers are fairly complicated mechanical devices.  They\n	usually consist of one spring loaded contact which is latched\n	into position against another contact.  When the current flow\n	through the device exceeds the rated value, a bimetallic strip\n	heats up and bends.  By bending it "trips" the latch, and the\n	spring pulls the contacts apart.  Circuit breakers behave\n	similarly to fusetrons - that is, they tend to take longer to\n	trip at moderate overloads than ordinary fuses.  With high\n	overloads, they trip quickly.  Breakers can be reset a finite\n	number of times - each time they trip, or are thrown\n	when the circuit is in use, some arcing takes place, which\n	damages the contacts.  Thus, breakers should not be used in\n	place of switches unless they are specially listed for the\n	purpose.\n\n	Neither fuses nor breakers "limit" the current per se.  A dead\n	short on a circuit can cause hundreds or sometimes even\n	thousands of amperes to flow for a short period of time, which\n	can often cause severe damage.\n\nSubject: Breakers?  Can't I use fuses?\n\n	Statistics show that fuse panels have a significantly higher\n	risk of causing a fire than breaker panels.  This is usually\n	due to the fuse being loosely screwed in, or the contacts\n	corroding and heating up over time, or the wrong size fuse\n	being installed, or the proverbial "replace the fuse with a\n	penny" trick.\n\n	Since breakers are more permanently installed, and have better\n	connection mechanisms, the risk of fire is considerably less.\n\n	Fuses are prone to explode under extremely high overload.  When\n	a fuse explodes, the metallic vapor cloud becomes a conducting\n	path.  Result? from complete meltdown of the electrical panel,\n	melted service wiring, through fires in the electrical\n	distribution transformer and having your house burn down.\n	Breakers don't do this.\n\n	Many jurisdictions, particularly in Canada, no longer permit\n	fuse panels in new installations.  The NEC does permit new\n	fuse panels in some rare circumstances (requiring the special\n	inserts to "key" the fuseholder to specific size fuses)\n\n	Some devices, notably certain large air conditioners, require fuse\n	protection in addition to the breaker at the panel.  The fuse\n	is there to protect the motor windings from overload.  Check the\n	labeling on the unit.  This is usually only on large permanently\n	installed motors.  The installation instructions will tell you\n	if you need one.\n\nSubject: What size wire should I use?\n\n	For a 20 amp circuit, use 12 gauge wire.  For a 15 amp circuit,\n	you can use 14 gauge wire (in most locales).  For a long run,\n	though, you should use the next larger size wire, to avoid\n	voltage drops.  12 gauge is only slightly more expensive than\n	14 gauge, though it's stiffer and harder to work with.\n\n	Here's a quick table for normal situations.  Go up a size for\n	more than 100 foot runs, when the cable is in conduit, or\n	ganged with other wires in a place where they can't dissipate\n	heat easily:\n\n		Gauge		Amps\n		14		15\n		12		20\n		10		30\n		8		40\n		6		65\n	\n	We don't list bigger sizes because it starts getting very dependent\n	on the application and precise wire type.\n\nSubject: Where do these numbers come from?\n\n	There are two considerations, voltage drop and heat buildup.\n	The smaller the wire is, the higher the resistance is.  When\n	the resistance is higher, the wire heats up more, and there is\n	more voltage drop in the wiring.  The former is why you need\n	higher-temperature insulation and/or bigger wires for use in\n	conduit; the latter is why you should use larger wire for long\n	runs.\n\n	Neither effect is very significant over very short distances.\n	There are some very specific exceptions, where use of smaller\n	wire is allowed.  The obvious one is the line cord on most\n	lamps.  Don't try this unless you're certain that your use fits\n	one of those exceptions; you can never go wrong by using larger\n	wire.\n\nSubject: What does "14-2" mean?\n\n	This is used to describe the size and quantity of conductors\n	in a cable.  The first number specifies the gauge.  The second\n	the number of current carrying conductors in the wire - but\n	remember there's usually an extra ground wire.  "14-2" means\n	14 gauge, two insulated current carrying wires, plus bare ground.\n\n	-2 wire usually has a black, white and bare ground wire.  Sometimes\n	the white is red instead for 220V circuits without neutral.  In\n	the latter case, the sheath is usually red too.\n\n	-3 wire usually has a black, red, white and bare ground wire.\n	Usually carrying 220V with neutral.\n\nSubject: What is a "wirenut"/"marrette"/"marr connector"?  How are they\n	used?\n\n	A wire nut is a cone shaped threaded plastic thingummy that's used\n	to connect wires together.  "Marrette" or "Marr connector"\n	are trade names.  You'll usually use a lot of them in DIY wiring.\n\n	In essence, you strip the end of the wires about an inch, twist them\n	together, then twist the wirenut on.\n\n	Though some wirenuts advertise that you don't need to twist the\n	wire, do it anyways - it's more mechanically and electrically\n	secure.\n\n	There are many different sizes of wire nut.  You should check\n	that the wire nut you're using is the correct size for the\n	quantity and sizes of wire you're connecting together.\n\n	Don't just gimble the wires together with a pair of pliers or\n	your fingers.  Use a pair of blunt nose ("linesman") pliers,\n	and carefully twist the wires tightly and neatly.  Sometimes\n	it's a good idea to trim the resulting end to make sure it\n	goes in the wirenut properly.\n\n	Some people wrap the "open" end of the wirenut with electrical\n	tape.  This is probably not a good idea - the inspector may\n	tear it off during an inspection.  It's usually done because\n	a bit of bare wire is exposed outside the wire nut - instead\n	of taping it, the connection should be redone.\n\nSubject: What is a GFI/GFCI?\n\n	A GFCI is a ``ground-fault circuit interrupter''.  It measures\n	the current current flowing through the hot wire and the\n	neutral wire.  If they differ by more than a few milliamps, the\n	presumption is that current is leaking to ground via some other\n	path.  This may be because of a short circuit to the chassis of\n	an appliance, or to the ground lead, or through a person.  Any\n	of these situations is hazardous, so the GFCI trips, breaking\n	the circuit.\n\n	GFCIs do not protect against all kinds of electric shocks.  If,\n	for example, you simultaneously touched the hot and neutral\n	leads of a circuit, and no part of you was grounded, a GFCI\n	wouldn't help.  All of the current that passed from the hot\n	lead into you would return via the neutral lead, keeping the\n	GFCI happy.\n\n	The two pairs of connections on a GFCI outlet are not symmetric.\n	One is labeled LOAD; the other, LINE.  The incoming power feed\n	*must* be connected to the LINE side, or the outlet will not be\n	protected.  The LOAD side can be used to protect all devices\n	downstream from it.  Thus, a whole string of outlets can be\n	covered by a single GFCI outlet.\n\nSubject: Where should GFCIs be used?\n\n	The NEC mandates GFCIs for 110V, 15A or 20A single phase\n	outlets, in bathrooms, kitchens within 6' of the sink, garages,\n	unfinished basements or crawl spaces, outdoors, near a pool, or\n	just about anywhere else where you're likely to encounter water\n	or dampness.  There are exceptions for inaccessible outlets,\n	those dedicated to appliances ``occupying fixed space'',\n	typically refrigerators and freezers, and for sump pumps and\n	laundry appliances.\n\n	The CEC does not mandate as many GFCIs.  In particular, there\n	is no requirement to protect kitchen outlets, or most garage or\n	basement outlets.  Basement outlets must be protected if you\n	have a dirt floor, garage outlets if they're near the door to\n	outside.  Bathrooms and most exterior outlets must have GFCIs.\n\n	Even if you are not required to have GFCI protection, you may\n	want to consider installing it anyway.  Unless you need a GFCI\n	breaker (see below), the cost is low.  In the U.S., GFCI\n	outlets can cost as little as US$8.  (Costs are a bit higher in\n	Canada:  C$12.)  Evaluate your own risk factors.  Does your\n	finished basement ever get wet?  Do you have small children?\n	Do you use your garage outlets to power outdoor tools?  Does\n	water or melted snow ever puddle inside your garage?\n\nSubject: Where shouldn't I use a GFCI?\n\n	GFCIs are generally not used on circuits that (a) don't pose a\n	safety risk, and (b) are used to power equipment that must run\n	unattended for long periods of time.  Refrigerators, freezers,\n	and sump pumps are good examples.  The rationale is that GFCIs\n	are sometimes prone to nuisance trips.  Some people claim that\n	the inductive delay in motor windings can cause a momentary\n	current imbalance, tripping the GFCI.  Note, though, that most\n	GFCI trips are real; if you're getting a lot of trips for no\n	apparent reason, you'd be well-advised to check your wiring\n	before deciding that the GFCI is broken or useless.\n\nSubject: What is the difference between a GFCI outlet and a GFCI breaker?\n\n	For most situations, you can use either a GFCI outlet as the\n	first device on the circuit, or you can install a breaker with\n	a built-in GFCI.  The former is generally preferred, since GFCI\n	breakers are quite expensive.  For example, an ordinary GE\n	breaker costs ~US$5; the GFCI model costs ~US$35.  There is one\n	major exception:  if you need to protect a ``multi-wire branch\n	circuit'' (two or more circuits sharing a common neutral wire),\n	such as a Canadian-style kitchen circuit, you'll need a\n	multi-pole GFCI breaker.  Unfortunately, these are expensive;\n	the cost can range into the hundreds of dollars, depending on\n	what brand of panel box you have.  But if you must protect such\n	a circuit (say, for a pool heater), you have no choice.\n\n	One more caveat -- GFCI outlets are bulky.  You may want to use\n	an oversize box when installing them.  On second thought, use\n	large (actually deep) boxes everywhere.  You'll thank yourself for it.\n\n	Incidentally, if you're installing a GFCI to ensure that one\n	specific outlet is protected (such as a bathroom), you don't\n	really have to go to all of the trouble to find the first\n	outlet in the circuit, you could simply find the first outlet\n	in the bathroom, and not GFCI anything upstream of it.  But\n	protecting the whole circuit is preferred.\n\n	When you install a GFCI, it's a good idea to use the little\n	"ground fault protected" stickers that come with it and mark\n	the outlets downstream of the GFCI.  You can figure out which\n	outlets are "downstream", simply by tripping the GFCI with the\n	test button and see which outlets are dead.\n\nSubject: What's the purpose of the ground prong on an outlet, then?\n\n	Apart from their use in electronics, which we won't comment on,\n	and for certain fluorescent lights (they won't turn on without\n	a good ground connection), they're intended to guard against\n	insulation failures within the device.  Generally, the case of\n	the appliance is connected to the ground lead.  If there's an\n	insulation failure that shorts the hot lead to the case, the\n	ground lead conducts the electricity away safely (and possibly\n	trips the circuit breaker in the process).  If the case is not\n	grounded and such a short occurs, the case is live -- and if\n	you touch it while you're grounded, you'll get zapped.  Of\n	course, if the circuit is GFCI-protected, it will be a very\n	tiny zap -- which is why you can use GFCIs to replace\n	ungrounded outlets (both NEC and CEC).\n\n	There are some appliances that should *never* be grounded.  In\n	particular, that applies to toasters and anything else with\n	exposed conductors.  Consider:  if you touch the heating\n	electrode in a toaster, and you're not grounded, nothing will\n	happen.  If you're slightly grounded, you'll get a small shock;\n	the resistance will be too high.  But if the case were\n	grounded, and you were holding it, you'd be the perfect path to\n	ground...\n\nSubject: Why is one prong wider than the other?  Polarization\n\n	Nowadays, many two-prong devices have one prong wider than the\n	other.  This is so that the device could rely (not guaranteed!)\n	on one specific wire being neutral, and the other hot.\n	This is particularly advantageous in light fixtures, where the\n	the shell should neutral (safety), or other devices which want to\n	have an approximate ground reference (ie: some radios).\n\n	Most 2-prong extension cords have wide prongs too.\n\n	This requires that you wire your outlets and plugs the right\n	way around.  You want the wide prong to be neutral, and the\n	narrow one hot.  Most outlets have a darker metal for the\n	hot screw, and lighter coloured screw for the neutral.\n	If not, you can usually figure out which is which by which\n	prong the terminating screw connects to.\n\nSubject: What kind of outlets do I need in a kitchen?\n\n	The NEC requires at least two 20 amp ``small appliance\n	circuits'' for kitchens.  The CEC requires split-duplex\n	receptacles.  Outlets must be installed such that no point is more\n	than 24" (NEC) (900 mm CEC) from an outlet.  Every counter wider\n	than 12" (NEC) or 300 mm (CEC) must have at least one outlet.\n	The circuit these outlets are on may not feed any outlets except\n	in the kitchen, pantry, or dining room.  Furthermore, these circuits\n	are in addition to any required for refrigerators, stoves, microwaves,\n	lighting, etc.  Non-dedicated outlets within 6' of a sink *must* be\n	protected by a GFCI (NEC only).\n\n	Split duplex receptacles are fed with a 220V circuit.  The tab\n	is broken on the hot side of the outlet, and one hot goes to\n	the upper outlet, and the other hot goes to the lower outlet.\n	The neutral connects to both outlets through one screw.  When\n	"carrying through" to another outlet, the neutral must be\n	pigtailed, such that removing the outlet, or having the neutral\n	connection fall off doesn't cause the neutral to disconnect\n	from downstream outlets.\n\nSubject: Where must outlets and switches be in bathrooms?\n\n	There must be at least one outlet in each bathroom, adjacent to\n	the sink, in addition to any outlet that may be incorporated in\n	the light fixture.  All such outlets *must* be GFCI-protected.\n\nSubject: What is Romex/NM/NMD?  What is BX?  When should I use each?\n\n	Romex is a brand name for a type of plastic insulated wire.\n	Sometimes called non-metallic sheath.  The formal name is NM.\n	This is suitable for use in dry, protected areas (ie: inside\n	stud walls, on the sides of joists etc.), that are not subject\n	to mechanical damage or excessive heat.  Most newer homes are\n	wired almost exclusively with NM wire.  There are several\n	different categories of NM cable.\n\n	BX cable -- technically known as armored cable or "AC" has a\n	flexible aluminum or steel sheath over the conductors and is\n	fairly resistant to damage.\n\n	TECK cable is AC with an additional external thermoplastic\n	sheath.\n	\n	Protection for cable in concealed locations: where NM or AC cable\n	is run through studs, joists or similar wooden members, the outer\n	surface of the cable must be kept at least 32mm/1.25" (CEC & NEC)\n	from the edges of the wooden members, or the cable should be protected\n	from mechanical injury.  This latter protection can take the form of\n	metal plates (such as spare outlet box ends) or conduit.\n\n	[Note: inspector-permitted practise in Canada suggests that armored\n	cable, or flexible conduit can be used as the mechanical protection,\n	but this is technically illegal.]\n\n	Additional protection recommendations (these are rules in the\n	Canadian codes - they are reasonable answers to the vague\n	references to "exposed to mechanical damage" in both the NEC\n	and CEC):\n\n	    - NM cable should be protected against mechanical damage\n	      where it passes through floors or on the surface of walls\n	      in exposed locations under 5 feet from the floor.\n	      Ie: use AC instead, flexible conduit, wooden guards etc.\n	    - Where cable is suspended, as in, connections to furnaces\n	      or water heaters, the wire should be protected.  Canadian\n	      practise is usually to install a junction or outlet\n	      box on the wall, and use a short length of AC cable\n	      or NM cable in flexible conduit to "jump" to the appliance.\n	      Stapling NM to a piece of lumber is also sometimes used.\n	    - Where NM cable is run in close proximity to heating\n	      ducts or pipe, heat transfer should be minimized by\n	      means of a 25mm/1" air space, or suitable insulation\n	      material (a wad of fiberglass).\n	    - NM cable shall be supported within 300mm/1' of every box\n	      or fitting, and at intervals of no more than 1.5m/5'.\n	      Holes in joists or studs are considered "supports".\n	      Some slack in the cable should be provided adjacent to\n	      each box.  [while fishing cable is technically in violation,\n	      it is permitted where "proper" support is impractical]\n	    - 2 conductor NM cable should never be stapled on edge.\n	      [Knight also insists on only one cable per staple, referring\n	      to the "workmanship" clause, but this seems more honoured\n	      in the breach...]\n	    - cable should never be buried in plaster, cement or\n	      similar finish.\n	    - cable should be protected where it runs behind baseboards.\n	    - Cable may not be run on the upper edge of ceiling joists\n	      or the lower edges of rafters where the headroom is more\n	      than 1m (39").\n\n	Whenever BX cable is terminated at a box with a clamp, small\n	plastic bushings must be inserted in the end of the cable to\n	prevent the clamps forcing the sharp ends of the armor through\n	the insulation.\n\n	BX is sometimes a good idea in a work shop unless covered by\n	solid wall coverings.\n\n	In places where damage is more likely (like on the back wall of\n	a garage ;-), you may be required to use conduit, a\n	UL- (or CSA-) approved metal pipe.  You use various types of\n	fittings to join the pipe or provide entrance/exit for the\n	wire.\n\n	Service entrances frequently use a plastic conduit.\n\n	In damp places (eg: buried wiring to outdoor lighting) you will\n	need special wire (eg: CEC NMW90, NEC UF).  NMW90 looks like\n	very heavy-duty NMD90.  You will usually need short lengths of\n	conduit where the wire enters/exits the ground.  [See underground\n	wiring section.]\n\n 	Thermoplastic sheath wire (such as NM, NMW etc.) should not be\n 	exposed to direct sunlight unless explicitly approved for that\n 	purpose.\n\n	Many electrical codes do not permit the routing of wire through\n	furnace ducts, including cold air return plenums constructed\n	by metal sheeting enclosing joist spaces.   The reason for this\n	is that if there's a fire, the ducting will spread toxic gasses\n	from burning insulation very rapidly through the building.\n	Teflon insulated wire is permitted in plenums in many areas.\n	\n 	Canada appears to use similar wire designations to the US,\n 	except that Canadian wire designations usually include the\n 	temperature rating in Celsius.  Eg: "AC90" versus "AC".\n	In the US, NM-B is 90 degrees celcius.\n\n	NOTE: local codes vary.  This is one of the items that changes\n	most often.  Eg: Chicago codes require conduit *everywhere*.\n	There are very different requirements for mobile homes.\n	Check your local codes, *especially* if you're doing anything\n	that's the slightest out of the ordinary.\n\n	Wire selection table (incomplete - the real tables are enormous,\n	uncommon wire types or applications omitted)\n\n	Condition			Type	CEC	NEC\n\n	Exposed/Concealed dry		plastic	NMD90	NM\n					armor	AC90	AC\n						TECK90\n\n	Exposed/Concealed damp		plastic	NMD90	NMC\n					armor	ACWU90\n						TECK90\n\n	Exposed/Concealed wet		plastic	NMWU90\n					armor	ACWU90\n						TECK90\n	\n	Exposed to weather		plastic	NMWU\n						TW etc.\n					armor	TECK90\n	\n	Direct earth burial/		plastic	NMWU*	UF\n	Service entrance			RWU\n						TWU\n					armor	RA90\n						TECK90\n						ACWU90\n	[* NMWU not for service entrance]\n\nSubject: Should I use plastic or metal boxes?\n\n	The NEC permits use of plastic boxes with non-metallic cable\n	only.  The reasoning is simple -- with armored cable, the box\n	itself provides ground conductor continuity.  U.S. plastic\n	boxes don't use metal cable clamps.\n\n	The CEC is slightly different.  The CEC never permits cable\n	armor as a grounding conductor.  However, you must still\n	provide ground continuity for metallic sheath.  The CEC also\n	requires grounding of any metal cable clamps on plastic boxes.\n\n	The advantage of plastic boxes is comparatively minor even for\n	non-metallic sheathed cable -- you can avoid making one ground\n	connection and they sometimes cost a little less.  On the other\n	hand, plastic boxes are more vulnerable to impacts.  For\n	exposed or shop wiring, metal boxes are probably better.\n\nSubject: Junction box positioning?\n\n	A junction box is a box used only for connecting wires together.\n\n	Junction boxes must be located in such a way that they're accessible\n	later.  Ie: not buried under plaster.  Excessive use of junction\n	boxes is often a sign of sloppy installation, and inspectors may\n	get nasty.\n\nSubject: Can I install a replacement light fixture?\n\n	In general, one can replace fixtures freely, subject to a few\n	caveats.  First, of course, one should check the amperage\n	rating of the circuit.  If your heart is set on installing half\n	a dozen 500 watt floodlights, you may need to run a new wire\n	back to the panel box.  But there are some more subtle\n	constraints as well.  For example, older house\n	wiring doesn't have high-temperature insulation.  The excess\n	heat generated by a ceiling-mounted lamp can and will cause the\n	insulation to deteriorate and crack, with obvious bad results.\n	Some newer fixtures are specifically marked for high\n	temperature wire only.  (You may find, in fact, that your\n	ceiling wiring already has this problem, in which case\n	replacing any devices is a real adventure.)\n\n	Other concerns include providing a suitable ground for some\n	fluorescent fixtures, and making sure that the ceiling box and\n	its mounting are strong enough to support the weight of a heavy\n	chandelier or ceiling fan.  You may need to install a new box\n	specifically listed for this purpose.  A 2x4 across the ceiling\n	joists makes a good support.  Metal brackets are also available\n	that can be fished into ceilings thru the junction box hole and\n	mounted between the joists.\n\n	There are special rules for recessed light fixtures such as\n	"pot" lamps or heat lamps.  When these are installed in insulated\n	ceilings, they can present a very substantial fire hazard.\n	The CEC provides for the installation of pot lamps in insulated\n	ceilings, provided that the fixture is boxed in a "coffin" (usually\n	8'x16"x12" - made by making a pair of joists 12" high, and covering\n	with plywood) that doesn't have any insulation.  (Yes, that's 8 *feet*\n	long)\n\n	NEC rules are somewhat less stringent.  They require at least 3"\n	clearance between the fixture and any sort of thermal insulation.\n	The rules also say that one should not obstruct free air movement,\n	which means that a CEC-style ``coffin'' might be worthwhile.\n	Presumably, that's up to the local inspector.  [The CEC doesn't\n	actually mandate the coffin per-se, this seems to be an inspector\n	requirement to make absolutely certain that the fixture can't get\n	accidentally buried in insulation.  Ie: if you have insulation blown\n	in later.]\n\n	There are now fixtures that contain integral thermal cutouts and\n	fairly large cases that can be buried directly in insulation.  They are\n	usually limited to 75 watt bulbs, and are unfortunately, somewhat\n	more expensive than the older types.  Before you use them, you should\n	ensure that they have explicit UL or CSA approval for such uses.\n	Follow the installation instructions carefully; the prescribed location\n	for the sensor can vary.\n\n	There does not yet appear to be a heat lamp fixture that is approved\n	for use in insulation.  The "coffin" appears the only legal approach.\n\nSubject: What does it mean when the lights brighten when a motor starts?\n\n	This usually means that the neutral wire in the panel is\n	loose.  Depending on the load balance, one hot wire may end up\n	being more than 110V, and the other less than 110V, with\n	respect to ground.  This is a very hazardous situation - it can\n	destroy your electronic equipment, possibly start fires, and in\n	some situations electrocute you (ie: some US jurisdictions\n	require the stove frame connected to neutral).\n\n	If this happens, contact your electrical authority immediately\n	and have them come and check out the problem.\n\n	Note: a brief (< 1 second) brightening is sometimes normal with\n	lighting and motors on the same 220V with neutral circuit.  A\n	loose main panel neutral will usually show increased brightness\n	far longer than one second.  In case of doubt, get help.\n\nSubject: What is 3 phase power?  Should I use it?  Can I get it in my house?\n\n	Three phase power has three "hot" wires, 120 degrees out of\n	phase with each other.  These are usually used for large motors\n	because it is more "efficient", provides a bit more starting torque,\n	and because the motors are simpler and hence cheaper.\n\n	You're most likely to encounter a 3 phase circuit that shows\n	110 volts between any hot and ground, and 208 volts between\n	any two hots.  The latter shows the difference between a normal\n	220V/110V common neutral circuit, which is 240 volts between the\n	two hots.  There are 3 phase circuits with different voltages.\n\n	Bringing in a 3 phase feed to your house is usually\n	ridiculously expensive, or impossible.  If the equipment you\n	want to run has a standard motor mount, it is *MUCH* cheaper to\n	buy a new 110V or 220V motor for it.  In some cases it is\n	possible to run 3 phase equipment on ordinary power if you have\n	a "capacitor start" unit, or use a larger motor as a\n	(auto-)generator.  These are tricky, but are a good solution if\n	the motor is non-standard size, or too expensive or too big to\n	replace.  The Taunton Press book ``The Small Shop'' has an\n	article on how to do this if you must.\n\n	Note that you lose any possible electrical efficiency by using\n	such a converter.  The laws of thermodynamics guarantee that.\n\nSubject: Is it better to run motors at 110 or 220?\n\n	Theoretically, it doesn't make any difference.  However, there\n	is a difference is the amount of power lost in the supply\n	wiring.  All things being equal, a 220V motor will lose 4 times\n	less power in the house wiring than a 110V motor.  This also\n	means that the startup surge loss will be less, and the motor\n	will get to speed quicker.  And in some circumstances, the\n	smaller power loss will lead to longer motor life.\n\n	This is usually irrelevant unless the supply wires are more\n	than 50 feet long.\n\nSubject: What is this nonsense about 3HP on 110V 15A circuits?\n\n	It is a universal physical law that 1 HP is equal to 746\n	watts.  Given heating loss, power factor and other inefficiencies,\n	it is usually best to consider 1 HP is going to need 1000-1200\n	watts.  A 110V 15A circuit can only deliver 1850 watts to a motor,\n	so it cannot possibly be more than approximately 2 HP.  Given rational\n	efficiency factors, 1.5HP is more like it.\n\n	Some equipment manufacturers (Sears in particular, most router\n	manufacturers in general ;-) advertise a HP rating that is far\n	in excess of what is possible.  They are giving you a "stall\n	horsepower" or similar.  That means the power is measured when\n	the motor is just about to stop turning because of the load.\n	What they don't mention is that if you kept it in that\n	condition for more than a few seconds hopefully your breaker\n	will trip, otherwise the motor will melt -- it's drawing far\n	more current than it can continuously.\n\n	When comparing motors, compare the continuous horsepower.  This\n	should be on the motor nameplate.  If you can't find that figure,\n	check the amperage rating, which is always present.\n\nSubject: How do I convert two prong receptacles to three prong?\n\n	Older homes frequently have two-prong receptacles instead\n	of the more modern three.  These receptacles have no safety\n	ground, and the cabling usually has no ground wire.  Neither\n	the NEC or CEC permits installing new 2 prong receptacles anymore.\n\n	There are several different approaches to solving this:\n	    1) If the wiring is done through conduit or BX, and the\n	       conduit is continuous back to the panel, you can connect\n	       the third prong of a new receptacle to the receptacle\n	       box.  NEC mainly - CEC frowns on this practise.\n	    2) If there is a copper cold water pipe going nearby, and\n	       it's continuous to the main house ground point, you can\n	       run a conductor to it from the third prong.\n	    3) Run a ground conductor back to the main panel.\n	    4) Easiest: install a GFCI receptacle.  The ground lug\n	       should not be connected to anything, but the GFCI\n	       protection itself will serve instead.  The GFCI\n	       will also protect downstream (possibly also two prong\n	       outlets).  If you do this to protect downstream outlets,\n	       the grounds must not be connected together.  Since it\n	       wouldn't be connected to a real ground, a wiring fault\n	       could energize the cases of 3 prong devices connected\n	       to other outlets.  Be sure, though, that there aren't\n	       indirect ground plug connections, such as via the sheath\n	       on BX cable.\n\n	The CEC permits you to replace a two prong receptacle with a three\n	prong if you fill the U ground with a non-conducting goop.\n	Like caulking compound.  This is not permitted in the NEC.\n\nSubject: Are you sure about GFCIs and ungrounded outlets?\n	Should the test button work?\n\n	We're sure about what the NEC and CEC say.  Remember, though,\n	that your local codes may vary.  As for the TEST button -- there's\n	a resistor connecting the LOAD side of the hot wire to the LINE\n	side of the neutral wire when you press the TEST button.  Current\n	through this resistor shows up as an imbalance, and trips the GFCI.\n	This is a simple, passive, and reliable test, and doesn't require\n	a real ground to work.  If your GFCI does not trip when you press\n	the TEST button, it is very probably defective or miswired.  Again:\n	if the test button doesn't work, something's broken, and potentially\n	dangerous.  The problem should be corrected immediately.\n\n	The instructions that come with some GFCIs specify that the ground\n	wire must be connected.  We do not know why they say this.  The\n	causes may be as mundane as an old instruction sheet, or with the\n	formalities of UL or CSA listing -- perhaps the device was never\n	tested without the ground wire being connected.  On the other hand,\n	UL or CSA approval should only have been granted if the device\n	behaves properly in *all* listed applications, including ungrounded\n	outlet replacement.  (One of us called Leviton; their GFCIs are\n	labeled for installation on grounded circuits only.  The technician\n	was surprised to see that; he agreed that the NEC does not require\n	it, and promised to investigate.)\n\nSubject: How should I wire my shop?\n\n	As with any other kind of wiring, you need enough power for all\n	devices that will be on simultaneously.  The code specifies\n	that you should stay under 80% of the nominal capacity of the\n	circuit.  For typical home shop use, this means one circuit for\n	the major power tools, and possibly one for a dust collector or\n	shop vac.  Use at least 12 gauge wire -- many power tools have\n	big motors, with a big start-up surge.  If you can, use 20 amp\n	breakers (NEC), though CEC requires standard 20A receptacles\n	which means you'd have to "replug" all your equipment.  Lights\n	should either be on a circuit of their own -- and not shared\n	with circuits in the rest of the house -- or be on at least two\n	separate circuits.  The idea is that you want to avoid a\n	situation where a blade is still spinning at several thousand\n	RPM, while you're groping in the dark for the OFF switch.\n\n	Do install lots of outlets.  It's easier to install them in the\n	beginning, when you don't have to cut into an existing cable.\n	It's useful if at least two circuits are accessible at each\n	point, so you can run a shop vac or a compressor at the same\n	time as the tool you really want.  But use metal boxes and\n	plates, and maybe even metal-sheathed cable; you may have\n	objects flying around at high speeds if something goes a bit\n	wrong.\n\n	Note that some jurisdictions have a "no horizontal wiring"\n	rule in workshops or other unfinished areas that are used\n	for working.  What this means is that all wiring must be\n	run along structural members.  Ie: stapled to studs.\n\n	Other possible shop circuits include heater circuits, 220V\n	circuits for some large tools, and air compressor circuits.\n	Don't overload circuits, and don't use extension cords if you\n	can help it, unless they're rated for high currents.  (A coiled\n	extension cord is not as safe as a straight length of wire of\n	the same gauge.  Also, the insulation won't withstand as much\n	heat, and heat dissipation is the critical issue.)\n\n	If your shop is located at some remove from your main panel,\n	you should probably install a subpanel, and derive your shop\n	wiring from it.  If you have young children, you may want to\n	equip this panel with a cut-off switch, and possibly a lock.\n	If you want to install individual switches to ``safe''\n	particular circuits, make sure you get ones rated high enough.\n	For example, ordinary light switches are not safely able to\n	handle the start-up surge generated by a table saw.  Buy\n	``horsepower-rated'' switches instead.\n\n	Finally, note that most home shops are in garages or unfinished\n	basements; hence the NEC requirements for GFCIs apply.  And\n	even if you ``know'' that you'd never use one of your shop\n	outlets to run a lawn mower, the next owner of your house might\n	have a different idea.\n\n	Note: Fine Woodworking magazine often carries articles on shop\n	wiring.  April 1992 is one place to start.\n\nSubject: Underground Wiring\n\n	You will need to prepare a trench to specifications, use\n	special wire, protect the wire with conduit or special plastic\n	tubing and possibly lumber (don't use creosoted lumber, it rots\n	thermoplastic insulation and acts as a catalyst in the corrosion\n	of lead).  The transition from in-house to underground wire is\n	generally via conduit.  All outdoor boxes must be specifically\n	listed for the purpose, and contain the appropriate gaskets,\n	fittings, etc.  If the location of the box is subject to immersion\n	in water, a more serious style of water-proof box is needed.  And\n	of course, don't forget the GFCIs.\n\n	The required depths and other details vary from jurisdiction to\n	jurisdiction, so we suggest you consult your inspector about\n	your specific situation.\n\n	A hint: buy a roll of bright yellow tape that says "buried power\n	line" and bury it a few inches above where the wire has been placed.\n\nSubject: Aluminum wiring\n\n	During the 1970's, aluminum (instead of copper) wiring became\n	quite popular and was extensively used.  Since that time,\n	aluminum wiring has been implicated in a number of house fires,\n	and most jurisdictions no longer permit it in new installations.\n	We recommend, even if you're allowed to, that do not use it for new\n	wiring.\n\n	But don't panic if your house has aluminum wiring.  Aluminum\n	wiring, when properly installed, can be just as safe as copper.\n	Aluminum wiring is, however, very unforgiving of improper\n	installation.  We will cover a bit of the theory behind potential\n	problems, and what you can do to make your wiring safe.\n\n	The main problem with aluminum wiring is a phenomenon known as\n	"cold creep".  When aluminum wiring warms up, it expands.  When\n	it cools down, it contracts.  Unlike copper, when aluminum goes\n	through a number of warm/cool cycles it loses a bit of tightness each\n	time.  To make the problem worse, aluminum oxidises, or corrodes\n	when in contact with certain types of metal, so the resistance\n	of the connection goes up.  Which causes it to heat up and corrode/\n	oxidize still more.  Eventually the wire may start getting very hot,\n	melt the insulation or fixture it's attached to, and possibly even\n	cause a fire.\n\n	Since people usually encounter aluminum wiring when they move\n	into a house built during the 70's, we will cover basic points of\n	safe aluminum wiring.  We suggest that, if you're considering purchasing\n	a home with aluminum wiring, or have discovered it later, that you\n	hire a licensed electrician or inspector to check over the wiring\n	for the following things:\n\n	    1) Fixtures (eg: outlets and switches) directly attached to\n	       aluminum wiring should be rated for it.  The device will\n	       be stamped with "Al/Cu" or "CO/ALR".  The latter supersedes\n	       the former, but both are safe.   These fixtures are somewhat\n	       more expensive than the ordinary ones.\n\n	    2) Wires should be properly connected (at least 3/4 way around\n	       the screw in a clockwise direction).  Connections should be\n	       tight.  While repeated tightening of the screws can make the\n	       problem worse, during the inspection it would pay off to snug\n	       up each connection.\n\n	       Note that aluminum wiring is still often used for the\n	       main service entrance cable.  It should be inspected.\n\n	    3) "push-in" terminals are an extreme hazard with aluminum wire.\n	       Any connections using push-in terminals should be redone with\n	       the proper screw connections immediately.\n\n	    4) There should be no signs of overheating: darkened connections,\n	       melted insulation, or "baked" fixtures.  Any such damage should\n	       be repaired.\n	    \n	    5) Connections between aluminum and copper wire need to be\n	       handled specially.  Current Canadian codes require that the\n	       wire nut used must be specially marked for connecting\n	       aluminum to copper.  The NEC requires that the wire be\n	       connected together using special crimp devices, with an\n	       anti-oxidant grease.  The tools and materials for the latter\n	       are quite expensive - not practical to do it yourself unless\n	       you can rent the tool.\n\n	    6) Any non-rated receptacle can be connected to aluminum wiring\n	       by means of a short copper "pigtail".  See (5) above.\n	    \n	    7) Shows reasonable workmanship: neat wiring, properly stripped\n	       (not nicked) wire etc.\n    \n	If, when considering purchasing a home, an inspection of the wiring\n	shows no problems or only one or two, we believe that you can consider\n	the wiring safe.  If there are signs of problems in many places,\n	we suggest you look elsewhere.  If the wrong receptacles are used,\n	you can replace them with the proper type, or use pigtails - having\n	this professionally done can range from $3 to $10 per receptacle/switch.\n	You can do this yourself too.\n\nSubject: I'm buying a house!  What should I do?\n\n	Congratulations.  But...  It's generally a good idea to hire\n	an inspector to look through the house for hidden gotchas.\n	Not just for wiring, but plumbing and structural as well.  If an\n	inspection of the wiring shows no problems or only one or two minor\n	ones, we believe that you can consider the wiring safe (after any\n	minor problems are fixed).  If there are signs of problems in many\n	places, we suggest you look elsewhere.\n\n	Here's some hints on what to look for:\n\n	Obvious non-code wiring can include:\n\n		- Zip cord wiring, either concealed or nailed to walls\n		- Hot wiring on the identified (neutral) conductor without\n		  proper marking.\n		- Ungrounded grounding outlets (except when downstream of\n		  a GFCI)\n		- Splices hanging in mid-air (other than proper knob-and-tube)\n		- Switched neutrals\n		- Unsecured Romex swinging about like grapevines\n\n	Certain wiring practises that are actually to code (or were at one\n	time) sometimes reveal DIY wiring that may have hidden violations:\n\n		- Switches that seem to control nothing (abandoned, perhaps\n		   not properly terminated wiring)\n		- A wall switch that shuts off a group of lights that are\n		  separately controlled by other wall switches.  (except when\n		  it's *really* convenient ;-)\n		- Switches and outlets in bizarre locations\n		- Great numbers of junction boxes without outlets or lamps\n		- Junction boxes with great numbers of wires going into them\n		- Wiring that passes through a closet instead of a wall or\n		  ceiling\n		- Backwrapped grounding wires\n\nSubject: What is this weird stuff?  Old style wiring\n	\n	In the years since Edison "invented" electricity, several different\n	wiring "styles" have come and gone.  When you buy an older home you\n	may encounter some of this stuff.  This section describes the old \n	methods, and some of their idiosyncrasies.\n\n	The oldest wiring system you're likely to encounter is called\n	"knob and tube" (K&T).  It is made up of individual conductors with\n	a cloth insulation.  The wires are run along side structural\n	members (eg: joists or studs) using ceramic stand-offs (knobs).\n	Wire is run through structural members using ceramic tubes.  Connections\n	were made by twisting the wire together, soldering, and wrapping\n	with tape.  Since the hot and neutral were run separately,\n	the wiring tends to be rather confusing.  A neutral often runs\n	down the centre of each room, with "taps" off to each fixture.\n	The hot wire tended to run from one fixture to the next.  In some\n	cases K&T isn't colour-coded, so the neutral is often the same\n	colour as the hot wires.\n\n	You'll see K&T in homes built as late as the 40's.\n\n	Comments on K&T:\n\n		- the people installing K&T were pretty paranoid about\n		  electricity, so the workmanship tends to be pretty good.\n		- The wire, insulation and insulators tend to stand up\n		  very well.  Most K&T I've seen, for example, is in\n		  quite good condition.\n		- No grounding.  Grounding is usually difficult to install.\n		- boxes are small.  Receptacle replacement (particularly with\n		  GFCI) can be difficult.  No bushing on boxes either,\n		  so wiring changes need special attention to box entry.\n		- Sometimes the neutral isn't balanced very well between\n		  separately hot circuits, so it is sometimes possible to\n		  overload the neutral without exceeding the fusing on\n		  any circuit.\n		- Building code does not permit insulation in walls\n		  that contain K&T.\n		- Connection to existing K&T from new circuits can be\n		  tricky.  Consult your inspector.\n		- Modern wiring practise requires considerably more\n		  outlets to be installed than K&T systems did.\n	\n	Since K&T tends to be in pretty decent condition it generally isn't\n	necessary to replace it simply because it's K&T.  What you should\n	watch out for is renovations that have interfered with it and\n	be cautious about circuit loading.  In many cases it's perfectly\n	reasonable to leave existing K&T alone, and add new fixtures on\n	new circuits using modern techniques.\n	\n	After K&T, they invented multi-conductor cable.  The first type\n	you will see is roughly a cloth and varnish insulation.  It looks\n	much like the romex cable of the last decade or two.  This stuff was\n	used in the 40's and 50's.  Again, no grounding conductor.\n	It was installed much like modern wiring.  Its major drawback\n	is that this type of insulation embrittles.  We've seen whole\n	systems where the insulation would fracture and fall off at\n	a touch.  BX cable of the same vintage has similar problems.\n\n	This stuff is very fragile, and becomes rather hazardous if\n	the wires become bare.  This wiring should be left untouched as\n	much as possible - whenever an opportunity arises, replace it.\n	A simple receptacle or switch replacement can turn into a several\n	hour long frustrating fight with electrical tape or heat-shrink\n	tubing.\n\n	After this wiring technique, the more modern romex was invented.\n	It's almost a asphalt impregnated cloth.  Often a bit sticky.\n	This stuff stands up reasonably well and doesn't present a hazard\n	and is reasonably easy to work with.  It does not need to be\n	replaced - it should be considered as safe as the "modern" stuff -\n	thermoplastic insulation wire.  Just don't abuse it too much.\n\nSubject: Where do I buy stuff?\n\n	Try to find a proper electrical supply outlet near you.  Their\n	prices will often be considerably better than chain hardware stores or\n	DIY centres, have better quality materials, have wider variety\n	including the "odd" stuff, and have people behind the counter that\n	know what you're talking about.  Cultivate friendly knowledgeable\n	sales people.  They'll give you much valuable information.

Yes, I know it sounds crazy. Call it an urge. Call it what you want.\nJust don't ask why :-)\n\nAnyway, I'd like to build a UV flashlight, cheaply.

---\n\nI was wondering, what copy protection techniques are avaliable, and how\neffective are they?  Has anyone have any experience in this area?\n\n                      With highest regards,\n                           Babak   Sehari.
That depends entirely upon the advertiser whose number you circled.\nRadio Electronics compiles all of the cards, then each advertiser\ngets a computer printout of the names and addresses of all of the readers\nwho circled their number. Some magazines also provide the data on\nself-adhesive labels, and the really big magazines provide the\ndata on computer disk.\n\nThe advertiser decides what to do with the data they get. You will\nnotice that the Radio Electronics information card (commonly called\na "bingo card" in the industry) includes lines for a company name\nand a business phone number. My guess would be that the big, national\nadvertisers make a distinction between hobbiests and professionals as\nbest they can. For example, if you include Motorola as your company\nand include a business phone (and a mail stop), Tektronics will probably\nsend you a copy of their hard-bound catalog and have a sales engineer\ncall you about a week later. If you leave it blank, odds are they\nwill send you a slick brochure and direct you to a local retail\noutlet. Medium and small companies are more likely to send you th\ne whole catalog. And then some companies, like Digikey or Jameco, have\nnothing to mail out accept the catalog.\n\nA couple of other interesting points about bingo cards: Free, industry\nmagazines like EDN and such also log your card to their computer. They\nuse the information at least three ways. They note that you really do read\nthe magazine and are more likely to continue your subscription or push\nyou, through repeated mailings, to re-subscribe. They also compile\nhow many people requested which data for their marketing demographics.\nThis way thay can tell a prospective advertiser that "23% of readers\nrequesting data were interested in capacitors." And finally, some\nmagazines rent lists of readers who request certain information. For\nexample, Tektronics can rent a list of everyone who requested information\nabout test equipment OTHER THAN TEKTRONIC's, in the past 6 months.\n\nThe other point, in the data the advertiser receives, many magazines\ninclude how many items you circled on the card. If they want, the\nadvertiser can attempt to cull out the "literature collectors" from\nthe serious potential customers.\n\n"Can you say qualified sales leads? I thought you could."\n\nWhat's the BEST way for a hobbiest to deal with bingo cards?\n\n  Never circle more than 8 number on the card. If you want more\n  than 8 items, use the second card and mail it a couple of\n  weeks later.\n\n  If you are really, really serious and you really, really want\n  the information, CALL THE ADVERTISER AND ASK! This will also\n  cut about 15 days off the the response time. Virtually\n  everyone takes a voice on the phone more seriously than data\n  on a computer printout.\n\n  To help insure you keep getting a trade magazine that you're\n  not really "qualified" for, send in a bingo card at least every\n  other month and circle two or three numbers.\n\n  Include a business name and phone number, even if it's your house.\n  Advertisers almost never call.

I have a metex which is some \nmade up name, as I have seen the same DMM with other brand names on it, I \nbought it about 4 yrs ago for Aus$125.00 (convert that to US and you see \nthat it's definetly a cheapie.)

I'm not up on the details of US patent law, but I think this is incorrect.\nThere is a "reasonable use" exemption for *copyright*.  There is none for\n*patents*.  The exemptions from patent licensing are quite narrow; R&D work\nis exempt but personal use is not.  That is, it's okay to experiment with\na patented idea, but not to put it to practical use (e.g. to improve your\nstereo), even if it's only your own private practical use.\n\nOf course, it is unlikely that discreet personal use will ever be detected\nor that you will ever be sued over it.
I've used on-chip capacitors to reduce ground-bounce noise on a small\nsystolic array chip that had 50pF loads on the clock lines.\n(Design was in 2-micron n-well cmos, using the MOSIS scalable design rules.)\nHere are some thoughts on the bypass capacitors:\n\n1) They don't help much with simultaneous output switching--there is\n	still a large inductance between the bypass capacitor and the\n	load capacitor (on both the signal line and the ground\n	return), so you still get ground and power line bounce. \n\n2) They do help a lot with on-chip loads, as I had with the high load\n	on the clock lines. \n\n3) The transients you are trying to suppress are really high\n	frequency, so forget about large areas of poly-thin-oxide-diff\n	capacitors, since the RC time constant is too large.\n	What I did is to make a metal2, metal, poly, diff sandwich,\n	but put a lot of holes in the poly layer, allowing frequent\n	diff-metal1 contacts.  I forget exactly how wide the poly\n	lines were.  If I were doing this design again, I'd probably\n	omit the diff altogether, and use a solid poly sheet instead,\n	using just m2, m1, and poly (and substrate, but that has such a high\n	resistance it can be ignored at these speeds).\n\n4) You are probably better off trying to tune your circuit to run with\n	slightly slower edges and lower voltage swings (especially for\n	output signalling), than spending chip area on capacitors.\n	I had spare space on the die since the circuit was too big for\n	a MOSIS tiny chip, and the next size up was twice as big as I\n	needed. \n\nKevin Karplus\n-- \nKevin Karplus		karplus@ce.ucsc.edu

Here's a rough sketch of how the system works.  A reference station\nwith a very exactly known position computes the errors in the\nincoming GPS signals.  These errors are due to several factors\nincluding atmospheric distortion, SA (Selective Availability) time\ndithering, etc.  The reference unit contains complex computational \nequipment to "back out" the errors in its position (since it knows\nwhere it is already).  It then transmits these corrections on a \nbroadcast which is available to any number of relatively local\nreceivers.  If the receivers are nearby (<300km) and are using\nthe same satellites as the reference unit, the errors should be very\nsimilar for the reference unit and the receiver unit.  Thus, the\nreceiver unit may apply the corrections calculated by the reference\nunit.\n\nThe US Coast Guard is currently (as far as I know) installing a series\nof coastline transmitters for differential GPS.  These stations will\nuse existing radio towers.  I believe the frequency is to be approximately\n305 kHz.  There are many other private corporations offering DGPS signals\non different frequencies.  For example, PinPoint ((310)-618-7076) offers\ncorrection signals and receiver units using an FM broadcast system\nwhich has stations all across the US.\n\nThe correction codes are usually transmitted using the RTCM 104 format.\nAdvertised accuracies espouse 1 to 5 meter errors.\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\nJohn P.

Chiu knows the score and is just being\nsilly. However, "decibel" is in fact 1/10th of a bel. He is\nright on that one, but I don't know if it was accidental or not.\n\nStrictly defined, a bel is the ratio of the log of two power levels,\nand a decibel is 1/10th of a bel so you have 10X decibels for every bel,\nhence bel=log(P2/P1) and decibel=10Xlog(P2/P1).\n\nThe bel, ohm, volt, farad, ampere, watt, hertz, henry, etc. are\nall named for pioneers in the field. It's a traditional and fine\nway to honor researchers who discover new knowledge in a new field.\nHertz was one of the most important of the early electronics explorers,\nbut had been left out in having a term or unit named after him\nuntil recently, (1960's, prior to that what is now a hertz was a cps.)\nAll the other units were defined many decades earlier.\n\n\n \n\n\n-- \n----------------------------------------------------------------------

Umm, when I was doing sound reinforcement for a living, I used to get direct boxes (which convert\nunbalanced 1/4" jacks to balanced XLRs) for about $25 each, or a little more for higher\nquality. You'll need two for a stereo signal, of course, and a little adapter thingy from \nRadio Sh#$&^t to convert from RCA to 1/4". Total cost should be around $50. You can also buy\ntransformers for quite a bit less and wire them yourself. Total cost there should be under $30.\nYou can get all this stuff from any pro music shop that sells sound reinforcement gear.\nThe benefit? NO noise that you can hear will be generated in the cables going to the component\nwith the balanced inputs, even when you run them in bad places, like next to power lines.
Unfortunately, you're wrong on both counts.  The most common method of\nimplementing a tunable receiver is to have a local oscillator.  The\nlocal oscillator's frequency can be radiated out of the receiver via\nthe antenna unless the circuit is designed and constructed with great\ncare.\n\nFor a reference on detecting radios, get the paperback book _Spy Catcher_.\nThe author discovered how to detect radio receivers from their local\noscillator emissions back in the *1950s* while he worked for British\nIntelligence.\n\n  -Greg
Now there's a good idea ! All you need is 20 amps DC for a few minutes, and\na good (wetware) memory (was I using wp or autocad or ...). I thought of the\nsame idea myself a few days ago. I've got a fairly new car battery that I take\nalong in my 4x4 when I go camping, and it sits around useless when I'm home.\nI wish I could get a batteryless ups to use it with, or use it with a heavy\nduty 5-volt regulator to supply the PC. But I guess you'd need -5v and -12v \n(and +12) too (2 more batteries ?).\n\nAn alternative would be to leave a 40 AMP battery charger hooked up to the battery\nand run a 12vdc to 110vac converter running all the time, and when the power\ngoes out, voi-la ! the 110vac converter keeps on running off the battery ! and\nthen I could take the 110vac converter and my computer on the camping trips !-)

You still need to supply a proper ground for a Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter!\nSo rewiring is still a part of this job, however, the ground may be connected to\na local earth ground, rather than back at the breaker box.\n\nAs Jamie said, GFCI devices are required by code in a number of places, most\nnotably: bathrooms, and outside the house.  I do suggest the use of GFCI outlets,\nrather than the breakers.  You will end up with much less headaches.  Noise pickup\nin long cable runs is sometimes enough to cause frequent tripping of the breakers.\n\nGFCI devices do save lives, if you decide to install them, be sure to check them\nregularly (using the test button).\n\nRunning the family business (electrical supplies and lighting) for many years, I\nhave seen too many seasoned electricians fried, because they forgot to double check\ntheir common sense list.

No.  No.  NOOO!!!\n\nThe ground (green) wire is for safety.  No current is supposed to flow in it\nunder normal conditions.  This means that there's normally no voltage drop in\nit either.  It is supposed to be safe to touch the ground wire... even if\nyou're grounded in some other way at the same time.  \n\nThe neutral (white) wire is, as Dave Vanderbyl correctly said, the return for\nthe hot wire.  Since current flows in it, there's a voltage drop.  If you\nplug a heavy load into a properly-wired grounded outlet, you can commonly \nmeasure a volt or so of difference between neutral and ground.  \n\nThey are supposed to be connected together at the breaker panel... but nowhere,\nrepeat NOwhere, else.  (Well, almost.  There are strange exceptions for things\nlike sub-panels.)\n\nWhat you CAN do if you want three-prong outlets without additional wiring is \nto use a GFCI outlet (or breaker, but the outlet will be cheaper).  In fact,\ndepending on where you are putting your new outlet(s), a GFCI may be *required*.\n\nThere is a FAQ on electrical wiring, posted regularly to rec.woodworking and\nnews.answers.  It goes into great detail on these issues (including GFCIs) and\nyou should probably read it before asking any more questions.  I'll mail a copy\nto you, append a copy here, and will ask the writers to cross-post it here in\nthe future.

I had the insturment panel go out in my car (a 1990 Lincoln Contenintal) which\nis a digital dash. They replaced the whole thing with a 1991 dash (thank god it\nwas under the warrenty ! :-) Anyway, the odometer was reading the exact milage\nfrom the old panel. It must have a EEPROM of some sort in it that is up-dated.\nSeems to me that removing the battery would erase it, but it doesn't. So I\nguess they swapped the NVM chip (non-volitile memory) and installed it in the\nnew dash. No, they wouldn't let me have the old dash to tinker with :-(
How hard would it be to somehow interface them to some of the popular \nMotorola microcontrollers.  I am a novice at microcontrollers, but I am\nstarting to get into them for some of my projects.

: \n: \n: I really don't know where to post this question so I figured that\n: this board would be most appropriate.\n: I was wondering about those massive concrete cylinders that\n: are ever present at nuclear poer sites.

I hear that they're called\n: 'Cooling Towers' but what the heck do they cool?\n: I hope someone can help \n:-----------------------\nDuring the nuclear fission reaction the uranium fuel can get hot enough\nto melt. When this happens the liquid uranium is pumped to the cooling\ntower where it is sprayed into the air. Contact with the cool outside air\nwill condense the mist and it will fall back to the cooling tower floor.\nThere it is collected by a cleaning crew using shop vacs and is then\nreformed into pellets for reactor use the next day.\n\nCooling towers are a lot taller than they really need to be. Power companies\nare forced to make them that tall by some enviromental law that requires the\nraw uranium emisions to be held to under 1%. This law is now under attack\nby lawyers arguing that the 1% should be measured at the edge of the property\nrather than the edge of the cooling tower. Eliminating this law will save\npower companies thousands of dollars in concrete costs for new nukes.

I use an H11F1   FET optoisolater to switch microphone level signals.\nThere is no click, since I put a .1uF cap across the LED.  Distortion\nmeasurement are very low with mic level, and they went up to 0.03% at a\n+ 14 dB line level.  All I did was put the FET in series with one leg\nof the balanced line.  No hums, pops, just audio jumping out of silence.\nThe FET runs about 100 million ohms with the LED dark and drops to 150-200\nohms with it on.

Many thanks to those who replied to my appeal for info on a drive I have\nwhich is 3.5" 600RPM!!\n\nI now have some information on how to modify this for use with a BBC B \ncomputer. Not only do you have to change the speed from 600 to 300 rpm\n(tried that) but also change 8 components in the Rec/Play section to allow\nfor the lower data rate (250kbit, not 500kbit as it was designed for) and also\nchange the Recording Current to allow for the low data rate/rev speed!\n\nHopefully this should sort it all out .... not bad for 9 quid (normally 32 \nquid and upwards ....)\n\nThe drive is a JVC MDP series drive ...
I understand that the new GPS boxes now have an option\nknown as "differential ready".  Apparently land-based\nbeacons tranmit GPS correction information to your GPS \nreceiver (with differential option installed).\n\nHow does this system work?  What frequency is used for\nthe land-based beacons?\n\nThanks in advance,
My impression -- it's not an area I've played with much -- is that the\nmuch-beloved NE567 is basically obsolete.  If you want to detect a 1kHz\ntone, set a switched-capacitor filter chip to that frequency, feed your\ninput to it, and see if anything comes out the other end.  The NE567 was\nwhat you used when good clean bandpass filters were hard to do; nowadays\nthey're easy, and the results are better.
was\nto\n\n(snip!)\n\nI haven't been following this, so I'm sorry if somebody already mentioned  \nthis, but you could grab a lemon (I think potatoes work too, but I'm not  \nsure), a strip of copper, and a strip of zinc (I think you can get the  \nmetal in a hardware store or hobby shop, maybe??).  Stick the strips in  \nthe lemon (so they don't touch!) and you'll get a measurable voltage (not  \na lot, but, hey, it's a lemon :-)  ).  As I recall we had to hook  \nsomething like ten of these things to get an appreciable amount of  \ncurrent, because of the mondo internal resistance, but if you just need a  \ndemo you might get it to run a tiny fan or something! :-)
My next project is to come up with an IF/detector module for fast -- 112\nto 250 kB/sec -- packet radio use.  No fancy modulation scheme, just\nwide FSK for use at 902 or 1296 MHz.\n\nI'm a bit familiar with the Motorola 3362 chip, but I wonder if there\nare newer designs that might work at higher input frequencies.\n\nMy goal is to come up with an inexpensive design for a receiver "back\nend" with IF input on one end and an FSK demondulator on the other.  I'm\nparticularly interested in ways to use a higher IF than 10.7 -- do any\ncurrent chips work up to, say 150MHz with internal downconversion so a\nnormal IF filter can be used?\n\nAny suggestions?\n\nJohn
I'd like to see this info as well.  As for wavelength, I think\nyou're primarily going to find two - 880 nM +/- a bit, and/or 950 nM\n+/- a bit.  Usually it is about 10 nM either way.  The two most common\nI have seen were 880 and 950 but I have also heard of 890 and 940.\nI'm not sure that the 10 nM one way or another will make a great deal of\ndifference.\n\n	Another suggestion - find a brand of TV that uses an IR remote,\nand go look at the SAMS photofact for it.  You can often find some very\ndetailed schematics and parts list for not only the receiver but the\ntransmitter as well, including carrier freq. specs. and tone decoding\nspecs. if the system uses that.

Supposedly, the government rethought this\nsoon after, and Rogers was convieniently forgotten.\n\nThe bottom line is that all antennas that are grounded send HALF of\ntheir signal THRU the ground. The half that travels thru space is\nquickly dissapated (by the square of the distance), but that which\ntravels thru the ground does not disapate at all. Furthermore,\nthe published data showed that when noise drowned out regular\nreception, the underground antennas would recieve virtually noise-free.\n\nIF you find this hard to believe, then refer to the work of the\nman who INVENTED wireless: Tesla. Tesla confirmed that Rogers' methods\nwere correct, while Hertzian wave theory was completely "abberant".\n\n----\n ET   "Tesla was 100 years ahead of his time. Perhaps now his time comes."

I have never worked with really small signals before and have a few \nquestions about low level noise.  I have noticed that the waveform \nsynthesizer that I am using (Analogic 2020) has some relatively large\ncommon mode noise on it.  I am using this synthesizer to 'null' out another\ntransient waveform and am amplifying the difference (~200uV) several hundred \ntimes.  The 2020 has about 1-3 mVp-p of common mode noise and this tends to\nmake my measurements hard to repeat.  (The noise is not quite in sync with \nline frequency, and on a spectrum analyzer, the main component is about 64Hz).\n\nHow can I get rid of the noise?  When I look at the spectrum using an\nHP 3582A (audio range analyzer), the noise goes away the minute I switch to \n'isolation' on the input.  I am guessing the anlayzer has a diff amp on the \ninput since it will read accurately down to DC.
Does anyone have some information on the relative fraction of the final\ncost of each component in an average hard drive?  For instance, I'm pretty\nsure the heads and the platters are the most expensive parts, with the\nassembly costs running a close third.  Cost of the electronics is likely\nin the noise.\n  Any hard numbers ($$ or percentage)?

The Atari 2600 used a 6502 CPU, just like their entire 8-bit line\n(400, 800,1200,1400, 1440, 130xe, 65xe computers, as well as the 5200\ngame machine). The 2600 had some extra ASIC chips that were basically\nmodified graphics chips and PIA's for the joysticks. Later model 2600\nmight have incorporated many of the chips into one ASCI, as the weight\nof the machines and part count decreased a lot over the years.\n\nAdditionally, I think the 2600 used 2K, 4K, and up to 8K of ROM for\ntheir games. I have no idea how much RAM it had to work with, but I\nwould hazard a guess of 2 or 4K RAM. Think comes from a lot of hacking\nwith the 800 and 130xe computers. And occasionally hacking with the\n2600 (fixing it for monitor composite video use, and audio hookups).\nAlso I tryed to make a cartridge-less system that stored the ROM into\na RAM cartridge that could be loaded up at some prior time (a way to\nbackup cartridges). I've heard of a setup like this where games could\nbe bought (cheaply) on FSK-recorded tapes, then you would load them\ninto a special RAM cartidge, and play them.\n\nAnyways, if you're interested in looking for 2600 equipment, we've got\ntwo 2600 machines around (one composite A/V modified), and lotsa\ncartridges. Willing to sell for reasonable offer + shipping and\nhandling. Don't play it anymore, since going to computers + Nintendo\n(interested in that too?).

What is happening is this:\n1) You turn the TV on.\n2) The horizontal output begins normal operation.  This powers up the\n   high voltage and most of the rest of the circuitry.\n3) A problem is sensed and the horizontal oscillator shuts down.\n4) After it powers down the cycle repeats.
Here in switzerland, the situation is exactly the same.

As anywhere in an  \nadministration people don't like, if You tell them to work for the money they  \nget...\nThe problem is, that radio amateurs don't have the power to put trough their  \nrights in all cases.

Ok, so your a HAM.   Well, tune in 10.7Mhz or 455Khz.  These numbers sound \nlike some you have herd before?   Thats right, you guessed it, they are \ncommon IF numbers.

You are correct; the fastest "complete" image that could be presented on\nTV would be one field, which is 1/60 of a second (approximately).  Of course,\nthe phrase "TV screen" is often thrown around in reference to any CRT\ndisplay, so perhaps this researcher wasn't using normal TV rates.  Might\neven be a vector ("strokewriter") display, in which case the lower limit\non image time is anyone's guess (and is probably phosphor-persistence limited).
This is definitely the wrong newsgroup for this, but never mind.\nAny machine powered by heat (motor, steam- or gasturbine, steamengine,  \nthermoelement,etc) work the better, the bigger the temperature difference  \nbetween input and output is. Because You never get all thermic energy out of  \nthe powering medium (steam, burning gaz, etc), You have to eliminate the rest  \nof the energy to keep the efficency high. A thermal electric power plant (coal,  \noil or atomic power) works just the same way. You heat water (steam) to power  \nthe turbine and generators. Because You don't get the whole energy out of the  \nsteam (efficency is never 100%) You have to cool down this steam again by  \nsomething else. Most power plants use cooling towers for this purpose (some  \ntype of mega-refrigerator...). Others use water of a river (ecologically not  \nunobjectionable). Got it ?\n\nCheers   Robert  (HB9NBY)
--\n\nI would like to be able to detect the angular position (low accuracy) of an\nIR emitting source at a distance of about 100 meters (more is better) in\ndaylight.

The interference may have been caused by a radio \n   transmitter used for other purposes, such as police, fire,\n   etc.  If you heard voices over your stereo, I think you are\n   correct in assuming that the source is an RF transmitter.\n\n   If you have frequent trouble, you may want to try the RF ferrite\n   chokes available at Radio Shack.  The interference is probably\n   being picked up by your speaker wires, and those chokes can\n   be installed on the wires very easily (without cutting them).\n   Good instructions are included with the chokes.\n   If that does not solve the problem, you may want to search your\n   neighborhood for a radio operator.  Look for antennas on the roof\n   or car.  Talk to him/her about your problem.  There are things\n   a radio operator can do to reduce interference.\n\nAnd please remember to be friendly when approaching your\nlocal radio operator.  This person may or may not be the \ncause of your troubles,  and you'll get better cooperation\nand help if you assume that he is going to be helpful (most\nare).  It was amazing the accusations that we sometimes\ndealt with as I grew up.  We were blamed for skip (ghost\npictures on the TV that occur at sunspot peaks),  c.b.\ninterferance,  dead grass :),  you name it.  \n\nBTW, the local operator should try and help you whether or\nnot he or she is directly responsible.  It is part of\nbeing a good neighbor and that is how the FCC views it.\nToo bad they don't require the consumer equipment makers\nto take any precautions.\n\nLast, you can usually tell ham radio vs. CB.  Ham operators are\nrequired to declare their call (sign) every so many minutes (no more\nthan 10).  So if you hear "This is WA1QT" or some other call starting\nwith A, W or K and no more than 6 total characters, you heard a ham.\nCB'ers probably won't sign (I don't know that they're even required\nto) and fire/police have other private ids.
: I've started to look at some devices doing serial data transmission\n: over fairly decent distances in fairly noisy environments, and have\n: seen a variety of schemes for protecting the RS232 transceivers (and\n: the rest of the circuit) from transients on the serial lines.  I'm\n: left wondering what is the best way of doing this?  How necessary is\n: it?\n: [stuff deleted]\n: What is the wisdom on this out there?\n: \n: Ta,\n: \n: Martin.\n: \n: \nFrom what I know, protection is necessary, esp. if you plan to route\nthe cables into an unknown environment (out of your control). Things\nlike accidental shorts between the signal lines and power cables, or\neven lightning strikes are very likely and I don't think you like to see\nthe sight of your computer going up in smoke! [Even ethernet cards are\nprotected. I've looked at the one in my PC and the connector is\nprotected by a gas discharge tube!]\n\n{But if you plan to use the serial cables for internal routings (i.e. in\ncontrolled environments), it should be reasonably safe not to have\nthem.}\n\nSuggestion: look in the RS data book. They have several RS232\ntransceivers that have overvoltage protection. Among them include the\nLT1080, LT1081 and MAX250 and MAX251. The Maxims are suppose to be\nelectrically isolated ones but still need opto-isolators to work (don't\nask me why. I've never used them before.\n\nAnother alternative is an RS232 surge protector. Two are listed in the\nRS catalogue. If you need additional info (i.e. stock nos.), just e-mail\nme.

Recently I posted two oscilliscopes for sale.

My guess is it's repairable but more\nthan a simple calibration problem...but I honestly have not tried to\ncalibrate the scope or otherwise fix it. It's 'as-is'.\nI paid $60 for it in its current state (I bought it thinking I'd repair it,\nusing the 'good' scope for side-by-side comparison...since I've sold the\n'good' scope, the 'bad' one doesn't do me much good) and I'd like to recoup\nthat amount. As above, I'll accept offers and take the best one.\n\nI'd prefer a local (Bay Area, California) buyer, so (a) I don't have to\nship it and (b) she or he can examine the scope prior to purchase.
I am trying to build a circuit that detects the presence of video (Vs.\na blank screen) by monitoring the R,G, and B outputs of a graphics\ncard.  It should be able to detect the presence of a single pixel at\n65 MHz, which would mean detecting a 15 NS pulse.  It should also be\nable to tell the difference between a blank screen (about 300 mv)\nand a dim screen (say, around 310 mv).  Oh yes, it also needs to be\ncheap.  \n\nMy first circuit was a dismal failure.  I used 3 compariators; each\ncompariator had the + input going to one of the guns, the - input\nwent to a reference created by a voltage divider(a potentiometer).\n\nThe first problem was that the compariator was way too slow.. I\nneeded to get several pixels in a row before it would fire the\ncompariators, so I could have a whole screen full of text, but my\ncircuit would not detect it.   \n\nThe second problem is that there was more noise on the reference then\nthe smallest difference between a blank screen and a dim screen.  In\nfact the difference between completely black and completely white is\nonly 650 mv.  I am wondering if I am going to have to amplify the\nvideo signals to make this work.  \n\nThere are faster compariators, but they are expensive, and require \nsplit supplies.   I would need to replace my .49 quad compariator\nwith three 1.89 compariators, and create a whole new power supply\ncircuit.  \n\nAt this point, I think what I need is some sort of transistor\ncircuit.  Transistors are fast and cheap and should do the trick...\n\nUnfortunately, I am way out of my league when It comes to designing\ntransistor circuits, so I am appealing to the net for help.  Any\nideas, tips, circuits, pointers, references, etc. would be greatly\nappreciated.  \n\nOh yes, I only sample the output of this thing every second or so, so\nI don't need a fast response time at all, however, I haven't found a\nway to take advantage of that fact.\n\nThanks a lot for any help anybody might be able to give. Of course,\nyou will have my undying gratitude.\n\n\nSteve Verity

I am interfacing some simple circuits that run on 9V to my\ncpu board which runs at 5-6V.  The optoisolator is a 4N35.\nOn the led side, I put the signal I want through a 10k resistor\nto the base of a 2N2222.  On the transistor side, I tie my\ncpu input line to the collector which has a pull-up resistor\nof 47k.\n\nIt functions OK, but seems VERY slow.  I can detect pulses\nthat occur at about 2kHz, but not much faster.  Isn't the\nrise/fall time of this device, something like 5uS?  I should\nbe able to detect my target of 40kHz, but I can't get 16kHz.\nThis is done using wire-wrap and the wires going to the cpu\nand to the test pin are about 8 inches long, but I'm not\ndoing anything high-speed.\n\nIn the Art of Electronics, it mentions tying the base of the\nphototransistor to ground through a resistor to improve the\nspeed.  Is that what I need to do?  How do I calculate the\nresistor value?\n\n\n--

Actually the reasons you don't see so many cooling towers at fossil plants are\n1) fossil units (multiple units per plant) are generally smaller than\nnuclear plants.  300 MWe seemed to be a very popular size when many\nfossil plants were built.  The average nuclear plant is 1000 MWe.  2) many\nfossil plants were grandfathered when water discharge regulations were\nadopted ("why those old dirt burners can't harm anything, let 'em go.").  \n3) powered draft cooling towers, low enough to the ground to be generally\nnot visible from off-site, are quite popular with fossil plants.  4) fossil\nplants used to get much less regulatory attention than nuclears.\n\n\n\nActually the condensing environment is essentially the same for plants\nof similar size.  The issues are the same regardless of where the \nheat comes from.  Condensers are run at as high a vacuum as possible in\norder to reduce aerodynamic drag on the turbine.  The condenser pressure is\nnormally water's vapor pressure at the condensing temperature.  It is\ndesirable that the steam exhaust be free of water droplets because \nmoisture in the steam causes severe erosion damage to the turbine \nlow pressure blades and because entrained water moving at high velocity\ncauses erosion of the condenser tubes.  The coldest and thus lowest\npressure condensing environment is always the best.  \n\nA related issue is that of pumping the condensate from the hotwell (where\nthe water ends up after dripping off the condenser tubes.)  Since the\ncondenser is at a very low pressure, the only force driving the \ncondensate into the hotwell pumps is gravity.  If the condensate is too \nhot or the gravity head is too low, the condensate will reflash into\nsteam bubbles and cause the condensate pumps to cavitate.  This is a\nparticularly destructive form of cavitation that is to be avoided at all\ncosts.  \n\nThe hotwell pumps are located in the lowest point in the plant\nin order to provide a gravity head to the pumps.  How much lower \nthey must be is a function of how hot the water is allowed to get in\nthe hotwell.  Typically hotwell temperatures run between 100 and 120 \ndegrees depending on the temperature of the river water (this term is\nused to describe the river grade water even when the cooling tower\nsystem is operating in closed loop mode and essentially no river water\nis pumped.)  When the river water temperature is high in the summer,\noperators will typically allow the hotwell level to rise in order \nto provide more gravity head.  There is a tradeoff involved since higher\nhotwell levels will encroach onto the condensing tubes and reduce the\ncondenser area.\n\nAt least in the East and elsewhere where moisture actually exists in the\nair :-), the river water will almost always be cooler than the discharge\nwater from the cooling towers.  The temperature of the discharge water\nfrom the cooling towers is set by the ambient air temperature and\nhumidity.  It is very rare in the East to hear of actual river water\ntemperatures exceeding 70 degrees.  A vast difference from the typical\n"95-95" days (95 degrees, 95% humidity) we see routinely in the East.\nIt is not unusual, particularly where the econazis have been successful\nin clamping rigid discharge water temperature limits on a plant, for the\nplant to have to reduce the firing rate when the air temperature gets\ntoo high and the condenser cannot handle the heat load without excessive\npressure.\n\n\nTrue.  Actually secondary plant (the part that makes electricity and\nfeeds feedwater to the boiler) water chemistry has been the bastard \nstepchild until recently and has not gotten the respect it deserves.\nThe plant chemists have just in the past decade or so fully understood\nthe costs of impure water.  By "impure", I mean water with a few\ndozen extra micromho of conductivity and/or a few PPM of dissolved\noxygen.  Secondary water is now typically the most pure one will \nfind outside the laboratory.\n\nJohn

I recently bought an apparantly complete Expansion Chassis by Mountain\nComputer Inc.  It consists of a box with 8 Apple ][+ compatible slots,\npowersupply brick, interface card and ribbon cable to attach it to the computer\nto be expanded.  There was also included a small card with empty sockets on top\nand pins on the bottom that looks like it would plug into the ][+ motherboard\nsomewhere after pulling a chip.  There's an empty socket also on the interface\ncard and a short 16-pin DIP jumper like the ones used with ][+ language cards.\n \nThis technological marvel came with no docs and I haven't a clue as how to hook\nthis thing up.  If anyone has docs and/or users disk of any sort for this I\ncould really use copies of them or at least some help.\n \nI need to know:\n \no How to orient the ribbon cable between the card and the chassis.\no How to attach the short cable from the motherboard to the card\n  and if the small card is used.\no The purposes of the various jumper-pins on the card (it has more\n  of those than my CMS SCSI card!)
I've been thinking of sending into Mad magazine an idea for a \nparody, of those books entitled "How Things Work" that\nengineers buy their sons, which explain how engines, elevators,\nflourescent lights, etc. work.\n\nThe parody would be "How Things Really Work."

Ok, here could be the first question or answer or something:\n\nQ: I want to copyprotect a program I wrote.  How should I do it?\nA: You would be wise not to copyprotect that program.  You see, those \n   people that wants to get a cracked copy of your program will go to \n   various length to crack your program, and some of those crackers \n   are good, and know the common tricks.\n   So, the copy protection wouldn't stop those.\n   Ok, then.  What about legitimate users?  Copy protection can be a hassle\n   for legitimate users, and can hinder them in their work, expecially\n   if there is some "key" item that can get lost.\n   So, the copy protection wouldn't help much of the legitimate users, but\n   would make life somewhat of a misery for them.\n\n\n\n(This is my opinion, and I speak as a legitimate user :-)\nYou are of course free to have your opinion about this subject....

Here's one I hope some knowledgeable readers will make a comment or\ncontribution to:\n\nIn the State of Virginia radar detectors are illegal, period.  If\nyou are caught with one it will be confiscated on the spot and will\nnot be returned until after you appear in court and pay your fine. \nThe fine for having a radar detector accessible in a motor vehicle\n(even if it is not on) is $250.00.  Sorry, tourist, ignorance of\nthe law is no excuse - they will get you too!\n\nIt used to be that the only way the law could be enforced was for\nan officer to actually see the radar detector.  Not any more!  Many\nlaw enforcement agencies are now using radar detector detectors. \nRight, a super sensitive receiver that is capable of picking up RF\nfrom the radar detector itself.  My first reaction was "no way!" \nBut, guess again, these little buggers really work and the police\nare writing citations right and left for people using radar\ndetectors.  One news story quoted an officer as saying that he had\nfound the radar detector in all of the cars he stopped except one,\nand he could never figure out where it was - but he knew it was\nthere.  This tends to make one assume there are few false arrest.\n\nNow, before I get flamed, please understand that I do drive at or\nnear the speed limit.  I do not need a radar detector to keep me\nfrom getting a speeding ticket.  But, I do like to know when my\nspeed is being clocked or a speed trap is functioning.  My radar\ndetector now stays locked in my trunk when I am in Virginia (which\nis what they want - and yes, what the law says, and I intend to\nobey the law!) and is only used in states where it is legal.\n\nFor my fellow hams, I am not a microwave person - my mind only\nworks in the HF spectrum between 10 and 80 meters.  Microwave\nenlightment may be necessary.\n\nSo, the questions are -\n  What do the radar detector detectors actually detect?\n  Would additional shielding/grounding/bypassing shield stray RF generated by\n  a radar detector, or is the RF actually being emitted by the detector\n  antenna?\n  Are any brands "quieter" than others?
An Easy way to solve the problem is to use two op-amps to form the\nbalanced low-Z output, but this solution does not provide any\ngalvanic isolation between keyboard (or whatever plugged) and\nmixer. If no tight requiremets are demanded and some hum, snap,\ncrackle and pop sounds (formed by ground loops) can be tolerated,\nthe op-amp solution is just what you are looking for! (It is\ncheap...somewhat $10/DI-box).\nNot sure, but Craig Anderton did introduce one DI-box project\nin Guitar Player mag years ago (transformerless).....\n\n\nHope this helps.

We have a setup with with 13 polaroid transducers and rangefinders. We\nwould like to fire these three at a time with about 5 ms between\nfirings. The three that are being fired do not fire in the same\ndirection. \n\nTo further explain the situation, assume we are firing sonars A,B,C\n5 ms apart each other. We should normally see an echo on A that\ncorresponds to the distance. However, sonar A detects the INIT line\nof sonar B! The detection is actually through the transducer of sonar A;\nwe can see a very faint 50Khz signal on the transducer, exactly at the\ntime the init line of sonar B is activated. \n\nWe feel that there is some ground coupling that is causing this interference.\nWe came to this conclusion since we are using a separate power supply\nfor sonars B and C. \n\nHas anyone else had any problems with these particular units and\nthis type of experience? Your suggestions for remedies will be greatly\nappreciated.
Actually, it's a bit more complicated than that...I sounds to me,\nyour UPS takes in AC, rectifies it to DC to charge the batteries, and\nthen takes the battery DC and chops it to AC again, feeding your\nequipment.  This approach is the easiest and cleanest way to\nswitchover from the mains to battery once your power kicks out since,\nas you mentioned, nothing will know about what happened down the line.\n\nAnother way to do the UPS scheme is to use the mains until you\nlose power, and then kick in the battery backup with it's inverter to\nreplace the lost power.  The problem here is the switchover time and\nyou've got to resync the AC in no time flat.\n\nUnfortunately, most everything is built around the assumption that\nAC is available, so the UPS guys have to provide and AC output to\nbe usable...ya sorta have to make it work with what there already.\n\nSimilar story with our telephone system.  It was first invented back\nin the 1800's.  We're still using the same damn system (media) as they\ndid back then.  If I have a phone from back then, I can assure you\nit'll work on today's phone system.  It costs too much to overhaul\neveryone to a new system, so they make it work with what is out there.

The people who own are ex-UWA ... so that gives an indication of what the department is like.\n\nFor more information\nemail: yianni@swanee.ee.uwa.edu.au\nwith the above request and he should be able to tell some more info\n\nor write\n\nDepartment of Electrical and Electronic Engineering\nUniversity of Western Australia\nStirling Highway\nCRAWLEY 6009\nWestern Australia\nAustralia\n\n\nYours\nMark\n\nmtearle@tartarus.uwa.edu.au
Are you (two) joking?\nIs the entire Internet flaming you (two)?\nAhh!, now I remember that Ohmite company was the first introducing "the pink\ncolored resistor", only for electronics working females ;-)
yxy4145@usl.edu     Thanks a lot.
Heh, heh, heh, heh....I laugh because I have the same damn TV, and it\ndid the same thing!  Actually it is a Goldstar, but it's essentially the\nsame TV and electronics--just a different face plate and name.\n\n#1.  Fortunately, TV tubes don't explode.  I'd think the TV mfrs want\nto make this possibility remote as possible.  If at all, they'll \n*implode* and the glass that blows out would be the result of the\nglass boucing off the back of the tube due to the implosion. In any\ncase, don't kick it around! :-) \n\n#2  I fixed the TV after getting a hold of some schematics.  It turned\nout to be a blown 2W resistor feeding the flyback transformer.  I guess\nthe original resistor was a bit too small to dissipate the heat it\ncreated, burning itself out.  I checked to make sure the flyback wasn't\nshorted or anything first!  Oh, luckily, I had a resistor handy lying\naround that had just the right value for what I needed.  I can't see it\nbeing more than 50 cents!.
Wow, what a concept!  Does anybody want to speculate on how this\n"non-connection" would fit into the theft of cable services laws?\nIt seems to me that unless this case is specifically written into\nthe legislation that the cable company would not have a leg to\nstand upon in court.\n\nDoes anybody out there have any specific legal knowledge on this?
The pricing of parts reminds me of something a chemist once said to me:\n\n"A gram of this dye costs a dollar.\nIt comes out of a liter jar which also costs a dollar.\nAnd if you want a whole barrel of it, that also costs a dollar."\n\nI.e., they charge you almost exclusively for packaging it and delivering\nit to you -- the chemical itself (in that particular case) was a byproduct\nthat cost almost nothing intrinsically.
I need to reduce the speed of a Boxer fan by about 30-50%. I recall\nreading somewhere that the right capacitor in series will do it.\n\nIf this isn't a case of brain fade, can someone suggest the cap value ?\n\nThe specifics; It's a real Boxer Fan (tm). The label says 115 V, .2 amps.\n\nAl Dykes
Are any of the inputs to the chip coming from TTL?  Standby-drain specs\nfor CMOS chips typically apply only if inputs are pulled all the way down\nto zero or all the way up to Vcc.  TTL isn't good at doing the former and\nit won't do the latter at all without help from pullup resistors.  This\nsort of thing can easily multiply power consumption by a considerable\nfactor, because the CMOS transistors that are supposed to be OFF aren't\nall the way hard OFF.
Does anyone know what processor the Atari 2600 used? What I'm looking for is th\ne pin-outs for the Atari 2600.... the schematics for it it... does anyone have\nany idea where I could find this or any related information? This is very impor\ntant. Also, are the ROM chips that were used fo rthe 2600 games still available\n, or were they propreitary? Please email me with any responces, as this is very\n important.. Thanks a million...\n\nBTW- Anyone who works/has worked for Atari, I could really use your help with i\nnfo on the old 2600, please email me if you are willing to help me.... thatnks\nalot!!
1)  Output offset:  Obtain the service manual for the oscilloscope\nand adjust the internal output offset contorl.  There is virtual\ncertainty that there is an internal ajustment for the offset\ncontrol's zero detent position.\n\n2)  Verify that the function generator is properly loaded.  Many\ngenerators expect you to supply a 50 ohm load.  Go to a hamfest\nflea market and scrounge around for a pass-through 50 ohm\nterminator that has a male and female BNC (or whatever) connector\non it.  The calibrator on my Tektronix scope is designed to put out\n.4v into a 1 meg load, but .1 volt into a 50 ohm load.  You may\nalso find that loading the output of the function generator also\nreduces the harmonic distortion.\n\nBuild an attenuator.  You don't have to use (and I wouldn't want to\nuse) the input impedance of the device under test as part of the\nvoltage divider to drop the input test voltage.  Consider this:\n\n------10K--------+---------? ohm ----\n                 |\nGen            50 ohm            D.U.T.\n(loaded)         |\n-----------------+-------------------\n\nThink about the ratio of 50/10K and then think about the accuracy\nto which you can read voltages on your oscilloscope.  You can\nvirtually discount the loading of the D.U.T.  Also you have the\nmillivolt test generator you want.\n\nGood luck,

Gee, I got the idea from somewhere that devices like this were in common\nuse in WWII, so that commanders on board ships could bellow at the troops\nlanding on a beach, for example.\n\nWhich reminds me of an anecdote from the mid-60s.  At a communications\nconference a Marine Corps communications officer said he didn't care\nmuch for all the spread-spectrum multi-access expensive communication\nsystems that people were talking about at the time; what he wanted\nwas a kilowatt broadcast transmitter on the ship and a $4.95 Japanese\ntransistor radio stuck in the ear of every Marine hitting the beach.\n-- \nhaynes@cats.ucsc.edu\nhaynes@cats.bitnet
----------\n\nThis is not news.  In fact it's where I got the idea from, since it was\nsuch a neat item.  Mattell made it, I believe, modeled after a "space \nsaber" or "light sword" or something likewise theme-y.  My addition was \nusing a motor for continuous display, and polar effects in addition to \ncharacter graphics.  I should have protected it when I had the chance.  \nNo one to kick but myself...
My very favorite ad for such a device is on the back of the latest\nDamark catalog.

One not-so-quick question to throw out there for you guys...\n\nFor our class project, we need to design and build a power supply\nto the following specs:\n\nVoltatge:  adjustable from 1-12V\nCurrent:   *limited* at 1A\n\nVoltage must stay within 2% of designated value for I from 0-1A\nAC ripple less than 5 mV (rms)\n\nOf course, we can't just use an adjustable voltage, current-limiting\nregulator chip ;^)\n\nOur problem is with the current limiting (i.e. we've found stuff to\ndo the rest of the parts of the circuit).  What the supply must do,\nif presented with a load which would draw more than 1A, given the\nsupply voltage, is reduce the voltage so that the current will equal\none amp.  Thus, if we were to short the thing with the ammeter, we\nshould read one amp.  If we measure the current through a 1 ohm \nresistor at 12V, we should read one amp (and the output voltage, by\nnecessity, must be 1V.\n\nThe only basic idea we have seen for the current limiter involves\na circuit which will pull current off of the base of the output \npower transistor, and therefore reduce the output.\n\nSo, does anybody have any ideas we could work from?\n\nThanks in advance.\n\nAndy Collins, KC6YEY\nacollins@uclink.berkeley.edu

I would suggest Draw for Windows (by Micrografx).  I have this on my\nhome box.  Its quite impressive and only cost UKL100.  It has a rather\nnice clip-art library facility which you can expand with your own\ndrawings.  There is no circuit component clip-art included, but you\ncould add your own quite easily.\n\nIt works with any Windows printer driver of course, and can also\nexport embedded postscript and PCX files.\n\nNote: I am not connected with Micrografx in any way.\n\nPaul.
Brad,\n   For an antenna, gain is synonymous with directionality.  The only way \nto get gain (>1) out of an antenna is to design in directionality. The \n"gain" of an antenna is defined as the signal increase (for a preferred \ndirection) over the signal obtained by an isotropic antenna.

There are two issues here:  copyright and patent.\n\nThe magazine article's contents are copyrighted, and may not be reproduced,\ntranslated, etc., without the copyright holder's permission.  However, this\ndoes not cover the *ideas* expressed, only the form of expression.  Copying\ntheir circuit diagram or PC-board pattern is copyright infringement.  But\nit's unlikely that they could stretch copyright far enough to claim that\nthe circuit design itself is copyrighted.  So long as you draw your own\ndiagrams and lay out your own boards, copyright shouldn't be an issue.\n\nPatents are different.  The author does *not* have to give you any warning\nthat the design is covered by patent (although it would be sensible for\nhim to do so).  In fact, it's possible that *he* was infringing on someone\nelse's patent without realizing it.  Ignorance of the patented status is\nnot a defence against infringement, although it might reduce the damages\na court would award.\n\nHowever... unless there was something seriously novel about the circuit,\nalmost certainly it is "obvious to one skilled in the art" and therefore\nunpatentable.  Routine engineering is not patentable; patents (in theory)\ncover only inventions, ideas that are genuinely new.\n\nCaution:  I am not a lawyer.  Consulting a professional would be wise if\nsignificant amounts of money are at stake.
Hi,\n\n	Being a Electronic Engineering Student with only Electronic II under\nmy belt, I find myself *needing* to build a moderate wattage Audio Amp. So, \nI'll throw out a couple of question for the vast knowledge of the 'net'!\n\n	Please Explain how Watts are calculated in Audio Amp circuits. No,\nNot P=I*E, Just how it relates to one of the following:\n\n	Ai [Current Gain]\n	Av [Voltage Gain]\n	Ap [Power Gain]\n	or whatever.\n\nI already have a ?wonderful? cheap I.E <$20 schematic for a 20W amp, but\nI would like to Cross/improve the circuit. The problem is that the parts\nlist has IC1 and IC2 as NEC70001AB amplifiers. They look like ?11 pin? \nSIP packages with a heatsink. This schematic was published in a 1991 mag\nso it may be non-existant now. Anyway, I tried looking up a replacement in\nthe latest Digi-key Cat and found it  not listed 8(. The closes I could\nfigure was a 9 pin SIP as TDA1520BU. Anyone got any Ideas? \n\n	I thought, hey I can rin a PSPICE simulation using 741 opamp \nmodels. Yea, great! It worked. But, I guess the 741 wasn't made for High\npower amps. As a result, I got a Voltage gain of ~15mV/V. Worse than\nI started with 8(... Does anyone have a PSPICE CKT file with cheap yet\ngood gain? How about some models for some of the chips listed in this \nE-mail?

I'm looking for brief information on new\napplications of electronics (or new electronics in\napplications.) If you know of any interesting new\nstuff, I would be intrested in hearing about it.
One thing to consider is time division multiplexing the EMG\nchannels to reduce the number of RF carriers you have to generate.\nIf you multiplexed the EMG inputs at 10KHz, that would probably be\nsufficient for most physiology studies (you'd have ~ 330 Hz per\nchannel sampling rate.)  That level of analog multiplexing should\nbe rather easy to accomplish.\n\nCombining a lot of RF carriers is pretty tricky to do without\ngenerating intermodulation.  A system to be carried by a runner is\nin a fairly harsh environment and would probably be difficult to\nkeep balanced.\n\nA commercial hand-held transciever could probably be employed with\na little modification to accomodate widening the bandwidth.\nObviously, this has to be done in accordance with whatever laws\ngovern the use of transeivers in your location.
R >>>JD> ALL PC parallel ports that are compatable with the IBM standard,\nR >>>JD> including the original IBM adaptor, are bi-directional.\n\nNOT ALL PARALLEL PORTS ARE BI-DIRECTIONAL WITHOUT MODIFICATION.\n\nMy experience with the standard old zenith parallel port in their \noriginal 286s proves that.  They had the input direction disactiviated by \ntieing them R/W select line of the circuit to Vcc.  To make it bi ( which \nI did ) I had to modify it by scraping off the trace and solder a jump to \nthe proper location.  I thought that this was just lazy on the part of \nZenith ( they were not Zenith-Bull Group at that time).\n\n-rdd\n\n---\n . WinQwk 2.0b#0 .

A method which will directly (almost) provide you with the information that\nyou require is that which is commonly used for coordinate measurements of \nhuman body landmarks (eg. the SELSPOT system by SELSPOT AB, Sweden, and the\nWATSMART System ??).  These use lateral photoeffect detectors [Lindholm and\nOberg, 1974; Woltring and Marsolais, 1980] to determine the position of a\nspot of light projected (using a camera lens) over its surface.  In escence,\nthe detector is a large photodiode with four cathodes (one on each of the\nfour sides of the square detector crystal) and a single anode (the back of\nthe crystal).  A spot of light will produce currents which are proportional\nto the position of the spot on the detector's face.  Let's try some ASCII\ngraphics in 2-D (so the detector has two cathodes to detect linear position)\n\n\n\n              -------------------------> 1\n             |                       |\n             |                       |       |\\n           -----   cathode 1         |       |  \\n           XXXXX                     ________| +  \\n           XXXXX|                            |      \        -------\n    light >XXXXX|                            |        \_____ divider __ output\n           XXXXX|     |                      |        /      -------\n           XXXXX|-----| |--                  |      /           |\n           XXXXX|   + |    |         ________| -  /           1 + 2\n           XXXXX|         --- gnd    |       |  /\n           XXXXX|         \ /        |       |/\n           XXXXX| anode              |\n           XXXXX                     |\n           ----- cathode 2           |\n             |                       |\n             |                       |\n             --------------------------> 2\n\nIf the dot of light from the LED is the ONLY source of light, then the position\nof the projection is given by this circuit regardless of the level of illumina-\ntion (the divider is used to normalize relative to total received power).  When\nthis circuit is used in the presence of other sources of light, then the way of\n"tuning" to it is to sample for a few msec the background signal, light the LED\nfor an equal time and sample that signal separately.  The difference between\nthe two is the position of the LED.\n\nHamamatsu photonics sells linear and 2-D lateral photoeffect detectors, and\nthey also sell the required signal processing electronics.  The ready-made\nsystems by SELSPOT and others are NOT cheap ... \n\nLindholm, L.E., and K.E.

I am looking at buying a low cost (< $500) scope for general purpose use.\nAny recommendations? Is this info in a faq somewhere?\nAny pointers appreciated.\nThanks,\n  -Gerard.
The best info I have seen so far is the article "Joystick Metrics:\nMeasuring physical properties through the PC's joystick port" by\nMichael Covington in the May 1985 issue of PC Tech Journal.  It talks\nabout how to read all kinds of things (voltage, current, resistance) in\nBASIC, and even includes code for a simple "oscilloscope" display.\n\nIt's possible to read the joystick port directly if you don't want to\nuse BASIC.  The detailed information for this is in the PC Technical\nReference under Options and Adapters.  You have to provide some\nmillisecond resolution timing functions, but that's a subject which has\nappeared many times in articles from Dr. Dobb's, Circuit Cellar Ink,\netc.  Look for the public domain ztimer package on wuarchive.\n\nGood Luck,
Well, one reason for getting conflicting answers is that it depends on\nwhat you want the ground plane to do.  A continuous conductor is a good \nelectrostatic shield.  Do you have signals on your board that need\nshielding rom other things?  This shielding won't do much good for magnetic\nfields, unless you make it continuous around the circuit to be shielded,\nlike a Faraday cage.

I had a GE Emerson 13" color TV for about 3 years and one fine day,\nwhile we were watching something (I doubt if the program was the cause),\nwe heard a mild explosion.   Our screen went blank but there was sound,\nso we thought, 'oh we have special effects on the program'.  But soon\nthe sound stopped and smoke started to appear at the back of the TV.\nThe brilliant EEs we are, we unplugged the TV and called customer service\nonly to be thrown around by please hold, I will transfer u to blah blah..\n  Finally we abandoned the idea of trying to fix the TV and got a new one\n(we wanted a bigger one too!).\n After all the story, what I wanted to know is: Is my problem an isolated\nincident or a common one? (I recall reading about Russian TVs exploding, but\nnot here, in the US). Why would the picture tube explode or even smoke?\n I still have the left over TV set, I might dig into it this summer. Any\nidea where I can get parts for these things? (probably will cost more than TV).
No flames please, but I picked up this discussion a bit late and I \nam really curious...\n\nWhat exactly *is* the $25 network?\nSomething to hack together N serial cables?\nSomething with N serial drivers?
Well, they claim they are the only radio broadcaster with this\ninformation.  But the city's cable channel (35 in CableVision areas)\nshows this information map during travel times (6-9am and 4-7pm, I\nbelieve).  Most of the major LA freeways are covered.  The\ncomputer-generated map shows green, yellow, red, or flashing red\n(respectively: <40mph, 25-40mph, >25mph, and "incident"--I might be off\na little on the speeds, since this is from memory).\n\nI often look at this display in the morning to see if I really want to\nfight the traffic on the Sepulveda Pass or work from home for a little\nwhile to wait for it to clear.\n\nAnother poster explained the origin of the information: sensors (embedded\nwire loops) in the pavement near ramps and every half mile or so.  CalTrans\nhas had a "big board" driven from this data in their traffic control center\nfor some time.  I don't know if they are selling the data or if anyone\nwith the equipment necessary for its transmission and display can have\nit.
I've even seen pictures of an installation where the ham pulled a little \ntrailer behind his car with a 4KW generator, and ran the full legal limit \nwhile mobile. I don't know what his gas mileage was like, though, or \nwhere he found resonators able to stand the gaff.
Not according to the NEC nor the CEC, as explained in the electrical wiring \nFAQ, which I posted here separately.  Note the material under the headings\n\n\nand\n\n\nOf course, as they said -- "Local codes may vary". \n\n\nI'm not sure about this.  If the ground connections on the outlets are\nconnected to anything, they should be connected to a wire that runs back to the\nmain panel, where it is bonded to the neutral connector and to the house ground\nrod.  A connection to a local earth ground would not necessarily meet one of\nthe goals of the ground wire, which is that if a short develops from hot\nto the ground wire, enough current would flow to trip the breaker.  \n\nHmmm.  How are those orange "isolated ground" outlets (often used in\ncomputer rooms) wired?
A 1 of 4 decoder need not be the same as a 1 to 4 demultiplexer, although\nmany commercial SSI implementations allow you to use one as such. Strictly,\na 1 of 4 decoder need only take two lines in and make one output change\nstate, according to the inputs.\n\nA demux, on the other hand, uses two control inputs to determine which\nof four outputs will reflect the state of the input signal. So there are\nthree inputs required.\n\nA decoder can be used as a demux if it is equipped with an output enable\ninput, since this can be used as the data input (e.g. when high, all\noutputs are high; when low, only the selected (by control inputs) output\nwill be low).\n\nAn eight way decoder is created by using the high order bit (bit 2) to\nselect which of two four way demuxes is enabled. Thus you achieve your\naim of having only one output of eight reflecting the input bits. Note\nthat this method cannot be used to create a true eight way demux, since\nyou have no data input (the enable line on a four way decoder) left\nonce you commit the enable lines to their intended purpose.\n\nA sixteen way decoder obviously requires four, four-way decoders, plus\na mechanism to enable only one of the four at a time. Therefore, use\nthe fifth decoder, attached to the two high order bits, to provide the\nfour enable lines.\n\nOf course, the two low order bits must be connected in parallel to the\nfour final stage decoders.\n\nPlease give me the credit when you submit your homework.\n\nJohnH\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n      |  _  |_   _   |_|  _   _|  _|              Electronics Department\n    |_| (_) | | | |  | | (_| (_| (_| \/           School of MPCE\n    ---------------------------------/-           Macquarie University\n                                                  Sydney, AUSTRALIA 2109\n\n    Email: johnh@mpce.mq.edu.au, Ph: +61 2 805 8959, Fax: +61 2 805 8983
Hi there,\nCan anyone tell me where it is possible to purchase controls found\non most arcade style games.  Many projects I am working on would\nbe greatly augmented if I could implement them.  Thanx in advance.
1. Can low Voltage lights be controlled with an X10  module by putting it \nbefore the transformer? It seems to work, even the dimmer works. Not very \nreliable. Will it damage the module? Can it be done reliably?\n\n2. I put a motion switch (Heath) to a low voltage light, it worked but now it is\nbroken, too much current? How can I get arround that? \n  \n3. How can I increase the intensity of a light using the X10 PC computer\ninterface without having it go 100% on first and then down. I am doing\nmy own programing, not the X10 program.
Hi all!\n	Quick question.  Could someone please send me a pinout of\nthe cable that goes between a NeXT cube and the monitor?  Also,\nI am interested in the video signal (sync type, horz/vert rate)\nso any information on that would be greatly appreciated also.
Taft Electronics, 45th Street between 5th & 6th -- the only one left in\nwhat was once an entire district of electronics stores.  A little expensive.\n\nTrans-Am Electronics, Canal Street near 7th Ave -- lots of surplus type\nstuff.\n\nSeveral other electronics or "surplus" type places are still on Canal\nStreet.\n\nI think Bronx Wholesale Radio is still in business -- Fordham Road not\ntoo far from Arthur Avenue in the Bronx.  Also in the Bronx is NorthEastern\n(or was it Northwestern?  Northeast Electronics?) on Jerome Avenue near\nBedford Park Boulevard.  They're mostly a TV parts supply house, but when\nI was building CB radio projects, they were quite handy..
1) How was this testing done, and how many times?  (Calibrated speedometer?)\n\n2) It's not the "some cases" that worry me, it's the "other cases" :-)
I have a thermal fuse from a Apple Laserwriter II power supply (Made\nby Cannon) that I need to replace.  The fuse is not the standard\ntubular thermal fuse like those found in hair driers etc, but is a \nrectangular plastic package, much like a transistor or diode.  It\nis about 0.2"x0.2"x0.1", with both leads coming out of one of the\n0.1"x0.1" sides.  I have been told that it was made by MITI, a asian\ncompany, but I can find no information as to a supplier.  This fuse\nis rated at 1A, 130C.  Does anyone have a source for this fuse?  I\nonly need 5 or so, which means that the manufacturer wouldn't even want\nto talk to me, let alone, deal with me.\n\nPlease advise via E-mail.\n\nThanks,\nPat

At 50 miles, a conventional set of TV antennas on a pole (one aimed\nat each transmitter location) should work well.\n\n"Rabbit ears" inside the house are probably not adequate.\n\nGadgets to plug into your house wiring are even worse.\nAt VHF, you don't want a _big_ antenna, you want a _resonant_\nantenna.

You didn't mention whether or not cost is an issue.  Where\nexactly are you running 100MHz??  THe digital side?  TTL?\nECL?  We run 200MHz and 100MHz all over our IC test equipment \nall day long in the ECL domain, and we use DIP's along\nwith PLCC's, 25mil and 20mil pitch 256pin QFP's to name\na few.  I don't see a problem in packaging as long\nas you adhere to sound engineering practices.  \n\nA good source of information is Motorola's MECL System Design\nHandbook. The latest ed. is dated 2/88.  That is considered\nto be one of the *bibles* in high-speed design.\n\nThe very fact that you need to build a test fixture means\nyou're most likely going to need a socket.  It in itself\nhas far more inductance per pin than the package you are\ntesting, not to mention any impedance discontinuities.  I\ndon't see the big concern over the packaging because it\nprobably isn't going to make that much difference\n\nIf you're trying to get TTL to run at 100MHz, have fun...\nTTL was never designed to run in a 100MHz environment.\n:-(\n\naaron
Thus, a deciBell (deci-, l., tenth of + Bell) is a fractional part of the \noriginal Bell.

Both companies revolutionized electronics by\nsimulatenously realizing that the performance of connectors and sockets \nwere affected by the amount of current running through the wires.\n\nThe Ohmite company was the first to characterize resistances by numbers, thus\nour use of the Ohms...\n\n\nAlexander Graham Bell, actually, is where Bell came from...  \n\n\n\nActually, Bel refers
On an A/D board I've got, I'm using the A/D lines.  It measures \nthe voltages properly, ie: with a 7v power supply it reg's 7v and with \n5v, it reg's 5v.  Problem is when I've got the input voltage, and I wish \nto lower it via a resistor.  The sensitivity of the board is so great \nthat I can triger it with holding the 5/7v wire in one hand, and touch \nthe probe and it will register the full input voltage.  A 1m resistor \nonly lowers voltage by .1v so this is not too feesable. \n \n                What could the problems be and what else could I use\nto lower the input voltage?

I got a question from my dad which I really can't answer and I'd appreciate\nsome net.wisdom.\n\nHis question is about some 18-24" diameter balls which are attached to\nelectric power lines in his area.  He's seen up to a half dozen between\ntwo poles.  Neither of us have any experience with electric power distribution.\nMy only guess was that they may be a capacitive device to equalize the\ninductance of the grid, but why so many between two poles?.\n\nAnyone know what they really are?  Is there a related FAQ for this?\nIs there a better group to submit to?\n\nWe'd both appreciate some enlightenment.

I'm trying to figure out how to operate a Pioneer Laserdisc LD-1000 that I bought at a surplus store. It is reputedly from some kind of computerised viewing\nand/or ordering system. THere is what may be an HPIB connector on the back. When\nI power it up, the front panel power light comes on, but no activity, and the\ndoor doesn't open.

The subject line says it all. I'm working on a project\nthat will use a car battery. I need to pull off 3V and possibly\n48V at 3A.\n\nI have several ideas, but I'd prefer to benefit from all you\nbrilliant people :-)
The newest JDR Microdevices catalog has at least one variant of the HC11.
Fortunately, wire-wrapping is a better wiring technique than\nmost at high frequencies; Cray computers (up to the X-MP, at least)\nall had wirewrapped backplanes.  Wirewrap gets into trouble at\nmuch higher frequencies than any TTL can handle.  The 'increase'\nof wiring capacitance is not really relevant (you have to use\ntransmission line techniques, and the capacitance is no problem).\n\n\n\n	Hand-powered is a terrible choice (IMHO) unless you are\na field maintenance person who will do maybe a dozen connections\nat a time.  Your hands will cramp.  Battery-powered wire-wrap guns\nare available in the $150 range, and so are the little\ntwiddle-stick manual types ($15).  For a modest project, of\na couple hundred connections, I'd prefer to borrow a professional\nAC unit... or a pneumatic one.
Check with Kyocera America, Inc.\n           24 Prime Park Way, Suite 150\n           Natick, MA 01760\n\nThey are one of the largest manufacturers of IC packaging in the\nworld.\n\nIt sounds like you would be a good candidate for wafer probing or at\nleast IC probing to test performance.  HP, Cascade Microtech and\nTektronix should be able to help you here.  One note, testing at high\nfrequency accurately can be an *expensive* business.
Has anyone ever heard of FET-TRONS (or is it FETRONS, FETTRONS, ...).\nThese were FET replacement modules for vacuum tubes. I'm looking for\napplications where they were used.
Are you switching high level signals or low level signals like pre-amp\nout level signals?  Also, are the clicks you mentioning the big\nclack that happens when it switches or are you refering to contact\nbounce?  How are you driving the relays?  TTL gate output?  Switching\ntransistor?  How are the relays connected to what you are driving?
From my rather rusty knowledge of radio, most radio receivers use a superhet \ncircuit, so that the incoming signal is mixed with a local oscillator, giving \na fixed intermediate frequency (IF) that is more easily amplified. The\ndetector detectors work by picking up IF re-radiated from your radar \ndetector. In Britain, where one has/used to pay for a TV licence, there \nare/were TV detector vans prowling the streets, looking for people who hadn't \npaid their licence fee. They had a couple of long solenoid antennae on the\nroof, and I believe could triangulate an operating TV from the IF. \n\nI wonder how much of the IF is radiated back from the detector antenna, and \nhow much from the rest of the module. It might be worth putting the detector \nin a proper RF shielded enclosure.
Digi-Key also sells Quad Line Receivers, parts DS1489AN (68cents) and DS1489N\n(48cents).  A Quad Line Driver, part DS1488 (48cents), is also sold.  I guess\nif you don't won't to supply +12V, the chips with the pump-up circuitry might\nbe worth the extra cost.  But 1488's and 1489's are available at your friendly\nneighborhood RS, parts MC1488 (276-2520) for $1.29 and MC1489 (276-2521) for\n$1.29.

We used to buy Beckman 110 and HD110 ("ruggedized") versions for use\nby electricians in the steel mill where I work.   After a while we\ngot round to filling all the current-input jacks with silicone -\nelectricians have a regrettable habit of not checking where the last\nguy left the leads before using a 3 1/2 digit 0.5 % autoranging $400\nmeter to check if a fuse is good or not. Its very hard on meters\n(and electricians) when you put the milliamp shunt across a 600 volt\nbus. \n  But that's not why we stopped buying Beckmans - after a while a \nlot of them got "funny" in the LCD display.  A black stain would\nspread from one edge, or else they'd come adrift from those\nZebra connectors and fail to operate.    Now we buy Flukes, the\nlow-end 20 series mostly ( and we still fill the amp jack with \nsilicone). \n  What the world needs is a meter that won't let you change ranges or\nturn it on/off with a lead stuck in the amps jack - a little bit of\nclever plastic detailing would take care of this and make the world\nsafer for electricans, anyway.\n   Not that I've ever put a meter on the wrong range into a live \ncircuit, no, not me...not more than a dozen times, anyway....\n    Bill
I need a small battery powered hi voltage capacitive discharge supply to\ndeliver ~6 joules at 250 volts. This implies a 200uf cap.

I have an Adcom GFA-555 that I got in 1985.  There certainly isn't\nanything magic about it.  The components used are decent, but\nnothing uncommon with respect to consumer grade components.\n\nThe GFA-555 is a nice piece of equipment.

This is especially true for something as\nlow-technology as a GFA-555.\n\nI'd hope that a GFA-545 would still work well after several years.\nExcept under conditions of extreme abuse, there isn't much there to\ngo wrong.
I just installed a Motorola XC68882RC50 FPU in an Amiga A2630 board (25 MHz\n68030 + 68882 with capability to clock the FPU separately).  Previously\na MC68882RC25 was installed and everything was working perfectly.  Now the\nsystems displays a yellow screen (indicating a exception) when it check for\nthe presence/type of FPU.  When I reinstall an MC68882RC25 the system works\nfine, but with the XC68882 even at 25 MHz it does not work.  The designer\nof the board mentioned that putting a pullup resistor on data_strobe (470 Ohm)\nmight help, but that didn't change anything.  Does anybody have some\nsuggestions what I could do?  Does this look like a CPU-FPU communications\nproblem or is the particular chip dead (it is a pull, not new)?\nMoreover, the place I bought it from is sending me an XC68882RC33.  I thought\nthat the 68882RC33 were labeled MC not XC (for not finalized mask design). \nAre there any MC68882RC33?
:      Hello, \n: \n:    Let me introduce a problem:\n: \n:    When I measure a sinusoidal wave (voltage) with a digital voltmeter, using \n: AC mode, my output is an rms value (a peak value over 2 squared). / Right? / \n:    When I measure a square wave in the same mode (AC), my output is equal \n: to a peak value, actually, to the upper flat boundary of the wave.\n:    I assumed, that a digital voltmeter makes some kind of integration of the \n: input value, and divides it over the wave period. / Right?/\n:    Now, I used it to measure the same  square wave as above, but distorted \n: by high-frequency harmonics. Ideally, output should be the same, but...\n: The output value was only about 10% of the previous one! \n:    Why? What is the nature of this output value? What does the voltmeter \n: actually measure? And what does it show?  \n\n\nRe: RMS readings\n\nUnless the DVM *says* it's measuring RMS, it's probably Average voltage.\nThe input is diode rectified and measured as DC.  If it says it's RMS\nand but measures square/triangle/etc.  incorrectly, it's measuring\naverage and multipling by a correction that's *only* true for sine waves\n(i.e.  Vave*(0.707/0.63) = Vrms).  If you want correct RMS for (most)\nany waveform, you need a "True-RMS" DVM/DMM which literally does the\nRoot-Mean-Square calculation in either analog or digital circuitry.\n\n: \n:    Related question (less important to me):\n:    What are advantages and disadvantages of digital voltmeters to compare with \n: analog ones? \n\nThe last significant advantage of analog (IMO) ** was ** being able to\n"see" the signal if it was changing over time (e.g.  checking\nelectrolytic capacitors).\n\nAnymore, most DMM have bargraphs, etc. that duplicate this.\n\n: \n:    Thank you for your attention, you could mail me your opinion at\n: avm1993@zeus.tamu.edu or open a discussion here.

Assuming 68HC11...\nIn expanded muxed mode, you *could* do it. Much easier if you get a DRAM\ncontroller IC. The MMI 673102 could be used to implement this, or you\ncould use a counter and a huge multiplexer to provide row/column/refresh\naddress multiplexing. The thing with DRAMs is that they require wierd\ntiming, address multiplexing, and refresh.\n\nActually, if you wanted to use a 68008 IC, you could look at AN897, which\nhas a neat controller built in. There is also the 683xx, I think one\nof those has the DRAM controller built in. This one is for the 6664\nDRAM, however, the 41256 has only one more address line, adding only\nanother component or so. The 256k SIMMs are basically 8 or 9 41256\nDRAM chips (or their equivalent in fewer packages).

I don't want to get into a semantic argument, but contrary to some other\npostings "near UV light" /is/ "actual UV light."  The "near" means that\nit is close to the visible spectrum (i.e. of relatively long wavelength),\nnot that it is "nearly UV."  (I'm sure you can figure out now just what\n"far UV" is.)\n\nRegular incandenscent flashlight bulbs emit tiny amounts of UV in the\nnear end of the spectrum, such that a filter can be used to remove the\nvisible light and thus create a weak UV source.  Stronger sources are\ngoing to require gas (probably mercury vapor) discharge tubes (such as\nfluorescent tubes with UV phosphor).  Be careful, though; strong UV\nsources can cause physiological damage, especially to the eyes.  The\nshorter wavelengths are the most dangerous.\n\nIt wouldn't project a beam like a flashlight, but replacing the tubes\nin a portable fluorescent lantern with UV tubes would be a relatively\ncheap way to create a portable source.  It would be bright enough to\nbe useful, but not dangerously so.

The Fujitsu 2322 uses what is known as an 'SMD' interface (Storage Module\nDevice?).  A lot of older minis used it.  Sun still does on their server\nmodels.  There are several different speeds of SMD, and I think that the \nFuji drive you have is rated at about 24 Mb/sec (thats megabits).  There\nused to be several companies that made couplers for the PC (Interphase in\nTexas being one), but I think that the market pretty much has dried up.\nControllers for this type of drive are readily available for VME buses\nthough.  Rumor has it that there is a SMD to SCSI adapter available, but\nI think that it was designed for slower SMD devices.  In other words,\nif you have a PC or Mac, that drive is pretty much dogmeat.\nCheers,\nCorwin

: On December 29, 1992, it was illegal to operate a radar detector\n: in the state of Virginia.  If one got caught, one got fined $65.00.\n: Ask me how I know.\n\nThe Federal Communications Act of 1934 made it *legal* for you to\noperate a radio receiver of any kind, on any frequency (including\nX, K, and Ka bands) in the United States.  The Electronic\nCommunications Privacy Act of 1989(?) restricted the FCA of 1934\nby making it illegal to receive the land-mobile telephone service,\nincluding (I believe) cellular phones.  No restriction was placed\non receiving RADAR (or, curiously, cordless phones.)  Enforcement\nof the Virginia law is in violation of the FCA of 1934.  If you have\nlots of time and money (and a lawyer, which I'm *not*,) you can\nargue this in a federal court and try to have the law overturned.\n\nI can hardly wait to see the responses to this one, but somebody\nhad to say it...
No, the 6551A is able to operate in a 2 MHz system, the 6551 can only\ntake 1 MHz without problems.\n\nIf you see a 8551 made by MOS or CSG, take it, its a 6551A.\n\n\nI know no fixed version of the 6551. There are different possibilities\nto work around this bug. The easiest is to tie _CTS to GND and\nuse _DSR or _DCD as _CTS. It should be easy to fix the software,\n_DSR is bit 6 and DCD ist bit 5 of the Status Register (Read 6551\nwith RS1 = low and RS0 = high).\n\nUsing the _CTS-line can lead into big trouble. The 6551 _instantly_\nstops transmission if _CTS goes high. This means, that you may\nget only a half byte...\n\nGerrit
Does anyone out there have the toll-free (catalog request and order line) for\nHeathkit/Zenith?  Please post the number if you've got it!  Thanks.
I want to start a DSP project that can maniplate music in a stereo cassette. \nIs that any chip set, development kit and/or compiler that \ncan equilize/mix music?  Ideally, The system should have D/A A/D converters &\na DSP compiler.  A rough estimate of the cost is greately appreciated.\n\nThanks in advance.
Dear Netters\nI want to send EMG-signals from a running person to a computer. \nEach signal is 4KHz wide and there is up to 30 of them on each\nrunning person. The signal is only to be sent over a few hundred \nmeters. It seems to me that the frequency intended for this use is\nabout 150MHz and about 440MHz.\nTo make the transmitters as light as possible I suppose it will be best \nthe to send the signals in an analog form. As this application is rather \nspecialized I do not expect to be able to buy the exact transmitter-\nunits i need.\nOn the other hand I imagine that I can buy the receiver somewhere. I \nneed a multichannel (up to 30 channels) receiver or 30 complete  \nreceivers in some rack system where one can add as many receivers \nas needed in the particular case.\nDO ANYBODY KNOW IF THERE IS EXISTING SUCH RECEIVER \nSYSTEM ON THE MARKET?
I was wondering if anyone can shed any light on just how it is that these\nelectronic odometers remember the total elapsed mileage?  What kind of\nmemory is stable/reliable enough, non-volatile enough and independent enough\n(of outside battery power) to last say, 10 years or more, in the life of a\nvehicle?  I'm amazed that anything like this could be expected to work for\nthis length of time (especially in light of all the gizmos I work with that\nare doing good to work for 2 months without breaking down somehow).\n\nSide question:  how about the legal ramifications of selling a used car with\na replaced odometer that starts over at 0 miles, after say 100/200/300K\nactual miles.  Looks like fraud would be fairly easy - for the price of a\nnew odometer, you can say it has however many miles you want to tell the\nbuyer it has.\n\nThanks for any insight.

I, too, have a XC68882RC50 math coprocessor, which I installed\nsuccesfully in my Mega Midget Racer (clocked at 33 MHz). I have tried\nclocking my FPU at 28 to 50 MHz and it all worked just fine. I have a\nMC68030-33 CPU. I don't know why my FPU has an XC (my original 33MHz FPU\nwas label MC68882-33), but it seems to work fine on my system. Maybe you\njust have a bad chip.\n\nStefan
HI, I was wondering if anyone would be able to help me on twwo related\nsubjects. I am currently learning about AM/FM receivers and recieving\ncircuits. I understand a lot of things ,but a few things I am confused\nabuot. The first is the MIXER, to mix the RF and local oscillator\nfrequencies to make the IF. Does anyone have any cicruit diagrams (as\nsimple as possible) for this kind of mixer? I have come across a\nMC-SBL mixer chip But I have not been able to find it in any catalogs\n(ACTIVE,etc...) \n\nAlong the same note, are there any SIMPLE fm receiver circuits anyone\nmay have stashed away somewhere and they couold let me see?.\n\nP.S. any REALLY GOOD BOOKS on AM/FM theory ALONG WITH DETAILED\nELECTRICAL DIAGRAMS would help a lot.\nI have seen a lot of theory books with no circuits and a lot of\ncircuit books with no theory, but one without the other does not help.\n\n				Thanks,
I used a bunch as weights, when building a model airplane.  Hung them\non the stringers, across the stringer, or whatever.  Worked pretty well.
Do you know if there is an airport nearby? They may just be markers\nto tell pilots of small planes that there are power lines nearby.
Firstly, I would never consider trying to make a one-shot timer. Your 2F2 cap\nwill have been designed as a RAM battery substitute, rather than for use in\napplications where you wish to drain the cap with a constant current. Their\nperformance, in some respects, is more akin to batteries than to a normal cap.\nThe other point is that big electro's are usually rated with -5%+20% tolerances,\nso calculating exactly what capacitance you have (particularly when considering\nthe cold).\n\nYou should be looking at designing a micropower oscillator and divider chain,\nthat "rolls over" (from zero to maximum count, or vice-versa) once every\n1,209,600 seconds. If you were to use something like a 110Hz clock, you would\nneed a divider chain of 2^27, to give an error of less than one percent in the\nfiring times over the six week period. Of course, you could trim the 110Hz\noscillator to give you exact time, but the likelyhood of the oscillator\nremaining exactly constant at -40 is low anyway.\n\nI would suspect that there would be far more battrey drain in firing the\nsolenoid than there would be in the timer circuit.\n\nCaveat - I'm not experienced in low temperature electronics, so I can't\nguarantee that this (or any other) approach is the best for inhospitable\nconditions.\n\nJohnH\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n      |  _  |_   _   |_|  _   _|  _|              Electronics Department\n    |_| (_) | | | |  | | (_| (_| (_| \/           School of MPCE\n    ---------------------------------/-           Macquarie University\n                                                  Sydney, AUSTRALIA 2109\n\n    Email: johnh@mpce.mq.edu.au, Ph: +61 2 805 8959, Fax: +61 2 805 8983
As the subject says - Can I use a 4052 for digital signals?  I don't see\nwhy it couldn't handle digital signals, but I could be wrong.  Anyone have\nany advice?  Thanks.

When the tube fires, insufficient current runs through the \nstarter to keep the heat up and the bi-metalic strip straightens out \n(O/C).\n\nBTW, I too thought that they were nothing more than a small neon, so one \nday when the neon in my sisters digital (flip the metal squares type) \nclock broke (flimsy leads), I replaced it with one from a starter.

In four replies, I've seen no hard numbers, so here goes:  For traces\non the outside (not inner layers), expect, in 1 oz copper, at 15 amps,\nthe following temperature rises versus width.  This is from Sams'\n"Reference Data for Engineers," seventh edition, Pg 5-30, which claims\nin turn to be from MIL-STD-275C...\n\n    width   Temp rise\n    inches  degrees C\n    ------  ---------\n     .125	100\n     .15	 75\n     .17	 60\n     .20	 45\n     .24	 30\n     .33	 20\n\nAt 10 amps, the rise for the .125 width is only about 30 degrees.\nPower goes as square of the current, plus the copper resistance goes\nup as temperature goes up...  Certainly .20" (~5mm) traces should be \nample for what you want to do.  And 2 ounce copper almost cuts the \nrequired width in half.  (I'd do 2 oz at about 0.08" width myself, \nI think...given that the _rated_ current is 10 amps and the 15 is\na transient or fault condition.)
Yes, but... the minimization of gates is important in part\nbecause of TIMING considerations.  A TTL gate has the basic structure\nof AND/OR/INVERT, and an inversion of a sum of a product is just\nexactly ONE gate delay.  The reason to find a minimal sum of products\nis that this matches a hardware optimization.\n\n	A positive-OR gate (such as the 9-gate solution uses) has\nTWO gate delays (and there's another gate delay in the second term)\nso that the second solution, while simpler in logic symbols, can \nbe expected to be something less than optimal in the real world.\nECL is similar to TTL, in that it can support an OR/AND\ngate with the minimum delay (unlike TTL, you get both true and\ninverse outputs for 'free' when using ECL).\n\n	PALs are basically large programmable AND/OR/INVERT\ngates (with your choice of internal connections between the\nvarious sections, and perhaps some latches), so a minimum sum\nof products ALSO is a way to shoehorn a logic design into \na few PALs.  It's not comparably easy to design with a minimization\nof logic gates, but some software packages claim to allow you to\ndo so, and will take just about any mess of gates (as a nodelist\nwith 74xxx series logic ICs) and produce a description of\na logic cell array to do the same job.  Xilinx's XACT software\ndoes this by treating each logic block as a macro, and expanding\nit all out, then simplifying.
